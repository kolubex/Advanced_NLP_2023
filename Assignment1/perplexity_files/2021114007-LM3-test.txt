and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times d artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels   12.252845749727864
at the same time added château renaud your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti   21.222367287457182
very well said mazarin if i place you in security in a manner evident palpable ah   17.070373583322066
at the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat   15.603952758392749
bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence   9.152147371211107
it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls   4.266964794452306
the gate once closed and debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked what was the matter with you hermine   22.47124432990242
my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive   13.714423231338738
so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are   9.591342776960301

the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves   7.691334108833509
i no longer begged for liberty but memory   13.406981198830511

then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris   11.817101710448883
the fact is that i do not doubt your eminence s genius will repair the blunders of his agent is that it   7.193140835578104
demanded aramis   13.727601485212304
i gave him the helm and descended   13.080620026195236
well   18.658612976390824
on entering the court of his hôtel buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestibule   10.386382513253482
said d artagnan to himself i believe he has become more gascon than i am   6.216870960877975
that s impossible said the gentleman   15.916880826052255
but what are your intentions   9.193956742554219

i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthy that of being the husband of mercédès   17.02447583539422
there is no providence all comes by chance   14.66657786635294
pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their steeds   15.220086786644861
but you received it with enthusiasm   14.522264525202473
you were always a merry companion my dear d artagnan he said and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you   10.958094735380957
why   18.709416066710414
oh yes   17.118106577821553
said milady   17.75131962042827
for if my lord should be overtaken and caught there s every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to be hung   14.7657751606229
perfectly   12.606607890885906
alas   14.20333084427633
but what is it   7.2224260615623646

not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass   15.49960908593979
cried the three friends   13.548288494754575

a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard   17.78805405271821
joannes the jeweller   17.388120542043872
precisely so cried monte cristo precisely so   10.42807113466763
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales   10.527432668074473
d artagnan concealed himself in his closet   14.865427937188812
what do you think aramis   15.022227349564695
his father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his forehead   10.98526198722459

danglars listened with the most profound attention   17.658872931866615
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us   11.127432628638385
the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nîmes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the child he might become acquainted with your person nay he might even then have known it   14.93289769242006

debray is one of your friends   16.1184957195056
the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when d artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in a choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing   17.235152681824182
the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom   21.35533332457878

said the duke   14.21045297662526
he waited then in the ante chamber with impatience till he should be conducted to them   10.37346356462065
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he   15.56584904041657

i listen   10.720176329113745
now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither   4.384019288412819

in the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard is   13.270435506253234
how so   11.305975887906625
madame de villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange preliminaries   12.914814420633434

the cardinal took the letter and read it with the greatest attention   12.107619007195778

the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honoré itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris   13.685119929289804
when are you coming to the point   12.484419992551642

grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his arm   1.187252373824883

villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dantès patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleon s return   9.718425712513667
but know beforehand if you kill me or cause me to be killed my precautions are taken   21.278721251575718
cried the poor tutor   6.9392015062810515
his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he was   15.58531518417726
he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of   16.32545524976921
what signal   15.927997061537814
oh oh   17.552911944686887
a week passed by   18.914210937915453
noirtier   11.661461778197264
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon   13.898710426376065
it appears sir that this edmond dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another   15.163238942413592
but outside your orders there is a service you can render me   15.071456044573946
they will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate   11.484581530465453
the bargain was concluded   7.608451458479274
marquise said villefort approaching his future mother in law i request your pardon for thus leaving you   13.050866039909614
he is staying then at the hôtel de londres with you   5.266422713917784
speak sir and pray begin at the beginning   14.057101604661181
at that letter the old man signified yes   13.361019672030835
said the officer everything is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house   17.69152239584681
and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when i marry   6.246135380463085
silence   4.33517292282255
what i have said i will do   13.056592532761535
let us gallop if our horses will consent   11.10308902374135
and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m   8.959092695312426
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon   14.966709506670497
the ground is soaking wet   12.453652761202218
andrea had spoken very little during dinner   11.930060391210418
he denies himself nothing   11.478936906078513
but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come   17.877496337322185
haydée said he did you read it   10.64355435991836
the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the king s service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers   5.036594861676702
let go the bowlin s haul the brace lower the top gallant sails haul out the reef tackles on the yards   11.009897667116347
aramis   9.706259152362291
the man was an enigma to franz   16.517332646278987
he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner   13.029283831594649
with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home   10.929307338284607
i was three years old said haydée   8.881635483758847
then he raised the flag stone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber   12.998498538311523
and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament   5.39384294087845
that is lucky said blaisois   14.469057033369442
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire   13.68792761658813
no said d artagnan it is in advance   7.478893073422207
s   17.510266676110984
albert sprang from the porter s lodge to the steps   12.492362165949505
oh heavens exclaimed monte cristo can my suspicions be correct   11.784946469667274
yes   15.930987877367103
here   10.816740367243787
mousqueton collected a store of crusts   15.904673673730871
but she declined availing herself of it   10.208418065245496
he would shoot dantès and then kill himself   10.590800663737808
can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you   9.602054411064055
come she added   8.02529958398744
asked d artagnan drawing more pistoles from his pocket   8.073785025500428
the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the cardinal   7.590392886068145
s blood   9.583366253976322
what then has monsieur de flamarens been telling me   15.14676082237212
before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistols one in front of porthos and the other of d artagnan   11.452281746284363
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill closed door and the door reopened   11.345645438710491
ah mon dieu   8.11574044894942
i shall compliment mademoiselle danglars on her cameo while the father talks to you   22.062100680718707
said dantès staggered at the enormous amount   9.910875135027844
in what way   13.387156138595813
caderousse s knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry   9.6566591105585
yes you   8.870667170358558
i do not wish you to be seen leaving   8.68914986914061
his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections   8.662486290042533
it is eleven o clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king charles i   12.441918304195669
count said de winter for whom do you take me   6.696486031729114
why was not m   9.605627677216894
you come from noyon in picardy   10.295323577133965
begone then   14.390876607451906
m   11.758266279569906
take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever   15.59204696521942
no count of monte cristo added debray   5.479014034148418
cried porthos as if in pain   9.772700455150872
who o o pla   5.904376217729692
instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another   12.017390844298472
then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves   12.431002301076115
ah   7.566542760464526
how   12.93375834668982
yes that disturbs you   17.055978346396593
ah to be sure cried porthos there is a diamond   18.99357667279564
i was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of la réserve the day before i was to marry you a man named danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman fernand himself posted   13.045643985850003
but continued d artagnan how did you escape   6.825942714984806
said morrel   7.569249857642059
i dare not say more in a letter   15.236738074986441
when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that   17.713917537283507
oh heavens   12.475665645216132
at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor   12.224718632115696
these fellows were drunk said athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her door   10.44616864183551
albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent   9.335455080053915
ah my dear m   15.087953635410091
besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party   3.082741737457983
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors   12.420317641036243
if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve   12.604347006468458
she would tell me nothing and i departed   13.948764070509233
that is very well before one is over forty   6.132179424966255
alas   9.724890184629633
said gondy   12.130525275495687
the poor boy wherefore   14.074683682349638
precisely madame replied monte cristo   13.83715995271066
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variétés   17.877040603662017
something of this i heard in epirus said monte cristo   15.315545457081042
athos has made me see that s all   7.925903125759394
you jest sir   11.486913048886732
look   12.03745460353307
be careful   15.073049050485075
that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable   5.81138492547488
good   18.815651324062657
something was at work on the other side of the wall   3.7202694663569993
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard   12.061673064823108
now monsieur porthos once more and this is the last   2.525899769682173
that falls out oddly   10.272031946163132
no matter this was a greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor   10.106348463953218
but you will find terrible charges   12.991280293569757
the young man s implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to d avrigny   7.861585953348499
he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape   16.269728598081574
look at the comte de la fere a type of nobility a flower of chivalry   10.551760119291968
if he demands my daughter let him fix the day declare his conditions   14.57377520793511
but he did not succeed   17.441275803123816
what do you think of that exploit my lord   12.709973533831935
come then let us go to your friend s house   19.577884864109038
everything is turned topsy turvy in the world nowadays   14.342173512417633
i am very anxious to see this man   11.285827709557656
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states   11.08484939806978
we shall know be assured   11.908907762680952
the two ladies entered the drawing room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication   9.731061851261703
i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity   11.900472449516187
mme   17.4036861394744
had you not better repose awhile   14.494638663906283
suddenly a great light appeared on the strand   17.34828849241871
he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing beauchamp s arm my friend said he my life is ended   8.41937820205201
are you quite sure of it   11.37551956273398
you are exaggerating athos   7.508740043569832
was not faria s fate the better after all to solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering   16.91008246552787
alas   14.02587066025074
i need to know whether i am among enemies or friends   13.11967673214129
yes madame   14.866942262581114
english and french chapter xxxii   17.43175197918807
three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic   18.040451538033317
however he regrets your absence extremely   13.234627251844437
when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what i require from you   10.496102697560021
it must be the son of mère simon who has stolen them   14.639330892945555
so young   14.472503644078328
a passport for embarkation must be obtained   16.692918019775796
how could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income   8.866645461680811
i will tell you the real facts   14.176158455343135
misfortune refreshes the memory   13.627042525413913
repeated morrel   10.31001507941327
at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times   14.663922198192408
you ought to know   1.4160832884286005
dantès your health   14.791828764869544
this time d artagnan was only in part mistaken   12.155110967291009
behold madame   12.150261895360773
he shall die   17.626864665950098
and i set fire to the villa san felice to procure a wedding dress for my betrothed   5.699128368444246
mousqueton had a magnificent livery and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his life that of standing behind a gilded carriage   9.82333616488223
but your eminence is mistaken in saying that i am young   6.393935361236095
de tréville   12.296222718701463
i shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions   17.612424903168044
i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool   12.733533714411323
my lord i beg your highness s pardon but i must beg for half an hour s leave of absence   4.967870428992331
at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late   8.846885534301993
the gascon and the italian   8.613655050928433
cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit   4.431009414502236
i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken   12.758638671643064
this jewel he bestowed on dantès upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement   19.563949005001994
my pastry not good   8.66287405253816
everyone waited anxiously   10.17282641136219
take my wealth my fortune my glory all the days i have to live for such an instant for a night like that   15.362662967771541
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies   8.474018576398436
you my dear monsieur de rochefort shall have the post of confidence   23.99713063915175
mousqueton cried d artagnan let us be off   6.7953031264963375
the man of meung   18.612882355975508
they are three superb animals   10.931832161212238
oh growl as much as you please cried lord de winter but don t try to bite for i warn you that it would be to your disadvantage   7.262799034029626
de tréville to the others as may be perceived   18.603676038879662
it is quite true   11.872994562837794
milady faltered d artagnan and fainted a second time   7.3270840342468535
the invalid s eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable   23.481586897691045
ah that is just what i can not tell you   9.575370104582612
why do you not realize a six months a year s advance even and retire to brussels   12.396009658439388
were i compelled to marry another i would destroy myself   2.663448695293539
athos then called olivain   14.707318506108262
by force   16.143236717663456
the inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition   11.918431148245846
signor pastrini had promised them a banquet   9.114553097325857
haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow   9.68517926491367
the rascal is rich then   12.297874892567886
in a moment that part of the floor on which dantès was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way   6.6681063589612934
we shall meet again master d artagnan continued the leader raising his voice   20.049762382457295
my friend said aramis take care   9.155224058354616
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent   6.118242152675894
it was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached   14.228903880468547
then continued athos we have another reason   4.789415622229645
is it to make me a captain   13.49385875152226
ten thousand devils   10.124149684314544
bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man   22.013686477067196
d artagnan answered with the greatest simplicity i came to paris with exactly such intentions   10.273608782547651
perhaps she is pretty   6.612685503504484
i will call thee mouston   16.639737439202065
and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room   12.084962555880093
but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake   13.846511318066558
but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask   6.065516615502685
he will follow you   9.397482059637124
asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vexation   16.739533243900503
now gentlemen said athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel let everyone retire to his own apartment   20.30121360097752
tis instinct your honor   9.99549898539566
and assured that he was at the catalans they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring   12.753542148372132
he was struck by a sudden idea   20.301658906318142
30279m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life   12.569543133485258
he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men   16.238603906244027
you are right said felton after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her   21.349734278006494
but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner   15.160006433644885
50179m king s attorney   13.288733667074407
the london executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services instead   17.794301720940474
his person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress   11.561158267051532
when we have a fog   13.81659874837536
you are the offended party count   6.559779375416518
he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste   18.254916323458353
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door   18.749939878244707
but said the baroness i thought you never put the money out to interest   8.245881186183677
what is that   11.723334016833375
this way gentlemen this way   9.364583711759874
i was indeed alone no noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night   15.24997243746523
this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man who a rather improbable thing had stolen his father s letter from him was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred   13.969653130353507
and fearing that not   13.696523312323263
the great cardinal   12.353077819512112
take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever   12.29517310462398
perhaps your love will make me forget all that i do not wish to remember   7.166145417719511
she who mistaking you for the cardinal s guards has just fled away   4.690397733334708
we are near athos s door   19.069114682101393
the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese   5.5865846962092744
since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman   16.688281877375353
chapter 25   12.961256131471595
chapter xliv   12.858529346110991
and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the garden walks   17.286938202451477
debray has just seen you at my house   9.973721289007019
with the duke s aid they already considered themselves invincible   13.184945250538679
mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man   7.524569486942068
porthos shrugged his shoulders   10.16075641683556
i have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it without any fault of mine i can honestly declare   17.006032274055325
30043m a quarter of an hour was the reply   12.88293307160046
then a singular thing occurred   11.56332563854655
yes to night   9.798720928920693
ah cursed gascon that i am i get from one hobble into another   15.040892047835793
chapter xxxiv   8.166963237916875
only i took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for i had no doubt i was watched   12.026776862512458
i own i was seeking them   15.72006108194774
many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and m   14.477694122151684
oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur d artagnan is right   8.755870436670929
i say our country because you were born not far from marseilles   13.540680089401247
then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold   16.48078778422071
i have that of the garter which king charles i   13.22227048184199
ah indeed   11.913806682009847
no it is for the first expenses of your settling in paris   10.558935126249512
monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman   11.148742815003734
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence   13.014227919248986
de morcerf will accompany me   9.893123003755136
you are the king of poets my dear aramis   7.998027927760569
adieu and think of me   17.537249455430413
this man was our old acquaintance gaspard caderousse   15.492616604047027
the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility   16.41029860711742
said danglars   4.685318282386253
pardon for what   11.072761332991147
in fact m   9.719789522677956
copies were put up at the corners of the streets   17.451775631346255
f   10.916593833301842
the moon lighted the group   17.025745379839897
then listen to me   7.6799399024920705
thank god we can keep a secret   14.107756577805787
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards père lachaise from the faubourg saint honoré   20.13346182618421
the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince   8.176015495976165
de tréville had foreseen   13.351778306829582
but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears   11.921949114105566
you are mistaken porthos said d artagnan   8.933062094280658
then in the long days on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails edmond with a chart in his hand became the instructor of jacopo as the poor abbé faria had been his tutor   12.231756575474094
then we shall not meet in paris   5.114567861455118
ah m   18.784964341141574
a thousand pistoles   20.515455979957302
where is this dear aramis   7.730069362385253
but what is there to investigate sir   12.152797675504289
let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion   10.859718380678395
i know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said baptistin   14.481230957752299
the masks could not appear   10.161124926041287
yes yes madame you must   11.88736421118936
said the colonel   15.071428258712341
do you desire it as ardently as you say   12.322522563821822
come will you do to day what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen   13.846716491892769
yes i have received what   14.981139137480158
here they are   12.850215878761169
i knew very well that they tired out their executioners but i did not believe them so strong against their lovers   5.833187018005016
he offered him 1 000 francs for a mouthful of bread   11.46843562341503
do as you like she said i rely upon you   11.30279463160836
and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller coin   22.340533093986885
no matter i was aware of his intention   11.134934693066649
my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which d artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same   14.053718416553354
3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister   13.386874200751183
the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction   9.758096577126048
monte cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few words with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared   7.914346781285349
bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening   5.744788414071447
alas my dear friend said faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not and i need not attempt to explain to you   14.250103240400712
madame de saint méran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived   9.947641654554559
madame said he i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant   14.686294668563395
and now of louis philippe   12.990394576612395
thou hast become a horse stealer   11.524496112910764
it is very hot said athos drawing his sword in its turn and yet i can not take off my doublet   11.266567136910615
said the queen   10.752672555980013
it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it   11.518056078979301
after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed   15.659319977138196
then the thing is easy   17.82872865400405
in his convent   14.458994716705552
just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics   8.61260924568022
at three o clock came two companies of the guards one french the other swiss   1.9590643088778652
i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount   18.638675585599056
asked porthos what are they firing at now   9.887794681869773
50267m my friend said the count i have still one doubt are you weak enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings   12.168551642281136
go on my good parry unless you are tired   10.244593904268388
but as we have said d artagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty   13.139262214770653
besides if they do we can easily make an excuse   7.146085108893352
you are a man of brass replied aramis   16.9477027713816
tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one o clock in the morning   12.87599949422763
yes said monte cristo and god i can not say in justice for his justice would have slain you but god in his mercy spared your life   7.657623545299402
murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure   11.848828345475642
the abbé started   14.435329658277288
yes a fowl   11.639020000015424
it almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes   17.319571412598805
athos smiled   14.02501683073498
ah   12.461216912812038
how they must be asking where is the cardinal   18.40929077429984
well sir the rupture of a blood vessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a second   7.990011234458805
debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave   13.451759969332414
i insult you   12.122550682335467
i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage   8.600523790534712
he was a man of execution this worthy porthos   20.10161956587003
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another   13.763793520221183
you will soon be paid   10.847657101447648
in addition to this d artagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and monsieur de tréville   12.14486907719441
that letter is not lost   17.900373424294514
but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of d artagnan cruelly mystified him   23.937910254841952
then aloud are you ambitious   12.14217470101703
no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount   13.875155113241604
he smiled   15.038285643337876
do you talk in your sleep   18.748566150471085
quite a vineyard hey   12.611554899759644
who are you   1.4824519569889194
grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a chair   12.98698719460085
we are gentlemen   6.453334581792281
give grimaud time to clear away the breakfast   7.768827835203426
exactly your man   11.717827288728996
d artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen   9.324881910929124
save me   8.527316103457952
give it me that i may see it is not false   16.679096494622208
pass on before me i beg of you   12.185023842369413
and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back again   7.538169048662129
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him   16.938172383961923
could your conversation have been overheard by anyone   13.857058679308881
come come madame   8.938917154936947
besides i don t prevent you from listening but i must be gone   12.625380030396954
surely valentine you are mistaken   6.250854133557514
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal   17.06092466803036
d avrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances   8.374567555497507
there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation   13.107317354500308
take care my young friend   15.491260916690296
chapter xxviii   14.933442049589166
answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man   2.1443303418377226
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him   9.459453306613648
de tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see him   11.03604607273409
since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room   2.4616535270248683
forgive edmond forgive for my sake who love you still   7.196540648260528
poor man he is a worthy creature   13.968401600504817
athos and aramis took their leave but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the duke s cries   17.634276284030335
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here   17.216719688256838
the bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor ship owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources   12.76795630409644
and unless his near neighbor and would be friend the count of monte cristo possessed the ring of gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this time   16.053489735799655
i m not the man you take me for   12.03342621074053
when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved   2.9048138829676624
the president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm   17.188804632007795
d artagnan interpreted it   12.393211029424377
she called the maid and questioned her   1.7868861670738543
6   13.605054541740158
then pretending to see raoul for the first time ah   11.104409717195272
but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me   10.890325277252694
it seems that some days since councillor bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones from the moats round paris young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned   13.810993338758278
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said sharp   7.05397405209647
let us try what we can do then said the notary   19.114000496909327
and you replied to him with that notion   9.032578405118711
magnificent my dear fellow magnificent   4.044190334553704
dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much   16.44719441398366
and yet me you see plainly that i love you   2.8698895436374734
exclaimed the king s attorney   5.841314546282384
no but we are going to replied d artagnan pointing to grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground   12.227937439696461
and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m   12.156431943861639
captain groslow   3.9647485488336898
these notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army   11.014307173517382
de tréville entered   10.019549469577402
everything with him was multiplication or subtraction   6.136645026913259
that purse contained sixty pistoles   9.528409034143582
in the name of heaven run call   5.666454700403112
you speak charmingly said porthos   14.874880043386081
the house servants with the carbines   9.367147040555498
i hear my brother   11.036563818773125
and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there   8.203170779533504
he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory   9.043768545690916
well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required   18.728772836811324
this desperate resistance could not last long   7.54456074297663
cried the hollow voice of athos i can hear d artagnan i think   11.406167484487899
let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by it   15.417714169145487
50243m mon dieu   5.616280007120257
i call those first rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one s hand such as mines lands and funded property in such states as france austria and england provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions   11.074327164672734
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him   6.1546724246030005
de tréville looking at the clock   10.545196399396595
apropos are we to speak of your friends also athos porthos and aramis   9.045390727884548
each word fell like a dagger on morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy   5.553730003768373
yes my lord   9.305614373800868
you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect   11.327677944650313
aramis drew the letter from his pocket   6.966895887706558
very well madame   13.626286252581846
said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven   2.30438804873633
help to put me on the bed   9.098853504649776
mouston   13.475941261676619
the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution   14.922561274061184
the same evening the cardinal spoke to m   16.46434586274157
two minutes later the thunder of a horse s hoofs was heard upon the road   13.31941214992826
athos was not altogether the queen s dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again   12.468126262499702
you shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission well   11.002511904875366
mme   9.955727938800612
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside   23.85020827181998
do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us   17.44810906499343
he said what is the matter   6.441406640623914
and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan   17.274601532277998
my life is always at your service and should i lose it i should still owe you something   7.280655343160407
do you understand it now   17.125063824848535
what do you want   6.195030068568857
you must have time to recover yourself   10.322026172556734
d artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out   14.330869861324368
very well   9.586111364189778
they are sinking   11.636608388280138
thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam i have all i want   13.225069284400796
this separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded   15.247934806387732
well and then   14.096481047610494
do you wish for anything   13.059242062371526
patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn   14.012780695397637
and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generals la rochelle is impregnable except to famine   15.28121699963685
the devil   10.572452343844471
d artagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the cloak   4.597597143142906
but we must be going   13.058408575667576
tis then all settled   14.393624837425335
laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they haven t left a mouthful and two bottles of macon wine of which they haven t left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders no friend replied raoul smiling i am obliged to you but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have asked only i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good   16.829224116386506
and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness   8.769691308010323
dantès paused a moment then said this is it word for word the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper   10.005383237420144
cried buckingham   16.099724272931816
at last after renewed hesitation dantès entered the second grotto   15.92917396870745
i have made him a spy upon his wife   11.748860111110803

your majesty has given me the control of this business   15.085463972736171

every five minutes albert took out his watch   12.634335543945111
a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation   18.515106722687076
it is he   11.259522795594057
a hundred louis   8.869112142103802
i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain   9.619302863828596
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded   7.108961439422281
said the delighted bertuccio and you will find gloves in it   15.094675542159269
if you had been a man you would not have let him go from here   4.356331947537421
god pardon me   6.236958877648786
a man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me   13.169919120806252
moses the servant of god he was but a servant please to understand moses blessed with the hands   5.67916754823476
when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o the wisps that play about the marshes   8.242544808780774
sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon   7.976223470434534
she is young   13.26738927521696
certainly said andrea i shall not overtake my friend but i shall kill your horse therefore i had better stop   8.7923100312782
de tréville s spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them   12.40752514116733
an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones   2.3296761981750223
there s the landlord of the lamb and gros louis the farmer   13.090384833424542
they galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward scotland   12.975575552075368
at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse   14.296820304105829
when quite a child the little vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity   4.671642065277161
and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance   9.899115484894262
villefort ceased to contend   16.92907047182649
d artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer s pretty wife for three hours   14.354601486266134
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend   7.157628580948565
replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical   10.154335209721136
on the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench a book a parasol and a work basket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman standing close to the iron gate endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter   8.525176812478897
and you aramis are you of that opinion   11.895735146481954
what have i said   7.148407022094592
some provençal it appears   13.33356673835203
it is true between ourselves that m   12.267823872564197
my friend said morcerf with a sweet smile that is what i wish   1.0566144614091844
and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth d artagnan s confidence stopped there   9.919788175899589
he embraced juxon and pressed the hand of aramis   13.990328580130628
ah   15.135248285400497
d artagnan himself was moved by them   5.635908938856304
valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult   11.447935505442425
then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables   12.306535719460891
and who told you about it   11.650923077403352
but what makes you doubt it   7.352440831805553
the three gentlemen then shook hands lord de winter taking the rue saint honore and athos and aramis remaining together   9.478699714276308
because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor   12.403082574488991
they might be said to be of coral   22.11683603370388
danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase   12.242371484124325
what is the matter with my horse   18.765898329333535
the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters   10.519957538983643
d artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m   6.055057067975832
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage   23.043279400371265
felton i bring misfortune to all who surround me   17.464043646586532
and drew from amid his rags a hundred and fifty spanish double pistoles which he laid down on the table   17.093037617707747
a young man   16.323281068396103
a hundred pistoles   10.843706340357166
certainly   7.139170004781948
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her   13.261801137865715
how could i then return to brussels   7.988064114295535
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin   9.63554845461107
why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help   15.276242219802619
and i can even add that i have only just left his company   6.6186543173793035
eh he said negligently this money is not mine   14.61343703659205
a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature   16.06296763401054
what did i say   15.076836027722267
if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory   9.163694418453435
ah   6.920662767649313
edmond it is not madame de morcerf who is come to you it is mercédès   13.074246355757385
the eye of aramis kindled in spite of himself   15.365385331694478
yesterday evening   5.4754722515788075
oh gentlemen   8.999762527527377
follow me said the man   12.617596156215285
but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint méran despised all who were not noble   9.107830248268696
but not knowing you would come to see me i had made an engagement with a friend   10.264934575893047
diavolo   10.501252566799655
silence about the queen above all or you will ruin everybody without saving yourself   12.873164048908231
it might be imagined that he was a hundred miles from the capital   15.189800219217565
listen to me my dear girl said the gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made athos   7.366415781014723
two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides l impartial and what was more serious one that was well known as a government paper   14.628886591367294
i mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these   20.716516309942
mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the gascon began to laugh at him and said porthos would be angry my dear monsieur mousqueton but i pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gay come along   10.603538991325628
said mme   11.265507291840448
e   17.096985449658064
on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first   10.648906570522431
he opened his eyes upon utter darkness   16.155579815631388
well now what do you say to a cart   9.217426432596358
the cardinal referred to that man whom d artagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor broussel   16.526089957678316
have you a heart   7.187479012463102
the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance   5.166426123255939
the glance was of sublime eloquence   13.712665925109544
and then i also wish to see a notary that i may be assured that all our property returns to valentine   0.7688960875001634
and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel   13.428882043945338
and of what woman are you speaking thus   2.0923309925580664
that someone has done society a great kindness   19.505174950502788
i regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each other   12.873329297779271
after having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his souvenirs auteuil rue de la fontaine no   15.871942499039342
war for the king   8.004666204997843
the mountaineers are bonapartists sire   5.507332676754545
this sight reassured him   10.906575118860342
bartholomew in 1572   15.587282369335869
what was most clear in the matter was that d artagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all   12.101827254488335
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore   5.6762843833756556
in that case replied franz as i shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please   11.106756427139826
for one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect he threw himself on his father s neck   15.135773251231626
a child who will be of age in four years   7.263223796751591
his head becomes weaker   12.850442040705378
a light appeared under the door   4.442514910808078
it is that your majesty will make him come here will interrogate him yourself tête à tête without witnesses and that i shall see your majesty as soon as you have seen the duke   9.041557473856027
all right said athos   22.08181150730229
the count was thoughtful and silent   15.884178793163176
come continued athos executioner do your duty   6.261724248674272
come in come in monsieur porthos   8.90143308302071
ah monsieur you may take my word when i tell you anything   15.583727825393138
asked the young man   12.220862694380322
an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation   14.190972634475195
and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the evening   10.970214981667876
what news   6.57828499629013
well said monte cristo you are fortunate m   10.883003832059657
the horse was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace   8.36909848598901
faria bent on him his penetrating eye   16.9237842923382
and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart   12.569322919558983
he appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort   13.123734857950211
m   6.9119633960931
but never mind   9.369838481550325
only grazed a little replied d artagnan   20.25076615733337
madame you are deceived said porthos   13.91071388244283
i shall take better care of them myself answered d artagnan   16.47108068131688
danglars and tell him that my mother and myself must leave paris tomorrow   18.07684450913378
for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets   9.345169815654478
cried the host   9.414956862197114
that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes   7.220156626039835
the coachman as we can well understand made no resistance   10.67213833492525
and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father   13.972943308075084
ere long marseilles presented herself to view marseilles white fervid full of life and energy marseilles the younger sister of tyre and carthage the successor to them in the empire of the mediterranean marseilles old yet always young   15.302855989010459
now sire resumed aramis listen to me   12.576247047188637
and he had five millions in your hands alone   8.314162323846713
ah now i think of it the count of monte cristo can not appear in the hall said beauchamp   10.48340590185007
de villefort made and returned very few visits   4.340502401174872
the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier   15.174063947287221
from an apoplectic stroke   6.84323538356039
do you not guess monsieur   20.12556861740648
sir   19.643674351744938
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away   11.336605970401907
for the last hour i have not heard him stir   9.747249166437722
the one that is most in use just at this time   13.169789521991131
the abbé told me it was worth 50 000 francs muttered caderousse   11.487656872256368
but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son   7.004062506782633
go cornélie said madame danglars i do not require you any longer   7.880735456303424
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness   3.300225655840995
yes   6.222856867498017
around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach   11.598255473550932
so he cherishes no resentment   13.998835365775363
at nine o clock madame la première présidente arrived   17.577219173634866
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin   11.165552742557251
short or tall   20.29111316427761
you know resumed d artagnan that she has had leave to return to france   7.3799520527248
well let us pledge the ring but upon one condition   6.640336862519167
there it is my lord said the young man   2.7132691468773444
sign my lord   15.945972585899877
at what time   9.716156072840455
but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself   15.79994343354143
his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip   14.234194913338197
and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks   17.274811296419887
yes signed the old man   15.99721550567026
the queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what i suffer   14.803728881981044
means for classical tragedy after a moment of silence employed by milady in observing the young man who listened to her milady continued her recital   12.637719539307286
we have said that athos loved d artagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man   21.844797687687638
in losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from olivain the emotion his face might betray   11.937794948524138
at the moment when the hand of the massive time piece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door   10.47228391986194
but said porthos i think i have an idea in my turn   10.296565790504825
but as she left the apartment julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features   13.803500906412792
there   19.040780391570316
yes you know the amount   13.581757159720441
by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon   16.496363433045307
raoul said athos   6.3736903531051565
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort   7.673914489927513
that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders for god s sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve   10.779288656479851
to answer you would be to forget it   17.780658850368837
no   11.636009935242583
what an idea   14.978320328082761
you should have left it to me then madame who know what they are   5.887331548497182
he has killed the executioner of bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged   17.869328835713887
i will manage the master   11.657787145485946
yes sire in solitary confinement in a dungeon like the lowest criminal   11.1055616337055
i take that god to witness at whose feet i have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years that i would have sacrificed my life to you and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it   18.029370121671654
replied d artagnan   16.593646872892506
stop there   13.212019406450398
charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn   11.551999806609171
everybody pities you sir   13.766324991714301
they separated and d artagnan rushed between them like a dart   13.091736626081646
he saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance   16.97380721681142
everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we choose   16.10073592855614
even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to pass   11.932081857882254
f   8.77023484857122
he must have one said athos   13.642957196163415
inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place royale   18.00384769198131
then when they had disappeared he said with a smile tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion   10.286048259964256
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits   13.997320408298872
it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo   14.243482667171437
40252m that is quite my opinion said the gentleman   17.520550551066236
and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated   8.880371941252502
the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed and which indeed have survived them of the procurators of the period meanness stinginess fasts   15.19844052610457
i inherit my father s name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it   19.530942790102703
and teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waist girdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain   14.896183385321514
the house of thomson french had 300 000 or 400 000 francs to pay this month in france   13.059748256954505
mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please   21.729614514696024
it is the same thing   15.405265648788326
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere   12.061391567126854
yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room   14.121764019529568
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all   15.01230019212609
my grandfather intends leaving this house said she and barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another   20.03752778903037
athos smiled   9.735830801140839
my lord said raoul blushing might examine the spanish prisoner   7.356217188119127
de monte cristo has just carried off their five millions   19.62652287090795
imprisonment menaces ill treatment she has suffered everything   15.048698953306587
not at all   16.901374979173863
it became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of calvinism a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling   21.594531924778714
quite quite alone replied the man or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing   14.308152618908828
oh i am dying   9.80080969718471
holloa   17.564768563046552
for about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife with two servants a chambermaid named trinette and a hostler called pecaud   14.23927714822249
milady   13.248587860574322
well said renée i can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician for instance   12.765862809655045
she corrupted this man   7.655511891526881
three or four times he started up imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing him   12.816223788518224
was andrea s first thought   12.291370577573703
what are you saying   15.946171025606239
surely you must be mistaken   19.438123792197423
my father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from heaven   19.219970088500133
let me reflect a little   19.52300329505027
ah yes   9.905655595568653
do you authorize mademoiselle valentine to intrust herself to my honor   14.15098698010285
said porthos protruding his lips with contempt   10.271250741926837
he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa as nessus the centaur carried deianira   18.08980484114926
what you say is full of sense replied d artagnan   18.149053039169665
her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion   13.87016155284448
for from this moment you are free as the air   7.731953394318047
hold your tongue you stupid fellow   13.363891406615048
and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed   8.213398704573414
you are wrong my lord   6.023865688399082
to let me sail first   5.867318644755444
i felt sure it must be you   15.096048216898923
faria followed him with an excited look   12.830102502721031
but afterwards   11.337854312276658
my lord replied the messenger i wish to speak to your eminence in secret   15.888070671999873
before we are alarmed we see correctly   13.684873490011514
it was arthur   5.565114862119248
five months after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercédès arms   17.847319704455447
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her   22.083545063490536
and who is the person whom you suspect   9.091978385377969
then he added aloud did he make any resistance   9.889229005753663
this morning i awoke at six o clock   8.612028258637576
without a blush men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing   10.303164668717718
cried the duke opening the door of the chapel patrick   9.95296857621226
i have extricated you from misery felton   9.725335820477321
we will fight nevertheless   11.375258944433154
toward paris   15.032873755488646
something better still mouston   15.245976019420512
those studs which the king speaks of you gave them to the duke of buckingham did you not   13.205937195171245
i will listen   18.45298499143412
stop   7.804219905913659
as d artagnan had foreseen athos was not within   11.110554477911606
i only wish he would let me take his place   7.069912398964206
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups   6.313521405196046
yes   13.765568560354364
the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated   4.060712021111058
speak as fully as you please sir said the king who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in blacas s face and affected villefort s voice   11.320197279763633
and since i found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate to be close to you without really seeing you have i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength   4.8703607624293594
milady gave him her hand to kiss   13.976024710513148
and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk   14.285936539064892
i did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir   15.975397435282375
no replied morrel   12.205094526101472
fine vengeance that on my faith   12.100866295788228
this track soon disappeared   15.451082455975301
the baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young officer   12.003362946782113
look you my friends   13.470713364348594
she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it   6.983385166956159
morrel could not resist this   10.000337086101135
because i scarcely know why but it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it   11.218837140616166
faugh   10.153287114647473
here they separated and bidding adieu to guitant in the court of the palais royal mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure   12.452216184937782
but the convent where is that   14.620678140843562
no   3.831819274333254
the abbé opened his mouth hesitated for a moment then making an effort at self control he said and mercédès they tell me that she has disappeared   17.38101772633906
well   12.137121220163706
and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully   12.280879824965474
for three months i watched m   19.549187420010146
valentine blushed but did not answer   4.637131315739957
it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint méran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300 000 livres   10.5714992068702
yes sir replied morcerf   10.535811715182243
20129m well my dear albert said franz turning towards his friend   9.58495469305859
then i saw no more   9.030272699407021
at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape   12.79034785584342
she is capable of anything or everything   7.468776215350135
and signed by whom by the king   10.646028945315821
yes that is true said she and i will confess to your majesty that my husband your husband has none   14.732231192960626
you mean monsieur zaccone i presume   5.802557559788535
faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity   15.988776658170108
but this i know you have some motive of personal hatred against dantès for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others   11.83112878759399
marie michon was a very aristocratic person   11.983578834621317
tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold colored silk embroidered with pearls   7.44068499596023
i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis   10.239717780239959
tomorrow then sire   9.779585210818906
confidence and love made him a giant   11.402378404951106
how pale you look   17.625593789519677
so then   15.220337227590335
we are almost there and i want no one to see me getting out of your carriage   7.46802364789757
add another day for landing and that would make four   13.585475292924144
on his wife s request m   9.615799574905758
from time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer   8.877879198558215
cried porthos   12.45444605363948
laporte pointed to the child who was asleep   10.396609472331068
shall i leave you   14.505716884940629
said the young man in an almost joyful accent pressing monte cristo s hand with both his own   16.312386634439086
i am dying with curiosity and uneasiness   11.901463391538153
excellency returned bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count s laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience   17.664671381442602
i should be delighted to do so was the reply   14.587372259162787
now on taking prisoners this morning two frenchmen who seemed to me of high birth in short two knights of the garter i said to myself my fortune is made   15.967589865821642
a woman accompanied by a servant   12.995072363194941
instantly a mask wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance   19.307114489518284
f   9.852740442282913
as for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite   12.249421886971716
keep that ring for love of me   14.475965194534286
do i know   10.526599368860271
continued caderousse half rising and with his fist on the table hallo edmond   15.245502858610163
i ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants   11.015674206065775
the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment   7.6014621355595
d avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away   5.893846697059316
grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands   10.264760484648454
that s well said the cardinal   13.646404750759542
quick quick   11.74393969330097
we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the count of monte cristo   13.164529342087127
groslow whistled and a sailor appeared   9.344838777717957
said peppino   11.3333666137607
you will be a brave and adventurous captain   13.256466627555522
edmond hoped he was dying   8.016144889514687
and lord de winter do you know anything about him   16.224549770590716
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the manager of the project gutenberg™ trademark   8.766828749306248
mazarin is almost king answered athos   15.38115555376468
0189m dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall   9.001119970039262
asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain   12.611889654234993
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee   13.876071796061403
and he appeared to meditate   18.461879446556164
luckily the man i had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so i took advantage of his silence to walk off   8.104960976132157
porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible   7.6993634414370975
the visitor was about fifty two years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe   16.27694841253418
your declaration   9.23293217308199
ah   11.589935322084274
with whom   10.631003806902031
my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal   16.784294051550948
i draw upon him for 600 000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400 000 francs payable at his correspondent s in paris at the end of this month   6.967748080212831
i called you because you were running like a madman and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said caderousse laughing   14.456525655019163
asked the countess   10.273309150331526
but at night   12.40079187704752
athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword   18.26260518519425
i have no objection to that said aramis from whom the letter and the gold had removed as by magic his ideas of conversion   13.853222871934282
he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be going   13.403670033761719
mm   15.092415597081551
if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair   12.699508707251832
an opportunity will come replied rochefort   11.469527985500209
well then listen valentine said the count   10.835467429561191
m   5.1727655948265285
was not your father a bonapartist   6.367223374481867
what do you hope   16.563263181461295
little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day   14.88106103550174
adieu madame adieu   6.734789459539887
demanded d artagnan   9.376693878823062
valentine uttered a cry   18.22270934857036
the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me   14.025166197912172
he will sully it then returned lucien   7.0694017794075386
a secondary cause but not the principal   6.233484969684012
said lord de winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of milady   9.394890084677115
no father stammered villefort   9.587286607853779
oh it must not be called suffering   24.701641309276276
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered   12.00586275923014
it is the poniard   10.73616766218671
then you have no religion at all   8.052584030320912
capital   5.623337825721463
i was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where i have been concealed between two mattresses   17.449774383947315
said athos   14.285559675592747
the marquis of saint méran   8.722396013166572
then perhaps it is to your son m   19.792050631376537
and the greek princess will she be here   13.598832152914389
stop in the name of heaven monsieur porthos   8.447585181706119
you would arrest the duc de beaufort armed in the field   14.750382165977141
he alone could have transmitted to lord de winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of fatalities   10.031484759058655
i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus   12.030148742176177
asked the president   12.395123403031622
i predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs   11.114403556034029
monsieur d arminges and olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse   15.171355347943262
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power   9.740764315601838
your mother has no longer either throne or husband   12.705971436999686
the valet went out of the room this time by the centre door but still as silently as before   4.834094198186507
oh merciful heavens was i not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility by my contempt for him not remembering or not willing to remember that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer   11.911359099799556
i detest her from antipathy   9.971457754934908
but strongly recommends m   11.531953156903393
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight   8.856976924906004
oh i assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three   12.779096738585576
it was not uncommon for richelieu and louis xiii   12.594979056031866
never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself   9.993017927350081
we must understand each other said the duke   14.237051144297318
no one has seen him   5.608859980752233
now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest   10.890110951340683
what to do   11.3282730319841
but inquired dantès hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves   12.885754252347484
they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber   18.502963537341913
what do you wish for   13.91672307360323
well then did he ask you who is m   12.200244068050255
hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face   14.069103955372217
i have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer   8.913716426120978
can it be   9.749254048435535
oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead   8.137286098222098
if there are three let yourself be slain but save the king   6.744682834527125
ah said the count watching andrea s countenance i do not demand any confession from you   17.75978563070327
sire murmured lord leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity   8.886828929967002
so at least the duke believed   8.00546770956294
chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its weight   7.489566961217382
asked morrel   21.734060363400154
he only barks he never bites   9.89074674018266
she is not his wife yet as it seems to me   13.643668450289757
i agree with m   12.458511411017959
mademoiselle cried valentine   11.560623038377937
then steer for monte cristo   9.352490651511474
to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow   10.437115960572093
the cardinal s house had no secrets for me   5.934662268896072
keep your journey a secret   9.343051243466213
it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened   12.16177221233376
besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather large   15.558657237515938

d artagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority   6.454879638259711
this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours   18.32641205540519
i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his breast   14.61286978092229
yes   5.087643096938667

aramis look at that horse   13.993765007371138
the one i mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by accident   14.060014252106594
mousqueton s horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his companions   9.946203596791177
and then james ii   12.584065615352598
a woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her   11.463704987413646
and by my troth i shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure   14.7382457129711
what queen a servant more ardent   14.107236244392654
tranquil yes replied cromwell   11.497521486374659
if it were bad money there might be some hopes   6.209913455384482
we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk   2.6547631234645515
oh no answered franz i had no such intention   15.040817292771136
said the king   8.905737652190478

scoundrel infamous scoundrel   13.18359284636098
the cousin was received with resignation that was all   11.67164245169745
the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of richelieu the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austria to declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal   12.560414819521721
count he said i swear to you my soul is no longer my own   13.454520655153392

more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard   17.499759773963085

albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair   17.82317516731303
how   8.274960072206804
he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery   9.878978689049113
at the hotel de ville   15.435456314591114
for the king s service we need horses   12.938218559191128
upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador   8.556897613458592
what is it   7.6507120580024806
true   8.61957807824875
the timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman   8.080234729924424
you have some plan then   10.741437716619679
i came to pray over the body of your daughter   8.886513787808596

duchâtel or from m   11.711185593752552
come said d artagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where athos is   4.869527137415041
asked he   11.899720260765635
well am i to rush into his arms and strain him to my heart crying my father my father   18.166412334561834
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness   19.067143909912353
pardieu   8.821333228515757
it had long been an object of ambition for porthos   12.653692692689344
morrel did not turn round he expected these words of cocles the agent of thomson french   18.55716317746813
but when after they had all got in it came to his turn there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel   13.34194074690466
before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in   11.768178334787663
augustine which he was forced to write in latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good deal   19.170866409277153
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface   8.248786042924007
ah   9.344555501405074
if i find you alive on my return you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie   15.452830891110883
one however fell at the duke s feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket   14.816633833582518
the servant announced the young man   14.25737569771827

look   20.410276035836162
and then to be here so young   8.943295803829006
and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor   15.495655482501661
what is the matter   9.341185028355564
only a letter all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters had come for aramis   9.644309248767778
ah believe me edmond as i told you i too have suffered much   10.149461127878286
would not one say he was speaking of a religious community   8.555526742184842
yes   15.631464578518228
ah said andrea who knows   8.389338035229624
see said d avrigny to villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow   14.482260640790189
but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantès return on a mission of vengeance   18.266381586556573
you are very generous gentlemen of the guards said athos full of rancor for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day   10.13082737121501
and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond and offered him his hand   21.530266675235303
we must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant manner   6.412810733776806
yes   11.553214330842307
count for yourself   11.39111986537373
well then if we can get athos all will be well   15.380685839991743
i am quite ready said d artagnan   7.236156536551578
then she sobbed aloud   18.853596277338823
and we shall answer   13.691280103053742
warn him as i have warned you   17.153068241806487

cloud and not elsewhere before the d estrées s pavilion and not in another street   14.714131532615351
upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the duke s arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust   16.33472204947958
but instead of listening m   9.326627936086805
i feel my head a little confused   6.517068466545615
oh i confess it is all the same to me   13.178328370663037
why sir a man of about fifty   11.11384521892243

it is this i swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the 5th of february 1815 between nine and ten o clock in the evening   12.117042552311784
they all asked   13.096837728078512
every one likes his own uniform best my lord   13.748830645545773
the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his eminence   6.8217798912820715
touch me not   20.508696959511795
wait then monsieur wait said the king   7.555629409885348
well this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house   8.003445684106012
it does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which athos had started it does not signify gentlemen   15.683532989422329
cried m   8.493128626669904
i don t know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you are speaking my lord   13.769816093182785
on the sixth day the smugglers returned   4.334852995319571
another whom he recognized as the one who had cried out courage   8.773684184709555
to fall continued king louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended to fall and learn of that fall by telegraph   3.6276648915712073
the abbé scarron   10.941132924395463
a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him   8.862940909240956
the king was already sanguine but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to joy   24.56817354216448
the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it   20.598651400294283
there has been a misunderstanding   9.727294143598687
en route gentlemen   6.626904930547388
now as d artagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his   8.448760085426544
then d artagnan became almost wild   7.429100937983936
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand   16.737237275481966
and to sign the contract in three days   9.846749435625942
i will   14.134191101729797
but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of athos   11.748523611355518
hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort   13.384947859645507
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly   14.167846031419115
cried d artagnan not in the least   16.53702863744524
listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy   11.182739368087397
but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will be   12.42621460710982
the moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light   17.20013058294066
we shall have occasion i warn you at some future period to speak of that   12.121606157533932
they had arrived in the champs élysées   14.324094940059432
this   13.798098613823248
but after a moment s silence he continued the president went up the steps after pushing his sword into his cane   10.224664426588047
and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing   7.342617885215346
making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than napoleon did of his battle fields with his sword and his victories   14.675222717936357
they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers and here they are   10.541115766332544
violence he said to himself would spoil all   9.87221175003996
my apartment will be close to his   19.626857982649657
the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself   10.044188723481081
they are friends   12.022624153647767
give your orders and we will execute them   13.733741655284927
and wherefore has he not been to see me   9.536085543477217
as to aramis he never played   12.23733587815394
he took his army to the priest s where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornet s who performed wonders   21.307710185774738
i was giddy that is all   8.706406944195841

be good enough to open to me for i wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet him   15.991435456445409
yes answered monte cristo happily yes conscience does remain   8.67577490017012
the cicerone reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coachman   16.19316169814679
i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own   13.810744509799532
he persists in remaining there   6.799951273037257
oh   12.505327326755594
it is well   10.577720846660268
wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed albert stepped back and morrel closed the door   6.8936282506003765
said d artagnan raising the battered hat   4.266026989851561
i desire but one thing in this world edmond the happiness of my son   17.600894834490802
i asked you continued villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my father in law m   20.022122665119607
with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet   13.659742061974168
because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery   11.615033175574712
i will suppose anything you please   8.820073744100867
guided by valentine he had learned how to understand the old man quickly   9.5834761048295
and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our holy father the pope   8.74213609868373
yes the enemy   12.262290473330347
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled   14.113964267883322
that s the reason why i take such care you shall not deprive me of mine   18.85548964190148
once beyond saint denis we shall have nothing to fear   17.973697858980298
caderousse s plans alarmed andrea still more than his ideas   3.755229658288572
then it is understood said d artagnan   5.8192535525758595
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and one nights   11.360653860803216
i have already told you avenge him   9.73231970779531
the son has been educated in a college in the south   10.882985350726628
but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter   16.6099702849633
i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste   9.274995220959582
he returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed   14.070984961561976
but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed   8.104711406078787

ah   12.371190821786795
at eleven o clock kitty came to him   13.779762426018749
the president requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that she was dressed in the grecian costume and was remarkably beautiful   8.271405325564533
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory   6.647047794070998
i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance   5.044914928402858
bazin who looked at his master without comprehending the cause of this change in a melancholy manner allowed the omelet to slip into the spinach and the spinach onto the floor   16.296685304863693

in fact porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful lungs   6.963008065754521
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption   9.950138899071353

but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality   13.365406601702876
yes your majesty he answered trembling   17.62616910807416
his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty s favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for ourselves   21.820063442628133

we stepped into the boat   10.657455034697893
it looked a race of phantoms   16.969553499323467

nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise   4.166982952339042
calm yourself dear rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen again   11.207392529372529

i want you to be approved   12.358049613705816
as if there was not another house at auteuil than that of the assassination   14.51198369668146

the king went straight to him   3.8979104574889814
listen you know if i may be relied on   15.76049272677809
it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franz s host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges   18.41324270863643
kitty   12.816351826885585
the queen full of energy and courage was quickly alive to these two virtues in others   6.05255765724033

mesdemoiselles noblet julia and leroux executed the customary pirouettes   17.7829121091403
to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beauty it was too much for a visionary   13.29709664883665
what a horrible scene   12.689490949903876
cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still harping on that terrible idea   15.869885320969118
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended   14.440176667584268

i am too good natured   13.74719543905073
and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan   15.448327878024049
the three millions are probably on the road   11.703850769255943
he is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse   11.309880690294992
i am a frondist from my heart   16.87531169152349
the chancellor made a profound reverence   9.061456661812802

locusta and agrippina living at the same time were an exception and proved the determination of providence to effect the entire ruin of the roman empire sullied by so many crimes   8.94258990414234
no i am lost   16.86531638108043
that is my opinion said aramis   13.15059867521473
cried the queen on perceiving the two friends you have come faithful friends   8.886382579132553
athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder   12.306320055041473
think of that valentine   8.316670584237826
she gave it to me herself   15.989477894405885
have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met   7.50849338345707
still ali thanks to his wild nature and the count thanks doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees   8.782055377600605
no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening   4.092777537870617
will you let me be killed   18.263886257077658
upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes   13.091733701218748
d artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation   9.094025914179516
the shade of cardinal richelieu   12.952118930874125

at this last thought mercédès burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony   6.740533326189352
said he but help me to die if you can   19.515041996662493
and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans   19.414317122315765
pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their caves   15.030172145406361
then all three windows will have yellow draperies   12.982561341821933

what mean you by that   3.2577895120578155
yes indeed to you   11.730624270014195
when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him   11.464596569108537
besides you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort   14.187279951737995

die impenitent die in despair die and be damned   18.57315973843283
you are very good madame but m   8.331184340166715

your highness s most devoted servant in the bastile as elsewhere comte de rochefort   11.620254352984125
they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly   16.161777832507646
inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these words from lord ruthven to countess g   9.143684513987989
but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening   9.842634686563759
and you sire prevent me from sleeping with your security   11.584702370747458
and this carte blanche said d artagnan this carte blanche does it remain in her hands   13.591536361362602
but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage   9.164784815639816
coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to porthos and mme   13.417949257395318
they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was roasting   18.00763141350614
d artagnan   11.894896051071763
yes yes continued m   4.874295434553375
but i love her my lord and was jealous   10.598475452820738

the table at which the puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention harrison sat with his back to the king   9.771014832319784
luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you   10.81139871208205
gutenberg   6.7095733552065715
mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing   12.323153673994534
these devote their blood those their nightly labors to the same cause   16.838262704277206
he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy   15.357034794890598
inquired d artagnan   12.83263781123057
you have several lawsuits and no attorney   14.309465212091837
d artagnan d artagnan   15.762856020318011
madame danglars was chatting at a short distance with debray beauchamp and château renaud   7.778641134062335
he reflected smiled and replied to me by a sicilian proverb which i believe is also a french proverb my son the world was not made in a day but in seven   7.457156626426889
in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where d artagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where athos was to be   12.069244332358572
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given   3.4854298574581772
i repeat it d artagnan you are the best one among us   12.925591273900318
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving d artagnan s composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands   7.255768679997698
i can show you answered the gascon   18.105849423034
milady and rochefort exchanged a smile and separated   19.193157956326992
i shall pass all my life thought d artagnan in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot   14.038126552360112
she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow   17.460927632883692
louis de bourbon prince de condé who since the death of his father henri de bourbon was called in accordance with the custom of that period monsieur le prince was a young man not more than twenty six or twenty seven years old with the eye of an eagle agl occhi grifani as dante says aquiline nose long waving hair of medium height well formed possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldier that is to say the rapid glance quick decision fabulous courage   8.218266346014365
he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain   13.353413548494768
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges   13.551679477596643
the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting   19.24715985114268
excuse me said d artagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry   11.193122946880903
whilst mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to paralyze his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer   9.50525453173085
although about forty four or forty five years old she might have passed for thirty five   20.439611327467873
i like order in everything   14.181385784832097
yes said morrel it is true   11.46926646975561
d artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use   18.354149782975227
to that exclamation of porthos s succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door   10.829326515385082
listen replied felton in a low voice   17.279197451260387
no sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious   17.88652182979386
i congratulate you my dear m   11.134321221153508
to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at père pamphile s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding   9.40236906574727
monsieur de morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made   9.541057021849504
the king looked towards him   19.06334132888862
20183m the beautiful greek of yesterday   13.96200794825025
under your auspices i will receive any person you please but you must not expect me to be too confiding   20.304979866029445
i will make him suffer   11.560119736739615

as m   12.781085424641049
on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin   13.534792897579447
if your majesty wishes to look out well then look   13.645481196548742
you then love haydée   18.20762533733037
thank god you have come   15.272671377159206
really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage   9.817510320386276
but how can that be   14.398072037921649
let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by to morrow we shall have quite a powerful army   16.823619618176018
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy   7.556814953134082
i can still say it is a dream   16.495965765798587
thanks monsieur returned monte cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre   10.076628071215085
so if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first oh   7.214403545856448
the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in paris   3.025533887497714
he bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy louis xiv   7.264375403892599
the devil   6.717036361343349
why   5.133746402413381
replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum   8.830937148156982
this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was   11.47937318254834
he will become so monsieur   14.232701839886273
at what   12.587616697878959
perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so violently   11.874355118777709
for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents of which i have been the victim have deprived me   14.448103407433237
the child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said i swear to your majesty   12.07160294159053
ah cowards   13.006999390219791
but i forgot added the gascon smiling pardon i forgot you are no longer athos   7.449669227398539
and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so   5.586936027670616
the juncture was favorable   20.677814823238812
and why   6.370341351940409
something which will surprise you   12.153809654767576
they were numerous and inauspicious   15.47167507906821
sir replied raoul putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count i owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me   7.082289965857517
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold   17.400441270409324
let us hasten up   16.292913402872625
no you are a physician   20.404956868025096
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected   8.0254630122143
de villefort   13.957649606005562
a sob was the only sound he heard   13.987440725061164
are you hurt sir   8.810896671217678
in vain were i an ambitious man should i struggle against such remembrances as he has left   17.364153632649035
50281m morrel opened the letter and read my dear maximilian there is a felucca for you at anchor   10.258326969211584
you were rich noble held in great esteem had all that could render a man happy   12.138496089391758
yes said the old man   7.975563529168916
it was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the rhône but the care according to the boy s account that they took to avoid being seen   14.617932138362585
a bad plan   8.643925063532444
but this time the terrible brother in law of milady did not content himself as on the preceding day with passing before the door and going away again   11.093169022530427
e   11.88810156577798
i am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine animals   18.45333961938109
at a quarter to six o clock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace   9.153254427083603
but he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second than for fear he should make a third he is struck down   9.274478668957105
impossible   12.908392562081634
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist   12.95587487308707
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks   8.716464531905677
you are mistaken   12.088234494642096
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought   18.038471225472183
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying   12.610718342230868
this time i have merely come from cadiz   12.529881048513474
on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle   9.80654142781134
death is depicted on his face   10.352361848554358
well monsieur he is still here   13.03196147967416
it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way   20.717722087592072
the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in heart free in mind into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie   16.69176624417345
would you like to become rich or at least independent   15.959389597468487
and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy   17.497016775626836
could you let me hire a horse of you   11.405804864935256

and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you   4.465384921858312
well ali my nubian believes me to be an arab   10.02595276418613
oh very well replied aramis   6.89665058182784
and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address   13.551759518095194
whose name is danglars   13.46742905489685
but i am firm   5.244503482708174
d artagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying   7.8366367945093085
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at d artagnan hatefully   6.637363511060737
he will never guess what all this means   9.352905786747478
the prisoner did not wish to lose time   7.9739735580797655
his name   14.800564072786452
in italy   14.739813835605318
but his father a sun pluribus impar left his personal splendor to each of his favorites his individual value to each of his courtiers   11.41176158186876
ejaculated the priest   8.995579920269288
but after his bath   8.030880985503702
ah indeed   16.942793365475186
ah reverend sir cried caderousse clasping his hands and drawing nearer to monte cristo i may indeed say you are my deliverer   18.632444182639638
some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the musketeers that the burial would take place at midday   9.677230345223295
he will very probably come of his own accord said morcerf   12.688363115701444
but i fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first   17.72899782390398
every one according to his nature my dear d artagnan   10.124527208438213
i did hope man is a poor wretched creature i did hope   12.846504089448725
d artagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeer s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it   10.047991513109196
we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man   16.35539641899887
i alone am to blame for the indiscretion   10.116221630063475
no one answered   16.86175735211727
well i went to a horse dealer s where i saw this magnificent horse which i have named médéah   17.337065828940716
danglars that you are asking so many questions   17.054327326264428
said the man   15.004047809902133
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me   17.995190561234992
ah true i was writing   10.76598852627843
then he turned to the officer   14.382570082252064
lucien debray   8.391927555115995
the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo   10.836353933650477
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honoré   15.776559218920951
as i am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed i went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it   4.977384567916043
it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love   12.05454154220939
oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with weakness   9.912412362329784
sir you know well i would risk my life for you   16.22925285482959
better than ever   8.942225879330298
in fact as we have said the whole camp was in motion   6.402669366614549
but that relatively to all i have learned you have yet a great deal to learn   10.730234639987083
and m   14.962749796377079
4 beheaded   7.774101918985444
did i say dead or alive   8.445882118162158
oh yes yes i do sir   15.255013796818405
how could that be monsieur   14.551448152807302
the court of his hôtel situated in the rue du vieux colombier resembled a camp from by six o clock in the morning in summer and eight o clock in winter   16.57595969767547
at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d avrigny and morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in grief   18.120325954210095
marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity   17.520018741755617
yes tis too true said comminges tis almost a prison   6.713461622549694
by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive   12.929329204502565
the generation who follow us are very precocious   6.827588688737093
after a long talk with the harbor master captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind   10.29651073352878
but really no matter go on   10.44031061971721
thanks father thanks   16.622875109311668
without doubt   7.964937402028083
oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies   11.702148450262293
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family   8.927643468622092
d artagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame   16.91425845418901
i ask no better said aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself   16.090565814902845
and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son   19.281962188319334
what do you mean sir   10.665372263637554
the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motionless   13.653708101850931
as soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be weighed   5.602340516036192
certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land   17.222415853841838
you told me so just now   9.434286869933349
he glanced mechanically towards the piazza the scene was wholly changed   18.833455143083143
maximilian you are no ordinary man   16.560252514527363
good replied aramis calmly   10.89752824491037
asked porthos   11.931824809774684
great god   5.625142631854314
good day to you   4.78836512216747
for shame   11.793826330128182
as i look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio   16.140170371864944
preceded by ali who carried a rose colored flambeau in his hand the young lady who was no other than the lovely greek who had been monte cristo s companion in italy was conducted to her apartments while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself   17.269693115020925
always cautious planchet   15.967856823762276
is it mazarin s proximity that makes you so prudent   14.294100189984544
and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume   9.00806918901758
i understand said porthos   8.212969700122438
mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help said d avrigny since she is dead   16.800432474140734
but tell the duke himself who can not find anything what the report contains give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet   6.191926072188079
he causes a disturbance in your hostelry which respectable people can not put up with   16.643999313107237
he had tried his strength to the utmost   10.350633465167597
the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf   15.328657777357506
besides it will not be for long   6.777986981544212
edward edward   17.105714772175425
a moment later the gray headed man was beside him   9.432247704210695
of which he is the brightest ornament said beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne   9.074137102164622
but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility   11.681737984602378
but i will repair that wrong upon my word of honor   13.34489684877902
my dear porthos   11.043394378469696
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor   6.874191687209922
did you know her   17.45921733068318
your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak   17.82415137356605
d artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him   11.34870437742758
oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected   7.6295889532190895
this illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjects fallen from her high estate   11.430276508267035
oh yes monsieur raoul   13.763022293462058
you have already given me that reason and i find it excellent   17.72641063278039
he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality   8.780501040391512
ah   12.437194635832457
he found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughter s grave   19.63850850555111
the duke looked furiously at grimaud   7.913312964175672
that of d artagnan hope   16.610950794063058
then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty   16.164853008339854
but at the same time i perceive it would be overwhelming for me   8.702690281833156
he entered by the faubourg st   18.019295195190562
in that case i shall expect m   9.845160365955426
three days ago   8.471654608873404
continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity monseigneur replied milady a fair exchange   9.73464999735099
he called me by this name when he was in good humor   11.94778409876719
but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eugénie   10.067691246926525
you shall soon have something to drink   11.686996339903303
each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments   4.900521651512285
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived   9.903131030654496
but now we are alone what are you going to say   11.250085164493402
said d artagnan   16.133606691110078
and whenever we find each other in whatever place it may be said kitty you will find me loving you as i love you today   7.946973707491153
d artagnan knew his part well   13.631101613166793
i will take him to his cell   9.453962491406484
bazin   13.279265438139157
yes said valentine i will now acknowledge you are right maximilian   19.366406821731893
does that astonish you   13.014296587737208
mistrust everything in short even your own shadow   12.536051263496052
de villefort cried the president do you yield to an hallucination   6.688233248797281
but i where shall i go meanwhile   15.618513678237417
and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally   17.62078799809302
adieu   9.738318406997323
charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize him   11.206731161568506
but d artagnan made use of the comte de la fere s name and after paying a visit to madame de chevreuse raoul started to rejoin the army   15.077654174403849
finally i call those third rate fortunes which are composed of a fluctuating capital dependent upon the will of others or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes such as banks speculations of the day in fact all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions   16.529500056532708
on perceiving the cavaliers d artagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh   19.30245827766399
all eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious attention   15.345603936921844
but before six months you with your music and i with my voice we shall double our capital   18.633103196552295
i do not know only he has followed your grace from the palais royal stopped at the louvre to wait for you and now leaves the louvre with you   14.311152059160001
i hope you have a sword at home   11.020615624669624
to questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be given   4.8551531505854255
asked valentine   9.474365191189635
and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony   11.58601266923834
from pure zeal   7.647534164002636
and had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment   10.233042605288873
danglars signature chapter 105   9.186104440708728
unhappy man you named no one i hope   9.828174439814786
the men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported them   12.747334495541475
immediately   9.135733251957618
40112m when did you first feel that   14.32724755808545
oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit fathers   8.755571542386104
mordaunt he cried   7.544995711867379
the queen is so good   8.244719590687858
do not be uneasy said mazarin   5.181029829106027
but first give me this letter   8.930028507392604
the procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m   12.836122585623835
your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is   8.925961134819286
all i can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that providence   14.087480660396832
the fourth as we have said was dead   11.164419605730673
cried albert   9.500066838623606
we were working at saint mandrier near toulon   17.119428802340913
when are you to pay   14.666035035855359
2 2 600 000 in 1894   10.529282993883102
asked mazarin   14.143037138171728
i must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till i see you again   4.822934265968575
how can i tell you   9.381952932646685
and what do they say of it in the world   8.12363793696391
aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder   12.068059555556006
joannes in the palais royal arcade pierre no   13.558288206460086
then an idea came to him which harmonized everything   16.185670018448562
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone   12.035990042863157
d artagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in probability   15.337375761294197
lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went out   14.568655187620957
the crowd began to murmur and approached the house   12.540646320011431
thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply   15.502981936024927
touches upon the strange effects a half pistole may have   8.848558262250338
planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and mousqueton   7.223140228934229
said athos   20.291577024651076
neither you nor myself but fernand   17.153219941424915
d artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers   12.585472980836812
but now suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think him   22.245182875900632
oh unhappy woman   15.324300731469044
what has been the result   9.021749080038784
i shall retire and die tranquilly at home   11.594768938536273
you know there are different sorts   7.476733051094546
and i imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon her that i had imprinted upon my poor brother   8.668980994481432
the justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of god   17.055145817573695
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven   3.281808771574388
in that m   9.095707472121898
and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss   18.394571037852174
but it is not the same with travellers   13.173139621787461
he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence   7.105537844054845
you mistake i understand you perfectly   12.172240813262748
so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse   10.7549492498188
these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo   11.611311341265326
it was a tolerably fine winter s day and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison   12.264281628975779
• you provide in accordance with paragraph 1   14.20569685416814
the general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down   11.135486976080847
at these words moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his guest   9.324533694401072
he first kills m   10.240946253951018
he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawing room saw haydée who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back   13.049314205857737
very true said monte cristo   14.072019743024239
if the emperor remained on the throne gérard required a different alliance to aid his career   18.189081258678556
oh   15.831755615328426
on quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception room   11.136391107973434
m   10.793904076461374
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach   9.116137140556276
well said the president   15.261895350810866
you must take grimaud and olivain   16.21193414744426
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect   13.393972378956235
sire sire murmured the minister for pity s approach m   11.14497810471633
should you be glad to hear that the comte de la fere is well   21.855717634654233
not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me 4 000 piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than 24 000 livres of our money a sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country   10.937237582751969
what do you mean to say   14.160293999780974
i swear to heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him i will fall upon them   15.048646573056551
he must be mad said the inspector   10.46588833787996
the queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by laporte   9.579239119576679
i might not always be content with that answer replied the visitor for i come from one to whom everyone must be at home   8.275991806729209
well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire   13.07995826902924
that s right   12.9740534355649
cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him   9.762594256319128
in my name said mme   12.562168595747572
it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur   4.876120983062929
d avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative   8.80047903935622
well upon my honor said athos your eminence is right in taking us with you   10.587360793721913
when the soldier saluted charles athos s heart bounded for joy   6.895788611606218
bah said debray   11.27735633958365
far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast   15.315057684944138
but it is not a horse for hard work   6.094131704805815
were you a priest i should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind   16.62353156931596
de tréville entered the king s cabinet boldly and found his majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his whip   9.396144953044882
pardon pardon my officer and i will tell you all   14.731519010518294
that is not his biggest scoop said morcerf   12.679036464341287
did you see her after her return from brussels after the king s death   8.918063816681418
asked the musketeer   9.248652721093613
on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the hôtel de londres   14.014254262866134
i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well more especially as i have news to give him that will improve his appetite   11.535457624610885
and he rapped his pocket book in which he had just placed a letter   13.337773178850611
that will be better and you will be more useful to me   12.74082859551276
behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation   11.208884657192932
well then take him said the cardinal   9.170264732596145
will you give me a lesson the day after to morrow   6.739316185923117
both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twenty five years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic   16.50488787927791
the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was   20.756809401664874
the friends embraced cordially   15.37702854623267
so i have been told already monseigneur cried bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but i swear to you that i know nothing about it   11.9086167545305
the coachman stooped down for his orders   15.153657544887816

me   9.851118657435029
d artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter   8.652802132003515
and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him   12.228801806645455

in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use a sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open   16.40186503862258
and upon what then must i live   9.513600391808524
very good   21.93593263303607

villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter   20.670007359377344
sometimes grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the contrary   7.610793690179638
said the light horseman   7.549414536711634
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape   13.997457015000228
the duke thanked monsieur de chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawing paper for him   11.619734921488178
i felt my legs fail me   13.307930696734422
the clerks gone mme   13.29906531711366

silence child   7.040902656988885
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek   3.376512363799602
but wherefore are you here   7.440597996052129
no monseigneur   15.624937650534713
yes   16.661584505242523
his despair when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality   8.72389696080623
the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume   8.12321390453162
when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied milady in a tone of deep conviction god pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom   14.618547711771427
his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel   16.805646352757876
if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward   9.17952754568345
has bedeau been killed   10.102594854112406
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure   14.831223813375635

demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word   9.446421643108085
said groslow sighing   13.95987209609063
at ten o clock the guns of the louvre announced the departure of the king and then a movement similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops ran though the multitude which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard   6.485660144969416
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly   13.30966293120353
these were all who were left of the little troop   16.96128260727808
monsieur said the young woman you weary me very much i assure you with your questions   6.373177245810154
that s it said the tutor   19.27772367260505
porthos paid his compliments to m   9.48117295779388
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m   12.94282457103989
do not let that disturb you i have enough for two   22.097849273621485
andrea seized the certificate of his father s marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents   15.633954987678806
but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle   9.033698103142779
it had been said that evening a hundred times and scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject   11.265949693593694
we must trust in heaven   5.80910499135556

he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men   15.887448455450969
and then he was called fernand   12.877694538808143
i was deceived as it appears and i ask your pardon   13.374455716545311
the viscount de bragelonne   14.232463597724006

he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds   9.936270167366397
he endeavored to speak but the words died on his lips   7.522963257831622
then the iron hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast   9.901450545776575
truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits   8.212116999283408
since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions   0.5982127962837289
i am commissioned to find out my companions and i began by you who were the very soul of our society   8.14014312308371
said monte cristo putting the light near his face   18.095280854787347
it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined   7.118843949232439
asked beauchamp   11.305166450704494
do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard her shield the pledge for her dignity for her fortune and her life   9.034464081581262
and your friend has nothing more to ask for madame de longueville   10.355857831603782
no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers   14.678716169072043

at three o clock the sound of fireworks let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin   18.755374777796533
why the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each other   7.251666401629769
your horses got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strange looking man an arab a negro or a nubian at least a black of some nation or other at a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself   8.823139918688478
my friends that s exactly like me   9.422938983964908
read she said   10.368159157925799
very well sir replied broussel what is this order   12.904971767528929

come now what are your conditions   11.509743206447622
but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette   6.574363120697831
they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop   16.200279879864045
however i m glad not to fight them until to morrow   11.559704166964453
there said the young man handing kitty the letter sealed   10.704100664985534
said d artagnan   11.279348217317173
there came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded d artagnan and planchet   15.32497001277879
that montague is in the bastille   19.894981031895266

a friend maximilian   12.38765048969913
give me a draft for 4 998 louis on these gentlemen and our banker shall take it   11.916649828023354

my god my dear host tell me if anything has happened to him   5.4856375807092554
i will name you the lucretia of england   11.902427271412607
madame cried mazarin what are you about   14.471158285023884
the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently   11.648823872477278
perhaps returned the count smiling   14.463595636128638
give that to milady   11.441580734796863
at least we shall see each other again m   16.190995954592864
i also have had dreams   13.87466643849378
he only drank from the cask   21.531200443875335
i recollect now   17.205079395616114
the pistols were loaded   7.624035223674619
beauchamp announced the servant   10.215071120519552
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at d artagnan   4.733769412838025
what is he aiming at   8.300015821867666
they went into the chateau   13.852573145454357
now i travel a great deal particularly on this road and i wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune   8.381487377560973
good luck to you   17.57971991834381
but you can not break it off in this way   11.15721851208108
cried d artagnan yes   5.456820877871594
said d artagnan looking at her for the first time with much attention   10.028248542310969
albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the door   10.026036439725932
it is no news to you added d avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her   13.960088278215622
that is sufficient my lord   6.6191748840161795
plague on t i will guard the king and porthos shall guard the cardinal   21.557208958868603
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house   7.220733032369177
it was not long before they joined the escort   8.690276944049138
the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour   15.486511808750286
to maintain a cause which i believed sacred i have lost the throne and my children their inheritance   9.096050774524938
this fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon   14.95620748781343
madame de saint méran has arrived and her husband is dead   12.664860612915222
exactly like me   13.972213742187407
why thou art posted here by heaven   12.25685265848515

two persons were coming down the stairs   11.548809293374514
neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it   15.525600621607648
by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level   8.42224405694993
anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me   12.600906747159376
they resolved to profit by the count s courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained   10.261573459811576
haydée chapter 78   18.17751316269733
i do not think that such is his intention said morrel   1.1101149632067582
he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so   9.520501514768117
asked the king   13.74214247719074
no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer   13.436674470438902
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all   9.11371653345103
be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for you for you as aramis   14.463093406537268
then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground   14.342461057911619
now said planchet let us bind him to a tree   13.304514539571583
the way was opened for you unexpectedly   14.327196178093372
i presume that she has returned to tours   8.901222026613105
as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm   9.634787866209699
none my lord   14.138674119591757
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat   10.815518763770452
and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our lives   16.64731608441047
three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church   7.563937228732203
by no means madame   19.15339139294837

yes yesterday   11.743911001099374
it is one of my friends who loves her monsieur athos this gentleman here   14.665455384906767
d artagnan went up to him   16.72252814163324
i think he entered the service   8.969636583925631
you must be mad my friend said the baroness   7.671468065019749
as we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity   7.266564492127711
now the mischief is out   10.622790961418497
then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant   21.899565709852332
said he   8.358722369238341
handsome well bred noble lord as you are my dear athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations   4.319613825002205
and what is this cause   10.480993751562378
well this is just what amuses me said monte cristo   14.71152300296258
is there any need of that   13.197898966704287
or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition   14.902190602947494
yes   7.533523781457188
he said take this take it and send for something immediately   12.967747380922956
asked athos   5.319692038262749
it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will   2.743480103659506
what was it then   10.366248423608926
afterward monsieur de tréville fought with others in his first journey to paris five times   10.929109952625288
three hundred pistoles   15.927372046250039
de villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear me   14.507143336523846
but it is the wretched that man can not injure me haydée said monte cristo   5.533222190943717
you do not know what he is about in the cellar   16.57432772016593
said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you   11.706962834480164

if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be lost   10.503588250509495
he said after having swallowed the divine preserve   13.61251623750501
the arms of d artagnan fell powerless by his side   15.495865159785456
and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table   14.315074298412924
said he   10.03580237754024
good   8.228851006493922
and as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the rhône from which it had its source and the post road it had depleted not a hundred steps from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description   13.35255121965136
0141m so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man   8.180211891561243
he then arose   14.16197338886763
how you manoeuvre my instructions count   18.26835407079333

mercédès is dead madame said monte cristo   2.8833621766182116
two aces   18.145570442666422
they continued to admire it but said no more about it   7.543061289095815
the door had itself opened noiselessly   14.89898542619961
a mere matter of precaution answered the gascon   13.879285626725697
i am entirely at your service except only for my orders   5.934009716478938
be easy my dear boy   10.441177146437317
maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss   18.179941947948254
you keep the registers of entries and departures   7.70215419238123
this woman has come back again into england for the purpose of conspiring against my life   10.529195467736502

his majesty has so good a heart that he can not understand hatred   1.865446980406885
should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task   18.140245818476043

there may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood   8.771641822028075
and what shall i command him   4.747724079818347
he entered after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial which always announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions   16.999940700046775
but that is not all   5.2237155390828125
asked morrel   13.758692383231049
and that is the only reply you make   8.800116794861983
ah you see that plan was not sure enough   7.79303853901164
but look   12.461488588837721
he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth   17.47629587589985
my lord said athos do not let us disturb you   20.729606825049224
the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercédès   13.134423942135278
and kitty who had not let go the hand of d artagnan led him up a little dark winding staircase and after ascending about fifteen steps opened a door   5.403957319625496
dessessart s men   11.783821945133923
i am well i want nothing   9.932600080289209
cried the duke   6.835750745888078
no   7.551425358687593
i made no resistance   5.638638910257478
what shall we do   13.840485293350877
but d artagnan had now slipped through the window   20.294442753878087
the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile because she saw nothing but misery around her   7.988432732065058
thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a churchman   6.419296005632303

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg™ s goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come   6.778974443220629
the night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take   12.648017221654934
albert came up to them at this moment with franz   7.551969044798269
he then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols   10.244154106905752
her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan   15.052788209553377
certainly it was not the cardinal   12.497191238497575
tell someone to bid her come here that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count   19.498363928919396
oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed   13.377169584447563
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength   16.737072454193772
30023m m   11.868298873864179
what was his name   10.432541166855854
the face of the first was lost to parry in the darkness   8.685846442454324
i rang for a light but as no one came i determined to find one for myself   11.285379946253615
when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere   14.273939488618149
it cried   8.925604353607529
undoubtedly   11.142580153731318
said albert   8.245052833138097
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply   20.598547865719713
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations   18.7753593728505
if the musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed   10.070763340170718
oh   15.8722282243478
to morrow night we shall rescue you   14.706370388824443
upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us   8.4237230054992
how can i tell   13.26662607375973
he went to bed at his usual hour and slept in peace   14.126778099507344
ah it is jacopo she said the captain of the yacht   10.006504776769376
but the king where is the king   11.825469647870634
he was a great man   18.88926357740123
denis or the faubourg st   18.00591885630051
but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for raoul a young man must live respectably   6.266340191122361
you suppose then that there are some   7.690805583886686
well what do you wish me to do for you   9.896743723901167
but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands   15.110924723468786
it was you who sent for me   9.131881681281854
chapter lxi   5.684019818830701
the procureur   7.862961792687054
do not say that debray returned beauchamp laughing for here is château renaud who to cure you of your mania for paradoxes will pass the sword of renaud de montauban his ancestor through your body   14.704839196081318
does he correspond with aramis   10.968693815865398
such things continued bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession   11.209764957696073
can we count upon you   8.89175355544781
when i speak of ignominy you think i speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or death   8.987690179216811
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last   8.739396271901985
there   10.660867204490723
is she beautiful   12.039075001648383
but what   18.20193075555384
if you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left shoulder   11.64355811230771
i have it still   3.509275830599343
the waking when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream   11.384791870760287
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection   10.520644278370874
indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down   14.735801595981886
yes   6.392607926596684
that is doubtless our boat said athos   2.886279988164917
yes   12.601338304471478
is he rich   21.04887184061895
they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man   17.337454398987884
and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres   2.09136770022951
as for the count he had fallen on his chair   19.420357901323726
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody   6.217839862098435
athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door   11.590118167565459
notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna he slid down like peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his feet   8.07038402559461
all these women had been or were beautiful   7.0723199438488935
said she   11.658635607318974
it is only a loss of money which i have sustained nothing worth mentioning i assure you   16.43288996015463
i   14.068239685095925
de morcerf   14.545619981633767
to come back and besiege rueil   9.088812842842252
go upstairs she said to the doctor   10.43938268552574
do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then   6.400492751645473
they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans   9.836612882134993
30169m notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa   12.985494634718348
said d artagnan placing his hand eagerly on his ring   9.249110563423283
monte cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her   10.412774106585736
the sergeant put the lantern near the panel   4.854033258252062
on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet   4.940278620110555
said jacopo   6.905686573649499
oh real enough from anxiety doubtless at any rate they postponed the matter for two months   11.128813699253747
about half past six   9.38029247049003
do not overwhelm me with happiness cried d artagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him   14.61765109306922
think for a moment   14.258005365836862
international donations are gratefully accepted but we can not make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states   7.626397749874652
maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little   12.249408242422835
he then inquired how they had fared in their trip   9.365651924978463
repeated morrel as if awakening from a dream   13.157168225138017
he has just left me   11.124019171441683
the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body   13.198496246723305
the commission is usually one and a half   11.62799802210545
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak   15.503474407208975
something you have worn and that i may wear in my turn a ring a necklace a chain   18.621723815349565
no i have left off laughing now that you speak french   17.81356938996572
science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one   13.642731237750542
i do not know you for one of us   16.14433271410035
i found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend   12.83722530389475
he had made his valet cover him with honey   5.988672692164604
org   7.671783864180174
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment   10.246468804295812
the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot   13.776633168850003
on his left was porthos whilst d artagnan was on his right   13.399008061483764
yes sire as they always do   14.642421117761618
then said monte cristo you went to him   12.108698590313008
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess   7.642175024399542
oh sire   5.682118458336826
of whom   11.782373396018583
and i think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed   15.020779099856085
said aramis   12.776998614906176
but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged   13.036145352910298
the crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be tumultuous   7.015071882876071
and another voice which like an echo repeated dead dead   8.072310597371796
yes excellency returned the steward   12.1113674190438
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy   11.64776913079859
valentine smiled sadly   10.10245780364796
the porter was not yet gone to bed   8.727523118518357
chapter x   22.219225025035264
you wished to double it and how   14.181120254949366
come said d artagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery   9.137511398161969
that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shop people and the bands of mendicants reappeared   0.24153637467398248
but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne   13.908721180472954
it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england   15.300122407545954
sir sir cried he turning to noirtier do what you can make me understand in some way   5.3427281386115855
here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm eaten table which with the stool and the goat skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell   11.872339172947594
yes   9.440893874815231
stop   11.224246125114155
i point one of the poniards at la ramee s breast and i say to him my friend i am sorry for it but if thou stirrest if thou utterest one cry thou art a dead man   18.749468985752774
said franz   7.407647780025061
he was in a court surrounded by high walls   5.436451815368745
in fact i am dead   11.948980347108526
yes to morrow   18.77443878933684
then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand   15.692349369316567
oh yes replied the count   10.512677403505805
i hope so   23.300209436861877
but for d artagnan all aspects were clothed happily all ideas wore a smile all shades were diaphanous   9.95855862825452
she may have forgotten something   7.884747793291474
bernouin went out and soon returned with comminges who was on guard   3.960083028903407
the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the catacombs of saint sebastian   15.540485063658835
1   19.472028966875286
here s a louis that smells confoundedly of straw   2.537008349272037
good said he as he went away   13.265241667827764
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table   10.267118132814279
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away   10.21974876614279
you don t know him perhaps but i know him   1.1995556462177426
and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me   11.380450838624043
said athos and what puts you out of breath thus   1.937577536066314
it concerns the best interests of your father said the messenger   12.492345506067966
3 1627 it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done   8.918135087550546
ah   15.666250123643355
the jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess   7.183528616507322
he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty   13.9428079522367
they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis   8.499299938735815
milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a chicken   10.992976869230631
and i have but one scruple that of leaving my dear grandmother s remains which i had undertaken to watch   10.567157701216363
and i said debray   13.510725509273666
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach then the coachman s voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows   11.717339593365484
e   13.43047715863461
he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman s little finger   23.29860940663862
but the king is with mazarin   7.662104644290765
aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion   17.008108911281642
emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard the well known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived   17.791911447379817
during the war with spain he was employed in the commissariat of the french army and made a fortune   6.559727042109972
he will consider us as brothers   5.5752429542972255
i don t see what is to keep me here   7.922364373200632
you remain in london   15.416578821514124
and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest injury   9.704607922156875
then in the midst of the songs of his sailors songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down he saw the island of monte cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert   9.686755145105574
as they say in my country   12.748754579654301
is being in love conspiring   13.265982323061973
and that the men whom god has put above those office holders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fill i say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation   15.214190726157614
sire stammered the baron   8.051946408239973
people cry out long live the king   13.699956723031574
whilst lord de winter turned to her with a glance which said did i not answer for them   11.087830410939684
albert de morcerf   9.090964747097884
at length with a violent effort at self control the name of that woman   10.570435694378697
i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman that he may be at ease   17.40668318297032
we have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame   16.163593288259538
not old cavalcanti   8.956706249615817
if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them   7.856634820941585
la mazzolata gentlemen said the count of monte cristo as he entered i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated   11.556520172230988
28   3.4695127332833273
said albert horror stricken   16.96063874275752
under what circumstances did we meet   6.243634318871695
but having received the signal that i might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sun dial for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhéry even a sun dial and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longer by the by sir do you think dormice eat them   13.303384803597337
this secret aramis does not belong to us   11.353091045073493
but he had gone too far to draw back   12.516032275551206
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf s apartments   10.516967824892973
must see him   12.642093452337473
when will it be our turn to think of these things   14.32148436395769
i know nothing   10.658200867573813
we are about to ascertain sire replied d artagnan as he rapidly left the room   12.37351940542796
the countess g wished to revive the subject of the count but franz announced he had something far newer to tell her and in spite of albert s demonstrations of false modesty he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days   10.899312908163859
i can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged   14.267740970165343
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again   8.682100811909116
five minutes after the door keeper again appeared   16.888655142995834
the third an excellent abbé like aramis   17.67900856481053
are you sure of it   15.817182177630468
chapter xiv   15.075571258250779
true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up   10.216006692036931
good said d artagnan to himself   6.645319258037017
a few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse   16.18079183554588
i should think so indeed   6.870082639706367
good morning my dear host cried d artagnan   19.36799965057588
in fact he did not notice the offered hand   11.060163654434833
young people stop there   15.488111504879807
this was the chief of the band luigi vampa   9.041965706243506
two varieties of demons chapter lxiii   10.911654934258678
unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied they   11.820622323707624
laws alone swamp our small staff   11.616877845653384
do you think so   14.43522555291763
really your manner of speaking it expresses my meaning and that is all i want   6.913354335367164
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark   12.851132853866513
and misfortunes make us jealous   11.473184866867369
she has been punished monseigneur   2.586554219124526
there was a profound silence   12.57296958894712
disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine   4.3329084524236
my brother s carriage will be here first   8.453885186311183
drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all one s wit and cool judgment   8.264324319505395
but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england   15.268580092679468
and now when are we to go   14.851361399537273
because it is taking people unawares   13.796951679527803
he found him kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer book   19.139478337647933
good lord   7.515465529045922
all at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me start   14.047239227815986
deuce take it   17.738995175805893
the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me   11.516612246182147
i ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people   9.817161587453517
de villefort even would not have alarmed him   14.003314446805879
i promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner   8.045269117116298
in the meantime i remain here   16.61583037163816
nonsense   4.9630609834364146
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their brother   5.335656412640982
come sit down and tell us all about this signor vampa   9.370733591025003
the count   11.136202554805951
we leave you in an excellent tone of mind   16.497010080841896
the pavilion at nine o clock d artagnan was at the hôtel des gardes   15.348556074483877
ah there he is calling me now   16.33872691361909
she felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity   18.49017342316206
certainly said peppino   15.850531754885193
go directly   21.151491855863853
oh see maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you   10.310537696503356
you can not make me believe that   9.3945121127515
well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me   8.520027314792907
sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them   17.819332202612085
to dinner   8.18080650307634
well then we shall go down into the court   10.461740776717935
de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province   13.623103612053066
midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose   16.12980155177435
this was neither long nor difficult   8.197413389179626
and now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred   15.522707567123664
nearly one third of the paper had been consumed by the flame   11.820818735844234
my dear athos   15.55058150659863
there followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching   14.741573328272352
edmond smiled when he beheld himself   5.489303818566327
to caderousse s great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the count s breast flew back blunted   16.57098554442375
she shall live and with me   6.154634882945919
and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows   16.464739893709023
let us see said d artagnan   13.186896002793793
he cast his eyes again on the letter   19.828939624057444
this instant i entreat you   10.467414147928759
50111m my dear m   16.631454605067912
do not think so   11.497265914136321
then why did she go just god   18.482386864828907
a conjugal scene as athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down   11.580164307228674
for my part dear mother interposed renée i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into m   14.176054235342905
d artagnan alone had discovered nothing he ordinarily the most inventive of the four   10.193204449870969
on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees   12.03184632252443
i have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a european misfortune   11.211808879971121
but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto   16.48426387460941
there is no drawing back   16.505000211917576
porthos   13.075160663665244
ah no joking viscount if you please   11.34423821437202
he lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to heaven and recognized friquet   15.811570383907684
0065m as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted   14.399890299194194
just so   18.73992728586852
you believed that you would fly from me by returning to paris   18.84846046482779
but they may catch him yet   7.927537128026643
come your excellency the count added turning to franz here is luigi vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed   16.413612295549257
it seems that he is a spaniard   9.259469620303088
he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred   15.905328267877142
dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion   11.906726987141374
they put the stone back in its place   18.135762943793445
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do   10.76104742066012
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time   16.635485144969106
if he troubles me too much i will crush him the insect   16.010703867532328
alas sir said he i can not but perceive how sadly i miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you   10.96758007705862
on the contrary it would tempt me were i any other man rejoined aramis   21.021762997603126
one instant my dear friend replied the abbé   7.2730953096169095
god knows how much i love revere you   14.903147900193073
their horses were fed but not unsaddled   14.794099283349206
no my friend said athos you must leave us   15.578452610240781
waiting for whom   16.69673502739667
i have them   7.324506449674452
with you d artagnan with you porthos all four reunited for the first time for twenty years we would dare not only england but the three kingdoms put together   5.744543457296733
monsieur de richelieu would have said five hundred crowns for the councillor   13.0387749920018
she said at length   18.03859761923668
i thought so my lord said felton   14.76535239425524
yes said madame danglars that is she   16.265571871768984
the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman   12.433328009884367
cried porthos   7.067212756055903
she seemed to love me so   5.594749843974746
athos smiled   16.362778538594387
exclaimed the abbé springing from his seat   6.550353787087317
people fight for all sorts of reasons you know   7.55530582979821
well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good steel   17.26159791275909
athos was the last to enter   12.31967691409269
there and elsewhere   6.465551618591821
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all   21.463514487756402
but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercédès   14.648046162357952
yes three on horseback and three who have dismounted   5.48957120517703
well edmond i swear to you by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity edmond for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold   18.694788616163365
this instant duke   10.990813730886895
how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir   19.835393031058068
try at least to give me an idea of what it is   12.91441395761125
cried he to d artagnan do not kill him young man i beg of you   10.411864895129026
your excellency i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers i neglected to bring them   10.890521430123526
you must pardon him my lord said la ramee for i directed him to come   19.285701873039056
speak out answered d artagnan   9.898187332382498
ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfather s look at that moment would more than compensate for all   16.323247679837078
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise   10.722499910324174
we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it   17.21281716649897
well said milady what can those who sleep wish for a happy awakening   10.727234695571658
d artagnan relates that on his first visit to m   11.06651078070838
the abbé lowered the shade   11.417034223110397
asked the two gendarmes   10.591207077072912
his head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell   12.478651541612642
a light cloud passed over the count s face   7.876156478014789
but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on morrel s breast   14.254652175870984
for my part i think what they say is very well said and quite worthy of two gentlemen   19.316180324932738
however that might have been the priest dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him   10.48029400854885
when you eat use every precaution   10.468340250682315
andrea shrugged his shoulders   20.48577574021573
judge not rashly says the gospel replied the cardinal   17.125983040892393
but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you correctly   13.844144705898998
count added mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof   14.764950771721674
de tréville it had disappeared   8.666970148232885
said albert   11.369886776224776
that horse was to have identified us in the day of battle   7.867136435714508
d artagnan and planchet entered pierrefitte together   8.790453861870041
well   16.054378837956293
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began   14.011900186413824
occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let france settle matters as she will with me resumed mazarin   6.24975349915819
in an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back   20.1371888993213
both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack   14.747985540033689
you may torture torment kill me but you shall not have my signature again   16.167995447056374
your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table   15.865891442930419
he cried   11.92662033261187
caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller   2.915218302537644
but whither shall we fly whither escape   15.926845796397249
i fear lest athos should have been beaten down by serving men   10.669666082622694
thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom   18.873406518735855
you are the chevalier s prisoner   9.603588317671498
yes my mother said albert i will return and woe to the infamous wretch   18.871760250036715
you are certainly an extraordinary man said danglars   14.875444233680845
it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps   11.841172311287844
see the fatal example on the vendomois road d artagnan you so brave and you porthos so valiant and so strong you were beaten   5.488237277483943
marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on mericourt   6.553075969593592
then he took the boy upon his knee   8.035032256083147
give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants   16.256364424289963
and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune   5.447726471243026
and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window   23.64536360481845
to this question de guiche could not respond   17.73251313686772
i have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping albert on the steps   15.570098984366066
you must hope for us both maximilian   0.28448526351973946
oh i ll answer for you said the gascon filling porthos s glass to the brim   19.88948911364799
why dramatic   16.54536784932892
meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of louis xi   14.333904046459576
tell me is this the moment for a wedding   15.701450549382312
athos smiled   11.900934571672726
well this man   6.58512048471184
blaisois was in a state of great excitement   11.721017742184197
ah   14.232488245948524
oh   11.925196563358048
i am at home there   21.34966604716943
and if you come another fathom nearer i ll stave your wicked head in with this oar   20.032634105085418
directly afterwards the moon rose   17.10198932889995
it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance   7.130406890291419
accept it my lord accept it said aramis   21.566921199737155
that s the place milady s own residence   14.945739777767603
said athos wit his quiet tone   17.290951546849154
if when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the sea   5.818709846903068
he answered in the same language   10.238631182171563
ah   7.422262472856229
the one with a white dress and so many diamonds the fair one   10.137268169748225
her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination   9.89532258062651
monsieur de guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army   13.931733880905329
but alas   13.986333918448267
aramis went so close to chatillon as almost to touch him   14.328997818050022
oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth   13.928602115406745
my son said the abbé you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as i do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes   7.387205195263358
the place royale   11.566856761512133
ah you do not love me   24.897816960801247
all villefort s influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dantès had so nearly divulged   8.059652543513916
franz and albert were opposite the via delle muratte   11.318963387365885
on the contrary my dear friend this diamond became our only resource   8.721378911998872
do you know him   15.062952816877177
you say either too much or too little   23.71219174079625
what are you doing   12.341527832807067
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning   21.12046013127504
as you say mazarin is a knave   17.37189488242708
it is said m   11.084107823901036
at this word athos and aramis jumped up   13.85190885743689
have you not heard that some one is coming here   12.054003831125454
de tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes   10.192158167155945
yes   16.957018051006198
oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as mazarin s than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right   14.371261431804786
you know porthos i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends   13.26905643274888
said albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow   18.52513533305883
his panegyric has been uttered   11.565381758488922
have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial   12.131582347562684
fools said charles do they take me for a coward like themselves   17.333722217341915
this lady was the daughter of nicholas de camus who arrived in paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself   20.025273117962367
d artagnan took off the ring giving it again to athos   11.136338522671409
ah what else is there   6.922709224694567
the same flower of innocence had flourished or was still flourishing on their brow that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house   7.524963348245642
one of them went away and dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement   13.391013891288646
debray maximilian morrel and m   12.655106370036592
thank you said luigi drawing back his hand   9.0347626749102
i will take care of mousqueton said grimaud   9.817071192165363
but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition   17.652272073698352
and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house   6.955135235433242
immediately on the arrival of m   7.317867958878748
let one of us put on the dress and mount the king s horse   13.408801056939755
however i think it was something very like a rendezvous   15.501059968796453
come my dear bazin tell me where he is   2.9143267071966505
for a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous sea serpent of the constitutionnel   12.60573085299633
he has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle   12.197187746422195
you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely   11.400088220077048
it was too warm in the room was it not count   11.603059177560638
gracious heavens m   11.75294316403894
but the other four cursed it heartily   17.633010434826108
i am ready said maximilian   1.5282685453718887
madame and i were there two years ago   10.132118315016154
his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love   11.445428410398742
lansquenet for instance   12.591535152950016
let us hear   15.37756220887486
at eccuis the same scene was repeated   13.423950786883033
every evening either in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs he met the pretty soubrette   12.803504748687194
and here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money   5.98662237539049
so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more   20.017120185738307
but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love   9.310455821584064
what do you require then   10.796660999982999
that is somewhat difficult my lord said rochefort with a smile   13.715524144717605
oh difficulties do not affright me said d artagnan   11.472470913953055
i can not explain myself   10.761542129493813

the surgeon declared that the situation of the musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood   8.703364642554261
from which besides we can not retreat without shame   19.632793780626947
then the countess g has returned to paris has she   8.129192132897916

we are going with a mission to her majesty the queen of england   15.51470144017243
you too have been in england sir   14.2787467624557
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor   13.759288196852417
men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the café de paris   10.005792346424855
if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life   9.609130543378704
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace   7.971411024861827
he saluted and made a movement to depart   12.211744766773421
the man who abducted my wife   8.904681130130086
m   10.690334686745146
m   11.654768699893843
i ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like you   7.221556507155695
de monte cristo purchased a house at auteuil   7.546181150228029
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides   17.62658038950366
but my lord you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered   12.328440174850252
i do not jest said athos   3.5917594718083716
if porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said athos   13.52003812128143
what more do you want   14.298046158282334
perhaps so   13.340419408695363
as captain of the musketeers m   20.485302528852124
and had the pretty madeleine no news   15.51189535845389
the doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by d avrigny   13.555273467303923
he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks   14.138902790528034
who art thou   6.386589593616237
it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile   10.91271173797521
the return chapter xxix   19.69587502470614

their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of d artagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his thunders   8.015442650576887
the man cried out   13.49133472980186
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris   9.874619031551704
and how did it happen   13.505562844238508
my death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner   15.703612045428525
but when i visit a country i begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves   16.005854471203904
know of the existence of this treasure which   10.073811129569464
i swear it before the god who hears me   9.846161539986028
quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no   14.115694237584044
0311m edmond preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island   8.332081319241858
inquired he   10.561295753710548
my husband the king is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired   15.646984634159718
i am lost   16.186691377518947
it was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it   10.91392536504459
you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone   8.73217523119806
all this looks suspicious   12.444380826750207
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force   7.659455610678887
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened   9.839379426684626
another gasconade   12.98983335324122
with certain people everything comes round   14.30805840880211
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned   14.454925642821514
you are too just and reasonable a man monsieur   10.205824037272286
i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money today   4.7232409572468415
good my child   11.164092908676404
you see someone pays me a visit   9.360586564564866
still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain   21.15858582587306
said porthos   15.678363185663127
bravo   15.917174341831972
yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished   19.117392444404985
devil take me   7.80915264598681
if such be the case my dear valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his presence   13.101508703899059
from whom   2.6246700605683575
gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave   6.909095756305677
then taking a passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months longer   13.185693795411558
but in case he is beaten   13.147213996675665
valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation   16.81721047004385
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell   6.007538590632507
you are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin   9.209585591279586
pardieu gentlemen said he   7.934465957045432
it is men who make you weep   0.498078754984693
fortunately he fancied that dantès was delirious   11.087335131514692
i see them about twenty paces behind my lord   14.053175065874571
ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him   10.640864320480992
50211m madame said the count it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness but i offer you consolation   6.344172710061645
sit down there and eat in security   20.087899844339873
i saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when i breakfasted with the count   10.12316724931628
good evening maximilian   12.658676749887775
that he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he appears   15.136525203733218
he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said s accommodi   12.672182628996781
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats   6.965832256363129
de tréville s   7.236345136647093
i promise   7.742531948634558
he s posted there   6.764678894089261
but that is not all   9.957868948445403
the count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her shoulder   16.023939767910825
her dress which was that of the women of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls   15.797817933036399
at the end of the dinner he entered in person   13.863473197534377
well i must mortify myself   13.686229956797487
people pay here before they eat   8.057341805678597
at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived   7.8814289312952415
and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times   11.27297101264813
relate it said monte cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings   16.34133977321412
of what must i repent   11.537929801683704
but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus   11.527393333011991
my intention was if caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the custom house officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew   16.297766042009652
we never joke replied peppino solemn as a quaker   9.087914448006998
poor creatures   12.445047704109603
it is incredible   11.630558516478692
time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when vampa should be twenty and teresa nineteen years of age   14.071546157859473
and you leave us said julie at a moment s warning   14.29778458920986
the trial   11.384994606628064
then a double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body   8.978710205611474
said maximilian   13.647149521423362
monsieur i have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me this morning so that i have not a sou left in case i should be cold   12.2678817416351
alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened   1.6874472246756067
you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take   15.723989720028914
it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired   1.3574613717198218
all the same resumed he after having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows   6.80060912303402
hold if that should happen although i am a christian m   14.105324456117597
asked the queen   5.617381616171609
they told me it was 4 500 francs   9.212289206272088
his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer   16.30875698156699
here is a soup which is rather inviting   13.810523017037688
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost   2.2576021427934965
for she would have served as the sport of the whole band   15.709356378811407
i thought i did not mistake   20.214092576624076
after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket   13.351222873679127
the soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy   5.017180973369676
d artagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is   10.24959021245215
a black point floated on the sea   7.974505696673549
here my lord here said she keep this in memory of me   18.080933983741797
d artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it   10.515383065001693
you stand upon his property   10.719154466833121
i only speak that exact truth   13.90538532519259
i have done   8.514048752304483
exclaimed the queen and i will prove to them i have not left   10.271220348345338
mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one   13.701523066720497
upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of affair   18.66898802932691
grimaud began to scale the wall again   15.417092147145029
d artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions as the breakfast at the priest s could only be counted as half a repast in return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him   15.725749619122174
the thing is clear as day said he   12.719281316713404
at least you don t speak well of him   15.990621347465591
the doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder   15.766708909639672
the soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him along   11.396422642285588
she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan   11.873491502771856
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior   9.956908740465153
yes i would do so   18.285260289061444
i will become a nun said milady   8.88673457877349
gentlemen said he monseigneur s order is you know to conduct that woman without losing time to fort la pointe and never to leave her till she is on board   7.391614130179768
cried porthos   14.400539294126997
without this danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his cell   5.8888233096113645
d artagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods   10.589211667935352
what have i done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me   24.141549098856366
ah you virtuous men   16.625526985379665
said he   13.281998257093932
louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmanteau   14.886163842469147
what is she doing then   12.69083709740049
i congratulate him upon it   13.772293532265042
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eels all light wholesome food suitable for the sick   11.728513013414085
said d artagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since i am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue   20.748054173255134
just this   10.843523774696756
there again   11.025300573990753
give her that poison recommending her soul to god and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at   16.149732610472167
her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor   16.315939673740708
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well   9.0994236908451
i mean a young man whom you patronize monsieur de tréville   14.660624958352745
i am indeed to be pitied   14.025012127686352
at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the mandaïa a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded paper   10.606484998112995
asked athos it is as dark as a cold oven   8.35688149398714
yes said the old man   22.396591049564893
oh i declare to you felton i thought him mad   8.993116450883754
this is all very strange said m   12.180592936736742
albert understood his thoughts   14.213238286459747
calm yourself   14.814322871085619
but d artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall   11.100343724755254
and d artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver   19.28687007628892
that of bracieux in the soissonais   12.32948502466114
that may be done if they can separate the king from his mother   19.79830293179082
d épinay can not leave the drawing room at present   6.220947429228526
then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy man   12.254620247572417
i have not handled a card or dice box   14.004665325895456
patience madame i am coming to it   18.28323096172844
i require honorable guaranties   15.051727323020675
that thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen   10.529661289883121
in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow   4.260819365622428
it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame de villefort   11.023823255826166
he dreamed that he was endowed with wings he wished to fly away   18.309747967956717
e   16.971572838690637
the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light   11.871328141607174
still five days before us   5.111950461803908
he exclaimed   11.564309122434025
this precipitation this unusual appointment   12.061355461176978
asked monte cristo   10.027449144686997
i do not know   8.18921152920951
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty s   3.899000680602086
porthos looked at d artagnan with an expression of profound admiration   9.382384107503839
you think of everything said d artagnan   11.28059698483092
so you hate each other   10.29700010630053
they are carved from granite   7.8296816985135145
it can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts   15.948114381052006
yes said harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table   12.769380320930674
be friends said the tutor   14.787998893885515
said the cardinal sternly   9.73659651088558
in our position one must provide for everything i shall try to gain the coast of france   9.875628196949437
you see we were quite right to pacify that country   23.69549333030841
answer me do not these crimes exist   21.435519281271247
it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count   15.542945295720653
she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal   4.555093442264282
pray say everything that is kind to countess g on the part of her friend the vampire   14.70465788348219
the poor girl under the caresses of d artagnan lifted her head   10.615887522577198
and they mean nothing new   19.41433996823708
the two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley slave   11.13979874377452
you are sagacious   19.346739781639254
for him those ten minutes were very long   11.199768621945157
monsieur porthos   13.2255348452309
i will deny it   15.728259623910084
at the foot of the cardinal s gallows   14.94574906278333
see gentlemen said m   10.655642939294612
tomorrow then   4.500338416812811
and i say that murders are committed here said morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months   12.838188902148284
d artagnan went out first as had been agreed upon   11.864262386682753
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble   19.096676865502573
the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose   10.024727015169278
athos said the king mechanically   12.38379420626563
besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth   12.871393478138623
inquired aramis   8.614173535033768
no carriage to be had   10.817306136146808
the scotchman   7.554635162095028
do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible   7.952671521514902
for i have found the means of strangling this hydra   16.25795438149974
my god   7.714124244329592
in the name of the love you once bore me   3.4439205147718077
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind   22.22959584654184
i command here   4.992508763212315
the guests chapter 40   4.709009212598375
undoubtedly said aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if i could have drawn without being recognized   14.796210752980961
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage   3.9581676966291965
as to that cried d artagnan after a moment of reflection i shall surmount it be assured   16.18385788193699
yes   7.415100278131494
said the major with a sigh   14.640667172093112
we are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass   11.050153822665667
it is ten years today since i saved your father s life who wished to die   10.193501053547289
well i will tell you what i did not like to mention on my return from yanina   10.937001815041487
i heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king   18.67481730741629
come come   17.022940259605317
his treasure was just as he had left it   7.258319975310312
yes pardieu   10.036266919538415
this is an enigma said athos but it matters not   21.134646647301942
do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good fortune and yours with mine and both of us to be dragged down there again   14.194889217546123
i will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them   11.637063176541265
under the second lamp on the right you will find your adversary   13.921707128146096
this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his father s residence or in his cabin on board the pharaon   14.176996264081158
it was a lieutenant s commission in the musketeers   8.182556607798647
the wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously   10.050352514913536
have you business there   12.8210536513227
at a league from beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud   9.727282193129357
why do you say so   9.543149201208015
now said planchet let us thank the queen   10.704968268299533
who told you so   14.848015454234128
he even came to force m   11.63655154576907
replied danglars pleased to find the other so tractable   8.706017015861903
he wished bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of m   10.503138081993301
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled   12.975372374673466
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges   12.929166844850693
at sight of this man d artagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the door   5.419219606489801
i do not know whether i ought to tell you what i suspect   16.65905873391828
speak madame   9.073778236732009
but stop   4.11562034815284
de saint méran   12.924143515530318
why said aramis one half were hanged and the other half were shot   8.961356811088582
and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her   10.591807896480319
if then i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very instant you would quit my service   14.407118389625417
athos lend me grimaud who in the society of his friend parry has perhaps picked up a little english and can act as my interpreter   10.121327568837467
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity   6.053057394222606
oh mon dieu   18.73755751679256
two years   11.809268800796817
eh dear friend said caderousse are wills ever made without codicils   11.897064405233204
and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it   22.760112352794547
madame de villefort started   8.70953455172834
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too   6.847542930915917
besides we must try our own arms   9.057710378555402
but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise   15.233093838656256
a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large   11.359665141107175
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor   13.60615928152536
the poor woman reclined where she had been left half fainting upon an armchair   21.67719666403716
were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million   5.355132285891243
f   18.420245912296817
half a pistole if you can find out said d artagnan   12.467585089820016
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened   15.563188792837199
it was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and strong   14.68198500660532
ah   16.975115145903356
but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure d artagnan   16.334490674262312
he is dead   12.647745230983794
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed   9.64434654362944
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders   12.394257368424073
in the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him   1.8953942881137813
you do   19.78248615157373
coward   13.476212927399171
and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it   7.6397518419482955
ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young man who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful information   9.041240060224665
and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile   8.074602893919852
one of them recognized him   4.432143215700701
he seated himself at his desk and d artagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter   12.27279063871251
silence   5.70075746128036
cried d artagnan don t call him porthos nor even vallon   10.427219050852834
my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open   9.405499809560325
responded peppino   14.914384756181434
de tréville had intimated to them his majesty s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of may and they must immediately prepare their outfits   18.73429548910918
and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard   12.34015280341782
i will not contradict you there said d artagnan   12.587989455244061
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to say valentine has been assassinated   14.630619327948676
he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when planchet approached and said i will lay a wager your honor that you and i are thinking of the same thing   5.359096027229493
alone   19.040954547235454
étienne soon returned from his errand   13.301014712966474
his desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever   8.910756723037602
exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality   10.686801127978345
directly sir   11.343367339768015
monsieur le prince is led by the coadjutor who is led by madame de guemenee   19.521291273556677
i will dare to at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard   7.445398757461354
porthos made a thousand flourishes asking bicarat what o clock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brother s having just obtained a company in the regiment of navarre   6.785333056396696
wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished   1.9458971733708434
quite so said albert if the way be picturesque   15.42285813448938
we fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by selim   14.724820029734179
i am at your service sir said the abbé with a marked italian accent   12.704212019330917
bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of her   10.365602507640457
cried mousqueton the man you upset is getting up   4.943003916792691
to saint helena   10.093219362741406
we shall require it   5.998716949171131
in a tone of reproach ah monsieur i had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman   14.52965688828345
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited   17.58303517182915
what telegraph do you intend visiting   12.601265960504026
m   14.665183425168198
but listen   9.598493776756866
they shook hands   8.967084764372
very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count   7.288500239387567
the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition   16.357439978804646
both entered and found themselves in darkness   11.498549264232514
perhaps replied d artagnan   9.408469185135619
monsieur returned maximilian raising the glass cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide us from ruin and our name from shame and disgrace a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot   4.6807256432316136
too much reality would always remain in my recollection   9.691171636496119
why not   9.796890552201571
become a frondist my friend belong to the fronde and remember that i fill the count s place in everything   12.166795538933542
yes replied madame de villefort   6.460867400231218
penelon replied julie go and inform m   16.94365532303015
you know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs   17.437585660820325
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed   9.917039476450228
you see i give you a wide range   15.420198917994222
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh   11.965327282937139
no my dear fellow it is not at all incredible   13.202151421811068
what do you mean   15.69545749828439
soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair   15.112325536467505
most willingly duke   10.738951159638175
read   1.6522916381560133
not morcerf   15.945726265198822
i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career   14.21680838939971
should andrea marry according to his father s views he will perhaps give him one two or three millions   16.265852493094126
the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture   17.01739425876609
the two gentlemen then went into the church   10.582640614563758
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock   6.909778380214285
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow   10.316813807802845
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber   14.356946284127927
not at all my dear sir said la carconte in her most gracious manner   9.203427527652577
low born fellows   4.249223340616013
and when i am gone you can open to him   15.287371630804918
d artagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out   18.11402617762964
the queen fell into a chair took the pen and signed   12.222860681245626
it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said beauchamp   15.142498373179386
the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there   5.087635076461983
you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the marchioness   0.07088985819847515
he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy   19.486190301761525
ah good then replied athos we will teach them these door breakers   15.77504647288826
julie said he to her cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs   11.295786272640825
i trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man   7.332905611241986
you have heard perhaps said the comte de salvieux one of m   10.134558259916854
and you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher   14.914167512826243
let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father   10.858683164371342
adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my door   17.685570142579643
look d artagnan   14.29997063069803
a proof of great humility or great pride said monte cristo   18.047479719551895
porthos breathed a sigh   8.962594576758063
d artagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs   14.225097290932492
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed   10.095975596132206
as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention   12.824066039946059
his secret then was in the past as had often been vaguely said to d artagnan   15.558823959571146
broussel was seated at the table with his family having his wife opposite to him his two daughters by his side and his son louvieres whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councillor an accident from which he had quite recovered at the bottom of the table   8.57809736295912
my dear mistress turquaine said the gascon if you happen to have any money lock it up quickly   5.737805295363816
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy   10.147322028177523
what no wine   16.22404280528424
what can it mean   7.310083500542984
she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched   12.590690472231207
d artagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to god   7.864669294582607
the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene   9.747756656813817
i perceive its utter impossibility   13.76791315579594
and m   10.666460827948477
the story begins in 1815   11.540244234971114
de villefort   9.225571868743817
i was sure it was so the hanging of people is my nightmare   16.894715108037623
he tried it on his left hand   22.636730118400095
d artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him   9.321770865739515
tell them oh tell them that corpse belongs to me   13.404556259300847
my lord said felton the baron de winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named charlotte backson   7.5459132354538925
really he is by no means a light load   10.671845058052833
you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words   18.044031683859714
ah wretch   10.146287202094166
send at twelve said danglars smiling   16.986801298529073
sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter   11.414655720331718
they employ him because they are afraid of him   4.165373906181234
oh yes   12.461089166530227
to your house dear porthos at pierrefonds   13.320052175414883
with those studs   16.800140534356014
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it   7.0813981643994435
mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the number   7.5361251296565035
from lord de winter   15.700914969672523
we have none   14.085935156307391
old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond   12.610160175138045
50056m and with this raillery andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd   18.513387548182482
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived   15.37309567774844
as soon as these studs shall be in your possession inform me   15.554027100645325
then sitting down by the fire my supper said he   10.613971944263357
can he be inconstant before being happy   19.28172723757347
you are his friend be ours also   14.285048353859555
but she added poor angel whom that monster of a gascon barely failed to kill   10.29908840725328
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary   12.606884758412008
porthos come with me to the left   8.933223307472444
tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton   12.704946168593011
said the lady laughing   15.198960837893267
i shall serve under the eye of your eminence and if i have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then i shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me   16.100708331720217
will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his majesty if by chance his majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of great britain   11.34865097711615
where do you come from   4.853268734862078
is he afraid of me or of his father   16.076419540286913
we want said athos charlotte backson who first was called comtesse de la fère and afterwards milady de winter baroness of sheffield   11.521762214980276
was i so badly lodged at rome   10.1591643797496
adieu perhaps farewell   8.09309432333875
nothing madame   7.682876136954103
zounds   21.199018479156393
the face of the commissary grew still darker   18.357127579799496
they rode forward and reached abbeville   9.14889640729098
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief   4.833207321252354
pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me   19.61738654976162
we must go said the superb lord of bracieux lest they should say we were afraid   10.575720631205796
what   15.845847275110913

monte cristo turned to haydée and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in greek πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖν that is tell us the fate of your father   16.898681417990087
i believe so replied aramis   7.877926621094477
great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand   10.160923456080274
the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise   10.933010746216578
i thought you were angry with me madame   10.30933184556223
milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard   12.539019042501216

it would be exceedingly droll   8.332794489449242
but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is   13.101650099017096
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity   10.220708942935019
that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen   10.262766107885392
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father   14.583149610905158
i will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he is   6.853932190309232
entirely so my dear d artagnan   10.757028919655369
as to athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating d artagnan by a look   12.483674511084343
all the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man particularly when that young man is a musketeer had disappeared as if by enchantment   12.600897503776643

the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help   14.065966431624737
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear   8.52646901316178

and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet   9.233364923236795

to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well   17.629007428766585
gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land   18.145697020235982
returning to her own room kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet   11.157736141092284

franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal   9.252849051562615
nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him   13.924162230468518

i missed her by twenty minutes at st   13.51083938413224
but at the foot of the stairs d artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane   13.553039491900009
the last   9.911510206881065
morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me   18.39935621926634
the ninny   6.8591469126836335
general said the president do not alarm yourself   12.364666994587482
and you understand what brings me here   14.833072788505152
franz paused for a moment   8.27207834591177
the lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table   8.315104661732155
planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill   10.44007553307961
thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known mousqueton well   7.209353889721556
but d artagnan had reckoned without the wind   15.333468313085481
asked porthos   13.269174712188953
said felton   5.348229143052182
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham   10.959105975922862
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity   6.634391998257989
and yet you said he had money   9.521949436357051
here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman   21.50328951112029
i have been waiting for someone who has not come   14.228188893295822
let us see what this letter contains   13.5482006591423
if he says true said the captain doubtingly   13.852883373713052
and against whom   7.8821788561031925
racine says   11.836979747398336
yes added athos i now ask you d artagnan what side you are on   7.51959553470385
milady seemed overcome with joy and made kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de wardes when he received the letter   17.791677385618318
replied d artagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed   10.715568166942818
louis au marais   12.162246694685118
what is the matter   12.335537783940417
the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed   10.717179444354835
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor   8.663684067938128
at what time you please sir replied franz   13.08658745550729
my father said the young man bending his knee bless me   4.42573047019514
they are robbers perhaps he muttered   13.119945155875337
that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlini s rear when he fell   6.4825088798884005
shall i send word to him as coming from you   11.899391495789454
albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him   8.278123523462538
aramis saluted then turning toward athos i don t care to camp on the place royale with all these people he said   6.246992117699783
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence   8.900756358541567
and will you direct us   16.219127729887582
good lord   17.035163940385154
nothing   13.671457927074483
he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall   4.004072761604215
but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasure s sake   10.945990075916166
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos   17.31201739283435
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter   11.819980832854135
cried de blacas   10.436399645934944
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me   6.844639069916266
and it was peppino you saved was it not   11.975409119848628
comminges began to laugh   12.004236770952378

of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry iv   14.050671880948604
monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned   13.1751906143284
for if i satisfy some i shall displease others   14.446355836343393
dear maximilian believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my father s commands it is more on your account than my own   4.06628221202117
i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares   16.771945652488554
oh sir   12.931142974753419
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak   9.257581948595362
doctor doctor   9.051235545104284
forsooth   15.751456894421182
beauchamp bowed and sitting down sir said he i just now accompanied m   14.720927003735483
then he let his head sink upon his two hands while d artagnan stood before him stupefied   5.085957691052679
but this planchet is so serious and important that i have not informed my friends that i would entrust this secret to you   17.927793546786656
mordaunt said mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare how extremely your history interests me   14.074702831839485
only leave him in the ante room as i wish to speak to you alone   10.98506518793655
it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale   8.395170471077128
meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of rocroy fribourg and nordlingen   10.090820837770043
for very important notes for which closer attention is required i pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own blood   18.58341268157994
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet d artagnan   10.956575870089777
and the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at louvres   14.67424576909653
well said the jailer are you more reasonable today   11.851814924460184
have you really no desire to meet him   15.842088135505959
monte cristo descended into the courtyard walked all over the house without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure until he entered his bedroom situated on the opposite side to the closed room   6.517716745592903
no   6.4214893975577505
read it   17.071450415076576
6   11.472994523135167
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared   10.578905035831998
the devil   12.781687340457648
first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard   11.438514266595673
oh pardieu less than nothing said aramis   10.064882939447969
i must absolutely see it   10.367433651152744

faith no   16.651947572089856
yes i will tell you all   8.473253784017476
the other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay   6.533741648031032
sire notwithstanding monsieur duke at whatever price it may be i will have them   13.034074337629738
and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said porthos   16.315813236134154
his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée when suddenly the door opened   18.587870069654507
ah capital said beauchamp   14.872364926137463
what   12.38029513236376
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions   18.667211004110992
mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked room she who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir   14.791247721712713
grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his eyes   5.284647775609363
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables   15.722098666935922
mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing   15.777029382430136
on my honor   18.880528983646546

30297m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count   9.44237088893309
you know that i am not alluding to you   13.820014497930568
monte cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name   12.857192817041447
at this injunction from his superior felton obeyed   12.826196536101769
then he advanced   17.419450798300023
d artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided   14.95935104680247
well ask your worthy jailer what favor i this instant solicited of him   22.03252230726636
from heaven replied d artagnan shaking his head   13.660044666120838
that s true said the procurator s wife groaning that unfortunate outfit   9.867432045414427
a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long athos will act   10.921431775128383
yes madame said the young man   15.98811427964055

they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity   11.095955730688464
the event was announced by the cessation of the firing   6.753112417310191
but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter see here it is   13.71163488992106

besides i care not for his displeasure   17.360854093276096
aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a dark blue cloak of a military cut   13.69867532060155
he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball room that valentine ran to him saying oh father some misfortune has happened   15.09275944805961
the mob dispersed   17.47058555622798
and i too   18.857618612056534
your eminence may be certain of that   17.0221417511102

an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury   16.068781664230357
the steward gave him a gun   10.611685308488507
a thousand francs   11.337740834476465
oh monsieur   10.193574965859398
replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple   7.617202153847904
yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m   15.835891024748587
suddenly d artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even porthos observed   13.42483679370607
in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind   5.410920963306842
who goes there   6.767730496732217
in the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance an enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves   11.51749211826323
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting   15.104951932332147

oh make yourself easy on that head said ali smiling   12.562280468839631
the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms   15.857147565029383
but for the sake of the mother   1.048199627694986

you are right madame and i will not finish   13.632579132259112
you prohibited my mentioning my father s name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips   5.456270385625539
yes   14.04424627721869
it was time   10.640029631566879
for i am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn   15.791414522347317
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge   7.713552221406497
he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore m   9.623955873507416
ah here is my mother cried the viscount   6.832445654546944

what is his name   15.721363546281292
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water   10.409808507630483
d artagnan thought it was proper to follow this example   4.49025260773846
dantès was beside himself with joy   9.726895284010043
you can not be mistaken   16.104061760365575
you understand   9.092139879563293

if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in   19.421033318851713
at first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year i became used to it   16.93869952439395
said the dragoon   9.87936376150993
happy on the contrary for what am i in want of   11.870397787136326
no everyone would do that   9.235728391654092
i was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained   14.164294247200136
you have a good memory   15.764535670021775
the carnival at rome   17.609559196780296
and why separate   17.685366701765467

dessessart s valet came to d artagnan s lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres   11.82428010816775
said d artagnan   10.177754219550955
she is besides my sole heiress   4.534621646668132
then let s count our money and divide it   3.1186479028791094
it is not he who plays   14.860234406091063

at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos   9.375042812373763
cried mercédès with an angry look at her cousin   10.27358747990659
but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings   13.379594205925647
cried anne of austria   11.977195425623584
he kept his word   12.060956615003555
that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest   8.245294873840447
cried he throwing himself on his horse   11.003850042234804
that is true   15.325619602405443
coquenard after the luxuries of such a repast which he called an excess felt the want of a siesta   7.9792996137906504
there is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed   17.277697695790685
cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen   5.21125677197777

the day after monte cristo had called upon danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten o clock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon   11.055912313118188
30123m so sir you lived at lucca did you   12.513615589020747

i killed the duke of buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain   10.379634233093705
next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested   12.767843283307565
franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to m   12.765516645773879
but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste   14.84511316018558

the leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage   11.937998762905128
but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness   7.517825936855667
e   14.598944560403023

that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness   7.7603683487768915
the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss   15.633655574081937
good   11.162045925251832
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris   9.934508973781005
but however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment   15.346580680160958
it was like having a spy in the enemy s camp   10.552289798732643
for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments   5.291951634010868
measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us   11.493848990192944
danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage   7.920985112929693
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur d herblay   5.792398591268539
planchet said he   16.651003206377183
he has been here since yesterday   5.976387570667541
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms   10.596501139792526
it is my duty as your host returned albert ringing the bell while lucien turned over with his gold mounted cane the papers that lay on the table   13.566474363207869
on the first floor   8.191315793062682
all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of d artagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done before   11.907062810984668
no one can be more so monsieur   11.368580710332626
no i want to live   7.876405861351071
there s a reason   12.299390925230366
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m   7.358378366736389
a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest   13.908146921978362
you may one day be the captain of a vessel   19.449313464765954
d artagnan s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract   13.073565698159163
i know how clear sighted your dreams are   15.237303203695246
but there was still another step to be taken   9.9081247627758
the wise unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing   18.320652408986692
and then i knew you were seeking me   6.481940393139792
they then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of m   24.104094072122848
said mazarin   12.818829476033404
yes repeated the executioner   2.2225889784218342
what can he be looking for   18.128835336467365
replied athos with a deep sigh   11.172000848684313
selim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali   9.739388079721193
yes and pretty tight too i can tell you was the answer   20.085608725637492
the same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m   11.17490654002921
only behind the guards the barricades were closed again   9.657493165352868
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags   10.139755031305409
for if i remember you told me you only expected two persons albert   8.275119600783608
look said he is it not strange   11.499746070896911
poor eugénie   8.397514734041486
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling   13.656286268288536
madame de villefort is ill   11.992279403791262
was that it   11.899411175188655
had just granted to him with his estate of épinay   15.289008262485156
the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest   17.653468572150338
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations   15.006236484366253
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer   11.463022392089995
my name is lady clarik and this measure this measure is general madame   15.610848545211633
they broke open the doors and searched the dwelling but in vain   7.948096470439802
murmured milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther   9.531808361255333
no   10.831482498035026
do not be alarmed m   8.42325156365414
what to do   10.254265717920857
yes yes indeed   9.90957418016607
said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer i sir   14.02565531709777
he drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her eyes   7.9679661668509585
said athos astonished   15.083856790957746
madame de chevreuse and madame de vendome have left their names at his door   21.302035447031194
and the corridor   11.375801419481938
oh i take everything on myself   12.496658871783549
but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace france   17.759839019611803
replied morrel   15.283722994397163
she questioned emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew   16.08311650406906
he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water   11.51806518065575
no said morrel   10.56940202336107
tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny morrel to pray sometimes for a man who like satan thought himself for an instant equal to god but who now acknowledges with christian humility that god alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom   9.382925851344178
mme   13.40732080051612
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted   15.521279217353825
i did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself before everyone came   10.277639691299985
and remember that two legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others   9.758962505430961
then read for yourself   5.605557650856277
to leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger   16.53768930368245
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you   13.02652703456623
he exclaimed   16.558936436257255
i will extinguish the fire with blood   18.404146392702913
d artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines   9.621342202529958
and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by selim   14.493440912764369
what man   14.356245893638668
are you quite decided albert   9.506453016865835
give it to me   13.895844888351544
having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again   12.440284948977895
your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment   17.195637356450558
i do not know   20.476827194191245
what is it   15.746756425991805
i denounce the crime   17.703616932026073
cries of down with mazarin   9.495626935841473
but to their great surprise he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other and filling it your health diavolaccio said he calmly and he drank it off without his hand trembling in the least   10.473202860908735
gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate   11.538057367682427
they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dantès could easily read it as well as make out the sense it being in italian a language he as a provençal perfectly understood   9.021517979568955
then i have engaged as my cook the cook who lived with lafollone you know the man i mean   10.323360700058622
oblige me by taking a seat said d artagnan pushing a chair toward mordaunt who sat down pale but calm   7.959379159710708
there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three   5.264614833680674
once within the interior of the court the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty five steps   12.84828284598204
in the midst of one of these swoons i heard the door open   6.979483709508819
then she ventured to ask what had become of felton   12.97847509470129
well oh speak speak doctor   13.474198669056676
it was an apparition   5.970629963522768
good evening m   8.863570026167924
but that is not in the country   14.753126609200748
if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense   10.476095877279185
oliver cromwell   11.471128108509397
chapter viii   11.183149104054664
i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses   18.361431783723976
how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame   14.151079823737996
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise   21.649627717107073
most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina while sleeping betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo   17.687414344306546
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria   14.622245026979547
who can say whether we shall ever see them again   12.93336300706133
you will assist me in the work will you not   6.8860654007362125
and what has procured me so flattering a distinction   8.24817949280552
you aramis   17.80330417308964
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other   13.001949184312918
there s liberty for all the world   19.439510074085305
in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them   14.030520617792847
13 paris   5.834071482746435
so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both   7.873139008184937
we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons   15.009075875624557
m   3.315946400736358
that you found me sad but resigned   9.6528372011323
then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort   7.698133389482416
i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here i am   13.652783512769615
but we owe something in this house   20.532854863836093
the host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney   12.368722996502147
cromwell had sent him to mazarin   17.239550817529302
oh monsieur said caderousse make one more attempt try me once more   18.964961826161005
well those studs continued mme   9.23352530048173
and the five and forty thousand francs inquired caderousse in a hoarse voice where are they   18.687762198989706
le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed   10.342616614871531
do you think you can behead me with a single blow   9.513242832303604
as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him   12.566810512678344
yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince   11.080118150554094
it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven   14.505612409361392
and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed   13.542501925135184
said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me d artagnan   20.820722048665345
said grimaud who had not spoken a word   10.392797188182413
cried the baron   12.036415789928489
a sun dial could not have shown the hour with greater precision   10.95058656535874
for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings   8.549073121715262
poor athos   17.83582046856612
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil   1.4401793663430862
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening   8.622758639843653
mme   11.00945055389364
in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all   11.766627467902225
bonacieux giving to his countenance a most sly air   15.400446645653691

noirtier   6.662353413976262
what i mean to say is this sir that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred excuse me said morcerf but is it a play we are acting   16.075235503890312
porthos looked at d artagnan in astonishment   17.276474132956015
i hope said d artagnan half dead with fright you made no mention of my diamond   9.342491226312175

by the side of the luxembourg   8.899944397195085
the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera   8.407854349108055
then athos looking into his friend s face and taking him by both hands said what ails you my lord   0.923115779565375
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand   8.95401380041351

cried raoul   12.639797688277586
the signatures were perfectly legal   14.842176610266598
your agreeable company will divert me   12.428814587566189

and yet notwithstanding he could still hear her cry and threaten   12.589118490799276
the devil   12.82665944236555
morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance   18.714896348316984
you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio   14.234963805730082
athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was painted   19.59775422286397
swear my son   8.368271991064233
you would be all the wiser said athos   10.749603463090427
oh death death   11.450392568569354

go on then i listen   19.008944047536023
towards the house the chestnut trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air   17.10397732008691
i tell you so to prove to you that i still hope   14.948695598018686
and the guide went out   1.0819688980345088
having staggered as far as the rue dauphine he perceived his carriage awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the faubourg saint honoré   11.558235972289285
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry i am very much in a hurry   7.475037608674882
but speak   19.651941046471116
no one asks for your secret all the world knows your discretion   6.029155834325165
both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battle field   11.84911046458255
good evening comrade said d artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner   11.80428704436655
the devil take you said aramis   15.015697295055322
but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive   13.734306946158922
the news caused a great sensation throughout the house   18.833437227711936

i have business in italy   16.70842910101772
i have no wishes count   12.99457051578298
suddenly the daylight began to fade away   21.435541762829594
there said d artagnan this is capital   12.494168820541173
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman   16.134088195077435
god   18.77637784412038
we will go on gentlemen said the queen   12.649526426170315
but what is to be done   8.310764210902475
dear maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably duprez is singing that line o mathilde   12.944221343512464
but tell me now count exclaimed albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo   13.206578084371477
infamous   13.859111080323434
why did you so awkwardly let it fall   14.181206002086673
what do you say to this project   7.137403899353121
was it ever known who this miserable fellow was   8.064490650606906
wait an instant   10.675079840591348
well be it so   7.4844243377356685
i am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the ground   11.910303569238142
will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you   12.216297917947939
he thought of his wife   9.113544222467604
50245m the path was wide but dark   11.390203337947813
i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter s hand   9.655511175261495
this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch   7.473258689620971
go young men   14.473408289600298
for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty   24.31832121560611
mother said albert with firmness   13.738694130345662
two feet of earth removed and dantès fate would be decided   20.29834166423271
louis xviii   12.901183257792578
if it is true he shall be free   11.373823579138206
let us die then as de winter has died   13.590926725967732
the blood mounted to the temples of debray who held a million in his pocket book and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women one of whom justly dishonored had left it poor with 1 500 000 francs under her cloak while the other unjustly stricken but sublime in her misfortune was yet rich with a few deniers   16.27791467083382
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter   23.478787164578147
not a thought was given to a life which you once mercédès had the power to render blissful   11.002005988602617
but the door closed   5.9296907761151925
d artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket here my friend write your name upon it and become my chief   16.873969591971807
a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators   10.739636253288827
how does this misfortune affect you   8.604623193594923
at the same time aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb english charger   11.621845878758585
do you know observed franz that with such stories you make me think of ali baba s enchanted cavern   16.329951507842452
de morcerf   5.399334843496575
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend   15.077920946443324
i   12.57424217086026
i have told my secret   14.02548748417054
oh   7.896394016345866
the postscript is explicit   16.439426857035187
d artagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace   6.755489590598153
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here   16.190209863063487
cried mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left   10.81646968448471

de villefort   5.663141148019995
you edmond on the contrary you are still young handsome dignified   15.02012381640354
i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body   12.821797316804842
yes quite   13.061411105739687
alas   13.254801565142007
well now tell your story penelon   11.999961902369172
you would love me as much if i were poor would you not maximilian   9.262322359976176
i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs an officer brave and handsome as a youthful caesar   6.618424944398584
besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum   9.830259952458267
he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking   18.392967674194953
inquired the other   13.730172071711552
the lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner   10.008168326272424
well try the hotel de luynes raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you   3.5105368176957867
yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone   12.244117234929575
half an hour s rest is enough replied the gascon   14.569110558169001
daughter of a prince i restore to you the riches and name of your father   7.917203982892907
it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it   14.176912336284222
hold your tongue said he and let me answer   15.00622736098677
one of the noble peers who was familiar with the arabic language having studied it during the famous egyptian campaign followed with his eye as the translator read aloud i el kobbir a slave merchant and purveyor of the harem of his highness acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor from the french lord the count of monte cristo an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand francs   8.523333211688225
has lamoricière that ney of the south been killed   12.501750308683324
dantès seemed full of kindness   20.721174454180705
at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franz s imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina   11.680449529428296
returned bertuccio in deep contempt   13.809147325785894
and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it   10.247545119990882
but i ought to be gone too   16.120143829966636
i promise it   11.16887774099062
monsieur the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said   10.021845811871877
for i am the only culprit edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude   16.983013022091548
to horse my friends to horse   17.38352658123853
the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead   20.031413599872586
you are right said the duke   13.092376303439536
but these advances could not go far with three musketeers who were already much in arrears and a guardsman who as yet had no pay at all   15.651641511458687
i do not speak for him but for myself   13.402171126984626
monte cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight   10.689213834237949
danglars turned to the left   13.933024792652242
she opened the door   9.599506889717194
the pharaon is entering the harbor   15.016130562779253
he ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boatman   11.938119250534141
monsieur baptistin especially   7.592503861980466
the poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter   10.288031188297104
i understand replied porthos   16.194253981154432
from time to time i hear of them indirectly but in what part of the world they are devil take me if i know no on my honor i have not a friend in the world but you rochefort   11.428522913448164
on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat   14.679679375704046
asked milady   11.48776431996052
0051m fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out   6.510582162363355
he did as he said   15.980862844533844
speak speak in heaven s name   18.05203373715615
the wine you prefer   12.186014540701848
it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke   22.831915548752704
i resist my father s order and my dying grandmother s wish   12.63750450848647
i can imagine the effect i do not see the means   9.889791140842547
i am free as a bird and have wings like one   14.065961579678413
there was no peculiar indication in any organ an excitement of the nervous system that was it   11.07255544390826
do you hear that   19.543053692954366
valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror   10.307981745853025
said danglars   10.637387372580784
and is the reason known   10.890270671353615
asked the cardinal   15.758115028845479
returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him   2.2656808297700106
so he s called mouston thought d artagnan   17.956677954693983
had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven   1.0013568186965607
someone has told you the secret   10.200559282040837
jesus seigneur   14.025047742384452
the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and i ask no more for my husband than has been done for me   13.870177077001
never more to be separated   7.506534284143781
at the expiration of an hour felton tapped again   11.74235774798743
de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be   12.602384315783388
but that is not a man s name   5.942933777505791
said he in a low voice   6.342332561307717
at my age they say that we have no more tears still i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping   10.242385593341204
the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of d artagnan if the wine had been bad   4.136208124914459
in a few minutes he had extracted three boards   10.93609947664064
still replied porthos   16.079386688615518
the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder   12.596653600806663
i have my sword   14.481236565900874
it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing   13.511304133736722
then bending again to raoul he whispered above all things do not divulge your name   5.133392872068209
it had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the scottish commander   10.441401128857818
yes replied anne but you know why and how i see you   12.86280160246196

yes you   12.034714919508346

yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end i wish to attain i mean the remission of my sins   9.119594768568572
the assizes also were about to begin and villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse   15.617719153871352
yes   19.248040158172707
well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clément or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france   9.38612473944004
i ran to the hospital and learned that the same night the night of the 20th of september a child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half   11.167590751624324
the young man s head fell on his breast   9.520041693331578
at all events it is neither you nor i   8.641497637130817
my god   23.01562644042344
into normandy if you like   7.082183796383526
again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head   16.835095531944347
i not only promise but swear it   10.284022213115682
god has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get free   13.012501363176574
the comte de rochefort   19.225015775666613
d artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket   10.932892602472842
the nephew replied no   15.228201319057515
these gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy   16.94234436182529
the house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage contract was going on   19.84995013950268
how could i know what i was the bearer of   7.9118430317769874
yes   9.345578582882828
it is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind   13.166620410400965
he approached her and said in a low voice has your majesty still confidence in me   8.52052935392367
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips   15.162046507156585
it does not bring him a bajocco   10.819636522869764
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day   17.465759344150033
he extended his hand   5.9115188098232645
m   20.308733635745263
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it   13.805472494303917
a fine and white stocking a silken robe a lace kerchief a pretty slipper on the foot a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty but they make a pretty woman beautiful without reckoning the hands which gain by all this   18.298920719408436
how soon can he be here   9.36337663991528
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time   20.75512827997966
capital   12.563483931117883
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him   12.810777101082781
what do you wish to say about it   2.5058865002289874
for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not repress   12.371856916549653
but to return to our duchess   6.514403542010816
i repent of it   10.635172133027261
a nobleman retired from service is he not   11.430132143132965
but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller s shop it is another branch of industry paralyzed   8.843585153501465
they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks   12.536638423486094
i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and forty eight hours to stay there   17.333623635347713

and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator   9.18500141552274
the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses french and rochellais   12.213604715693895
my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread   2.4127414700253276
it is his son   15.090992673459583
and twenty violins were ordered and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate upon condition said the report that they should be played all night   10.893066379054718
destiny   15.815516500682444
in consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before m   7.358300728037969
in the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in bed   7.5071474784286725
it will be time to think about it when we next halt   13.566856795622867
but you shall not kill me today   11.011619348665967
oh   9.536805488723164
night arrived   10.42565188681287
the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali should attend him   14.581993682652891
have you answered the question i put to you on entering the room   15.112439891025797
if there s any fighting where i m going must i fight   6.924750091848847
the officer seemed a statue   10.912748351619477
from seven o clock in the morning a crowd was stationed at the iron gates and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the privileged   10.769266790765165
we are four of us said d artagnan   13.264501702140926
that is natural enough   12.405885851222495
this time i too saw them said porthos   10.20657262667551
is that what you wish for   14.990943140811197
suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at vampa   11.95098203451863
what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth   11.236063836255404
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris   10.764105916083007
at last the half hour struck   5.553840285267168
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect   15.956541918435747
here   12.757401782420068
from that time he received all who came   10.723857027577223
nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed   14.79494111986048
i will give them to you   11.957396164218396
yes replied noirtier   9.715920022962779
asked richelieu   11.63321763971766
ah diable   8.961924078974363
gondy sprang to the window and threw it open   16.932970167259043
debray lives some distance from here   6.649928299154795
de tréville himself   11.699520190072242
you were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable   14.873125623706587
i madame   11.076360499493848
then in a low voice morrel added this delay is not natural   13.64617479024234
at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight   12.637531909605622
jacques de la boucherie   12.724471983120196
volume three 30009m 30011m chapter 48   16.608772436021347
no more money   18.473270058996
it was as we have said the 1st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness   15.829695549157758
nearly so   11.828613190389172
i recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me while i managed to stammer forth i did not do it   12.213309216630734
well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier   11.775422420745825
release broussel from prison and give him back to the people   16.828352480045588
what   15.893305718572426
be easy said d artagnan he will know all before night   5.382558191106898
you are coming to sup with me are you not   8.518519986940461
albert attributed to franz s absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask   15.0561234470599
however the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite   14.563786746976259
dantès entire dinner service consisted of one plate there was no alternative   8.666853967999486
but m   0.876543455124775
and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth and grasped the old man s senseless hand   13.612460860326195
no thank you   14.964154886808334
i must try and persuade m   12.37162741251884
did i tell you that i wouldn t serve any other   14.282961332980033
p   15.498974364072138
oh my god   12.36144758643215
scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight   14.995706347514366
m   10.372808640955489
sir said he here is monsieur d artagnan s answer   17.190472035082287
then in a last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the floor   8.587804308189073
valentine   14.714025976950957
selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey   16.048477633489206
said blaisois   8.62355194792088
the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century   17.860065041445402
i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about   16.00156945208506
the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished   10.530108065654249
experience had taught him the importance of past events   12.782197525040647
it was only inhabited by a guard kept there for the prevention of smuggling   8.077293103138114
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children   10.4267808756173
well sir replied eugénie i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible   16.398289398178346
chapter 59   16.75760669891466
i dare say you have nothing else with you   11.882691103338303
said danglars enraged   15.313403450923865
that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead   10.128566556955597
the shutters were only opened to admit a minute s air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice will there be another funeral today at the procureur s house   8.372240229460726
if i like   3.9307723806126376
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse   12.585145220097234
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money   18.64839131230549
he kept his word   11.961611334583793
and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady   12.194008950369135
i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there   13.957050360400968
do you love me still   8.751271167628158
coquenard understood it   9.925766363715342
you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son   11.003159674494599
you will not accept my gold   15.202050504866737
yes   11.911722012436037
now madame said debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about 60 000 livres a year which is enormous for a woman who can not keep an establishment here for a year at least   18.924993187337233
give me your arm then   12.719898787565512
although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other   11.523531397675265
about fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad perthshire dialect   8.52733413639309
coquenard whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table   17.724519937853895
we have i think a private room in the piazza del popolo   14.124400281554339
besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the luxembourg   9.048687447357587
the pleasure of seeing you   12.829710129199752
at the second he reminded her that he loved her   6.246671419076295
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed   9.393382635510083
afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage   8.525498182812765
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine   18.886020172375492
to prevent recognition said d artagnan   5.43873933969049
no   14.539994522360768
perfectly   8.303734124631656
i see you know him exclaimed the wife   19.403678664509368
in bringing the horse out to the water they ve allowed him to walk over the border   18.12655826709974
and you assisted and took part in this great battle bragelonne   11.263576212633165
they passed the barrier without accident   13.8797489821232
all at once he raised his head   19.372843378312606
then turning to the young man he exclaimed a fine prize   8.35833424284951
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united   11.392675350001
said mme   8.288802310060113
and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain   7.17776530507368
do you repent   12.296648680626767
lemonade was a very bad thing for him   10.411435382135274
he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the lorraine party as well as from the spaniards upon the arches of notre dame   11.404176099347428
well   20.02265447636757
he turned round   13.978954768385364
yes returned morcerf a baron of a new creation   4.893625516279005
mazarin reflected   11.281795429369232
yes   17.143136240319194
why does she love what we hate most in the world the spaniards and the english   12.581809457686774
andrea turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible   19.45154284654143
not when it comes from a friend   15.361213491756907
mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace   10.420000006313899
not for a time but forever   4.926977787878821
but on arriving at the kitchen the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage drawn by two large norman horses   8.158646922608341
keep them until you are liberated   6.423196692624029
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy   12.810923396645826
and with regard to the past   3.2562819940371135
he again arose and went to the door   3.309361237484863
50189m oh   9.875576523989515
i thank you for having recognized me sir   11.987873341483395
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champs élysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel   15.764972048809899
and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us   9.096772987978216
the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white   10.900964466264206
only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour   10.748011947540892
no   16.657064920467405
to kill the turnkey   15.283918607231396
byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them   10.559475350333908
de tréville entertained good company wholly anticardinalist though   16.393028648760808
why   15.327893661395768
nevertheless replied mordaunt i could compel you   14.552874774337209
the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight   8.106461104393862
it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle   15.931546317926056
you can speak before me said franz   11.364306218216253
yes my dear boy replied the old man it is very fortunate   16.94384882984808
mercédès let them fall and sighed   12.216869326913393
ten minutes after he raised his head   19.79301250035259
was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house   8.176508708940545
no reply   12.743239410132725
the horses will have a long night s rest and at five o clock to morrow morning we can be again on the road   12.154137571917598
should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side   5.89003073647931
i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle   8.292982903331659
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence   21.640966264577138
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and i come back still more weary and low spirited that s all   14.42246003368818
they asked a thousand livres for him   18.081140951636026
i will never confess that but to the man who should read to the bottom of my soul   18.301922547302887
i have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours and by tomorrow at midday i must be in london   9.94044613610138
go said he quickly   11.507134666182315
and i will get you the torch you ask for   12.624962495457636
the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary   14.153878029995845
he has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns   14.634522905128822
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today   13.791447213743643
and as he said it was an ancient name   9.756165058141185
a child s reason i repeat it continued mousqueton   20.39578946166587
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe   14.848249283988796
it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle danglars is a handsome girl   9.368643170344088
that he was living on a small estate but where   9.246434715216026
i expect you tomorrow morning at nine o clock   9.856592517327039
you are a very odd man athos he replied to doubt me thus   12.191613438552695
unfortunately the general s valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number   18.095267700112245
let us not even here speak thus of him   9.36387210519495
yes   16.236555219460698
but as i maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed d artagnan could not restrain a smile   9.168318168269728
it shall be   14.381306867435438
i did not seek one i did not ask for one   13.618658369002208
sir what gratitude i feel   12.023445035400545
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken   16.858287566906004
where is the letter you speak of   14.226855203595868
de guémené   7.583066572071339
de boville feared to lose   14.160331179571878
i will not abandon buckingham thus   15.460645944269517
are you mad emmanuel   8.531321288967021
you do not know him   12.202327915744323
i will accompany you   14.566851253923835
said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment i understand english then   8.334187963457264
for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself   17.615360578115833
yes   12.599049563641156
what is his name   9.707313353659309
did anyone introduce you to him   9.3251517208065
besides i have promised him your patronage   13.446774332896931
if the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem   16.442663186998708
murmured renée   5.1831826451826375
i prefer going sir   9.684191817506921
do you know my dear villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries when questioned by his majesty s principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condé   10.650066817853652
eagerly demanded all his three friends   11.64444716204866
do as you like with them   7.9723750228699295
de boville   9.956904250832403
he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard   12.702718711932096
i thank you d artagnan   7.401819755425555
it is a beautiful diamond left by poor edmond dantès to be sold and the money divided between his father mercédès his betrothed bride fernand danglars and myself   10.953866010266049
a letter   14.755204357372353
if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said d artagnan i shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavy for with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like   8.901538895623924
gondy bit his lips   15.478888660633142
d avrigny s door   11.723948316094065
but does he know this secret then   10.685970375468163
reflect then wretched man and repent   20.559817355515804
when the hour of breakfast came therefore i did not hesitate to eat and drink   3.95349976341868
you are irritated and vexed tell me how this fernand is related to you   18.18747108471579
at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart strings   6.980335230776852
good day penelon returned morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain   12.792414563018532
mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it   13.467071558713762
and i also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sister in law   11.379425382416784
locusta chapter 102   10.7901933547652
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians   8.616167712831581
you will go to marseilles said dantès for you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them   15.383928311624015
in which world   9.627701469557305
then it will be but charitable to inform him   13.318894931265744
the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs   9.888952320047594
never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon m   8.679001152103867
the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m   11.573594835446988
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men   14.255543174131056
why should they not   10.040379193231697
the count looked around him   17.348766110907306
de villefort passed on to his own room   19.93136399923269
ah this time cried d artagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me   12.60026014713538
and then said monte cristo this is not all   20.319181414786833

but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs which make one die of laughing   12.198695295775606
he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection   24.398325625292003
your bills at least are the first that will fall due   10.12441627116711
who knows but that in order to please madame de villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power   10.638592187993659
said caderousse   9.915839558928502
i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on   11.93875595150393
well sir said d arminges it is the common lot   12.880385750569337
no more than a drop of water in the ocean   7.994095856136761
so that he related to me how in the plains of the pampas the natives hunt the tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety   14.112539370420105
what are the wishes of his eminence   9.254308886952245

the event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas   3.238699474632419
it was an ambuscade   12.83232306106154
de monte cristo and myself   5.306624713874957
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken   11.700991888447902
cried d artagnan   8.40294028789858
at the foot of the staircase de winter stopped   13.223190690515604
their joy was great   3.9416577150568077
the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey   11.981375239430287
hold your tongue imprudent man   1.3792967414882025
very well   17.88193175208366
yes replied porthos coughing   16.868814917523352
antoine he turned round to look gaily at the bastille   12.843103055334664
he was put in a dungeon   6.783416845539232
but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory   11.744919575248252
did you pass through the corso   12.234602638344642
and for whom for some grisette some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some garrison   10.57165452351949
well you may be assured that your horse will not be half so serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis   6.9588482468233455
the salon was filled with the works of modern artists   11.200596579812983
grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier   11.40003398238142
and you are going to portsmouth   12.213494671519864
how did it arise   7.216923505983208
but to return to what you were saying beauchamp   15.802440027635107
it was i the comte de la fere said athos rising and bowing respectfully to the duchess de chevreuse   18.60224643806292
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you   17.64835281355207
you received me very coldly   8.41333017558977
mazarin shook his head   20.71979420097322
if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady said athos coolly it is useless   11.00802789829797
said madame de chevreuse hastily   8.283176019364031
come there can not be too many   10.119301968761311
d artagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed   15.759097514559201
what has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied d artagnan   3.705322587279472
there is your proud and selfish nature   11.690822224692432
but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite   14.610012076772568
my god how agitated you seem   9.92527500957855
morrel looked obedience to her commands   12.084301110624674
and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there   9.428975819829681
so you may plainly see tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked   5.923483566998118
strange   7.352531911733
yes said beauchamp   11.632800493027732
save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when i may be able to thank you myself   13.245932397000804
i will now go up into my apartment   18.377762045350806
my dear friend you guess well   7.831074061097852

faith   14.223787718423942
well my dear porthos said d artagnan that s the very thing it came into my head to do   14.967675695338256
to day look around you and it may astonish you that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life i have only lord de winter the friend of twenty years and you gentlemen whom i see for the first time and whom i know but as my countrymen   13.747766196667808
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before   18.036679144635062

we are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark   16.54606793891717
he only changed his sword hand and fought with his left hand   8.791773483688221
we had thus at aigues mortes martigues or bouc a dozen places where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom house officers   17.60916817852432
but would you ruin me   12.058001051158545
was the reply i can do that when we get there   18.264993006517557
the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely   12.556743594381983
oh make haste and tell me then   16.233863657360075

as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him   9.913675613572256
and madame de beauvais undertook to prepare anne of austria who was in her oratory with the young king louis xiv   12.30055136982427
you have befouled the face of your king   16.46397055701872
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so d artagnan saw that he became pale   9.412422818017646
after my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man i shall hear you with pleasure sir   16.957340546494777
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape   7.4823688924845575
drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the apartment   10.544716728302394
and the cardinal m   13.172639019559005
come courage   6.721476056638149
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken   19.00852103346028
we owe nothing to our enemies   11.540022481857202
a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour   9.695807163351644
but what could these men whom i at first took for robbers want with me and why is monsieur bonacieux not here   17.82044885657504
9 when they tell me such things i only shrug my shoulders and say nothing   10.164842200069058
one of my brothers is about to die and i come to prepare him   11.445681998248208
there are ten men to accompany you   9.18398854627083
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye   15.05063834113774
certainly   5.952242100812425
and here i am said the sergeant   14.739132886817881
if i were a monk i should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too   9.698895723423592
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead   11.78578292569662
yes yes yes   16.799983263327082
you have not deceived me   10.694639437627309

de château renaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all over that is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemart took albert s hand   18.349372226313804
what do you mean beauchamp   11.029271675213957
he reached the hedge and hid himself behind it   19.09339506364705
oh   12.059407045071747
the count bowed   5.066493789565954
75   10.60023159584338
but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust   11.085414063615445
ah   18.19711533594827
no no be easy on that score   9.04226601685786

the prince bowed low   13.328598018286769
is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere   15.117034496962143
i am going a few steps farther   11.883676516165457

after some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by athos   7.567951937003982
30323m what are you drinking dear grandmamma   10.433522801662443
and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears   15.778784151251138
20081m oh they are simple enough replied the host   6.90203487457527
the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands   8.797013819859744
there were sicily pine apples pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis   14.36802546059128
said d artagnan getting into his saddle   12.356003322355162
the bell of monte citorio which only sounds on the pope s decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal   8.173866073534576
she worries me in england as well as in france said athos   12.324661244158467
if you wish i will inquire   4.757383365721326
and mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular inspection   10.449914018844261
and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over   16.225242433380284
you mean then that if i leave you haydée i should die   14.420037647982134

they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother of pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor   21.951992440671084
noirtier s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villefort s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man s heart   22.941238271816914
speak on   15.663595374597596
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthos s horse and that of d artagnan   16.075991524929606
but all this will come to an end tréville will come to an end   19.88407424899629

formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman   13.60416409420744
franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal   10.230523835269542
fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference   16.05455000500348
on entering his hôtel m   18.19493635947593

yes   14.568246935390432
what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition   15.969062625209352
nothing ambiguous if you please   15.32094386018599
oh i repeat it edmond   12.306296986706537
the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance   13.08477994685571
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained   10.504656617533382
monsieur abbé you are a great moralist   17.36759987883445

madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard   12.028532147987017

you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude   17.31177797270916
leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of montlhéry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name   15.498446164194132
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear   19.838000152340356
so it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and la ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster   14.139450020610601
said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i can t keep on my legs   7.77416292079637

at the end of a moment s conversation in which porthos hinted that a lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his embarrassment mousqueton entered   13.735412782082598
calm and dignified said he   9.761679172400772
at his mother s ball he danced once with eugénie and m   8.828038156627258
lightning darted from his eyes   15.141987004003592

anne hesitated   11.924642362105564

the three presents of d artagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april 1625 the market town of meung in which the author of romance of the rose was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it   10.955998546538279
franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting place and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui   13.653373256526086

he left his address as he had done before and set off again at the same pace for pontoise   19.12958083405491

in a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a cloak   2.542822187756771
repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead   13.098933774180699
morrel was announced   15.906063434393284

mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all   9.135786933001604
then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès   19.34088651873598
now as these street arabs of rome more fortunate than those of paris understand every language more especially the french they heard the traveller order an apartment a dinner and finally inquire the way to the house of thomson french   9.209936652031313
she said   18.2100358862813
on beholding this house d artagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heart so powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth   6.355368516787692
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted   14.876286200888163

as he had seen milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving england he suspected that it was almost without a doubt on account of the diamond studs   18.79543807225058
m   13.058335861181844
and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant   17.39295768564715

look   12.077535438828596
anne of austria lowered her head allowed the torrent to flow on without replying hoping that it would cease of itself   11.196165719928779
the closet into which d artagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see   14.283752036005016
foils boxing gloves broadswords and single sticks for following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandy s education i   18.665020892312103
madame said he with dignity there will shortly be a ball at the hôtel de ville   9.825552739038436
horrible   9.995358891374188
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand   10.401528808358709
raoul didn t wait to be told twice   11.270424191775042
he delayed presenting himself at morrel s but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him   10.40738281930465
oh lord no   15.36048270029928
we must trust in god   12.27123485071562
and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur d artagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron   7.4540777338756286
said porthos   8.633260089734787
but monsieur does not tell you silence with respect to me silence with respect to my friends   11.1633756244721
if i am in fault i will avow the error   7.918933252042752
he said   18.078533391676913
2 impossible   9.623182405604952
milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the count s   13.588781933740195
and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden   10.141533664998244
is it not true aramis   13.621534114335256
d artagnan was radiant with joy and pride   9.196831639150307
instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper s reign   19.757578914828912
at these words he blew a whistle   9.950834867555784
gracious heavens   17.828899134842043
in gascony tis no dishonor sir nobody is rich   14.97814004498216
20143m and you will probably find your theme ill chosen   19.019224857618962
no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians   9.201964620047196

d artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side   21.08757688239362
the insult chapter 89   8.75341037384479
do you wish it known that you are interested about him monsieur le comte   12.739177959343197
the two gentlemen were exasperated   7.150684538144291

danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the fowl   9.78742529546506
unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead   13.563179463368868
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo   9.030206437112067
i know nothing about it myself   7.573837062846538
hollo   20.87070174408112
whither would you have me go without friends without money in a part of france with which i am unacquainted and where i have never been before   17.004624405482616
the hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table   10.82841355752049
what are you going to do   11.447035530753674
all that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words i poured out upon this man   21.839047321754343
no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and d artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever   14.805996360185777
have you monsieur le gascon   8.28866718658402
ah   10.957853338276921
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly   4.349589072029987
it was about four o clock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant out of doors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern   10.151527687505405
he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action   16.285875220760747
why so   9.973726055482008
monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence   12.832701307308346
and seeing that m   21.198717282197688
really   10.150886888665104
madame replied gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition   18.20757099925257
cried the duke   17.66682499564895
no on the contrary we shall not answer   18.352593991732547
madame de saint méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to her   14.632676074278391
one   14.252218933268267
you no doubt stand in need of repose and i will withdraw   8.600685471095796

danglars do you not maximilian the banker whose horses ran away with my stepmother and little brother and very nearly killed them   9.356972348543309

himself   7.198078011530022
the meeting chapter 91   16.01723768346535
during this time porthos played close   10.048401879314994
but otherwise he has so little time to pass in paris and consequently to spare to us that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure   15.272361401724469
then addressing d artagnan you know the watchword   6.409977129938664
tis not one man not athos only not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you   9.729661630935835
it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of   9.691669146030046
yes i know it said the soldier   7.139917965856596
his mother the councillor s old servant opened it   15.176955891957682
and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment   16.85893375106362
de villefort who lives in the faubourg saint honoré   12.461348564680776
why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money   16.154498003047713
the superior education of dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy   14.279666855921663
help   10.821256300340291
i know only one other woman who can do it as well   4.068320323689676
remember your promise   14.464719221616138
and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble   7.798576517021556
the swiss began to laugh boisterously   6.974205604680861
i can work then   15.171538254966368
someone is talking in the street   3.224607076991802
we do conspire as your eminence might have seen the other morning   10.721817940445627
which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned d artagnan   7.473842356479316
they seemed to understand each other so well said monte cristo with renewed energy   17.28525783310772
but the son will be here   12.437367157177388
yes   18.889043001640193
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door   13.21049159351686
madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying what a singular event   11.438176941799496
indeed   15.761830923629677
his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul   16.5186929484599
said valentine   12.054862080911855
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth   13.591088003239705
certainly   20.796549828095465
i can sir said haydée drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed   14.62471654888274
you guess well   5.3559643175415665
go up when you are ready and sleep well   11.743965562245878
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so   11.54656176751814
felton and he addressed patrick the duke s confidential lackey at the same moment   9.042271485356876
this immediately recalled to d artagnan s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme   16.431617895376355
he came to demand five millions at once which i paid him with checks on the bank   20.77624105862234
oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them   14.790484892507965
be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear to me from the moment i am not obliged to see an enemy in you   23.569164053539623
she heard the count s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity   7.068856771661175
but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him and for the first time in his life d artagnan who had till that day entertained a very good opinion of himself felt ridiculous   13.051341710630128
he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them   17.403603355901154
he wishes to die alone   9.738953443476749
listen when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive   8.098321291938895
adieu abbé said the coadjutor i am to preach to morrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening   13.766463032423916
no no never   7.83446827528745
he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word   12.187247406050476
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still   11.334373901350656
leave me i pray you   10.532497628655738
i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed   8.303100842280173
yes   19.02795263303624
at this moment the tumult was heard nearer   14.517099602410692
but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto   21.23849104631139
yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied eugénie   19.25857933942199
you know him   17.165138046175205
can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties   10.145131166672455
no   14.138697596085137
they quitted paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine   11.68499477600901
not before i have killed you poltroon   9.834630977167489
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her   14.513862431761202
at present i no longer think of it and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government   7.8244640938693895
ali appeared   8.840318995798949
it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another   13.861510466378993
for in that case i shall demand of his majesty permission to plead for him   13.098930934581439
some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more distinct   10.528053446492098
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé   12.5808097707651
but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son   14.709692850706546
but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this account   2.3771217462623557
drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it   14.664287395206912
no   19.85070742156268
but as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing rooms   12.015781254699426
at ten o clock felton came and placed the sentinel   15.608792192605081
i give you a thousand chances   11.183484689072834
by choosing two of the greatest personages of rome especially rich men this was the return the holy father looked for   7.758603214828916
he had a deep set penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast   7.139242618501528
i will give you three months ere i join you   14.856393539319791
to repeat these signs   15.064277732879848
i undertake all that concerns the king   7.150230682053004
mazarin and guitant conversed together in whispers   19.508099637075603
and you monsieur aramis   12.978677079427252
listen my friends said the count i may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years the discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know   12.284989495027745
you were   21.513283851237404
she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for her   7.75069458636156
i have not done so   19.14118639012633
it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful horses   6.54183880251246
they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery   9.69588470100975
is she french   6.517637030593401
m   14.63622097026224
said the landlord   18.44320164197994
if i should not be in wait for me   15.794789397249248
said he   10.482243047680946
the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean see plutarch s life of scipio africanus   16.750648893250588
inquired caderousse   12.127902250060618
does the cardinal refuse to receive the king   9.776576518383242
albert could not understand the banker s look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectly did you see said he how he looked at me   9.531163568434902
and when is he to be married   15.8813750048736
cried d artagnan my letter of recommendation   11.390023358555727
he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london   14.887606712204871
oh go on monsieur go on   9.888557264210236
he shouted again   18.42008481893544
that is in strict accordance with the spanish character   14.92286560414886
de morcerf   13.11992656221241
a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile   7.2928300020136145
tell me what i must do this time   15.860762988674725
you know him then   11.306510891892763
when this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women alone   14.73586469668513
ten curious heads were glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury   17.523337851364786
and maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls one fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow   15.020836453453507
scarcely had the door closed when m   3.516177851342233
so they said   12.913445595545817
well said milady i have not seen our gascon this evening   9.690132988199018
the door at last opened   19.416912058114548
but this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude   13.655908833315378
said d artagnan half rising and bowing   9.36082052821899
exclaimed raoul here you are at last   8.92733995200894
it was not your opinion that i asked said the queen sharply without even turning around   20.106901182804286
murmured the count   15.438759262267105
oh i am already grandly recompensed   12.4772976079311
d artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away raoul whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot and who wished positively to strike a blow for one party or the other   7.13497966820418
but madame morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper   7.129793426802342
the more this young man was superior to others the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him   5.454615199038446
vicomte come here said athos   13.9770277890983
i detest him   10.618334343204836
nothing absolutely nothing at present but quitting paris as i told you as soon as possible   17.863384907239695
the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman   18.248079369976523
said andrea we must overtake him soon   8.854712173858417
it is he whom we must warn   11.185993467951366
then she broke the silence to cry out you are cowards miserable assassins ten men combined to murder one woman   11.732615887858824
but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble lest i should not merit it   11.321755429806304
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactor then count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend   13.806359073348055
you did not let the executioner escape then   13.060178378215152
what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you   15.94478753854648
what name did you pronounce then madame de morcerf   6.3620787283870746
replied monte cristo astonished in his turn   8.880855736790712
i am the abbé faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this château d if since the year 1811   12.790878604766286
although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m   17.42375112167489
at the manner in which felton laid the book upon the little table near which milady was sitting at the tone in which he pronounced the two words your mass at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them milady raised her head and looked more attentively at the officer   11.879586878052388
d artagnan pressing his hand repeated his call   16.328745731596122
god gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you   10.63564493223615
he has some but he is very avaricious   9.921674959019985
but to return to our millions   14.488802639441637
than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion   5.69367752584052
so much the better   15.487253964393604
yes but calumny seized upon all those follies in which i took no part as you well know my lord   15.291394898584475
it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays   19.5361108214871
yes monsieur i must   9.197901463080719
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities   10.9350976800086
cavalcanti   12.654257935174254
you must die   14.641438184018856
comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery   18.63844033274899
de wardes   11.901454288025569
athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier   9.498089243257803
this address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand   12.470066732751423
oh it is no trouble to spend that   8.136390856115082
let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone   17.323961814511915
what of that   16.8850578333085
here i shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my death   10.600163366263738
1   14.306034485705746
monsieur monsieur cried mazarin you are breaking your word to me   10.31503783796754
what are you doing reverend sir   16.056554031164925
there was a dispute among the guards   14.253328664004927
they have abducted her added the commissary   12.884369835032006
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a volcano an extinct volcano before the days when remus and romulus had deserted alba to come and found the city of rome   6.340548858731056
cromwell s letter   10.220260187860902
ah   17.18678389095857
monsieur aramis become a poet i beg of you   11.46333622817736
she found milady with a smiling countenance   15.01969447705904
be easy i am a gentleman   10.617317501467467
your horse seven against eight   19.86587627948645
where do you come from   8.111591732043216
meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example   5.619889310855589
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something   11.442160098700283
your eminence may believe added d artagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants   14.209314609735644
think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of us   9.631884497321739
the former life of the prisoner his transformation a review of his life from the earliest period were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur   22.327419846371843
asked milady   3.4265345022224185
asked the guardsman with the same jeering air   15.787619353920777
because i am too young to die   8.156261080902834
for iron nerved as you are you must need repose   8.592434658024715
d artagnan cast a glance around him   19.041200743437027
the person to whom you were conducted yesterday   10.453863243468598
she departed last night   9.791741960771976
i will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our conversation   13.042058723039533
he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie   15.452011286211151
i do not know but he wishes to speak to you   14.083171985123652
in the rue de seine he met planchet who had stopped before the house of a pastry cook and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most appetizing appearance   5.71980654847576
you had only read a line or two said d artagnan   14.407769165945819
what is it   10.451290748840616
franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction   11.269677046062434
the councillor placed himself at the window   17.42043224419644
i am waiting for no one replied d artagnan who was beginning to be angry   16.16801778900223
you have not returned that visit and you were wrong   16.503487400949396
where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council   7.563293100113946
she rose   10.719422571614889
impossible madame impossible murmured felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this argument   13.397800991026287
murder   10.031305203420203
certainly sir   10.85883988596475
oh maximilian how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness   7.7383025243638714
asked danglars of monte cristo   11.767340325057795
in the name of heaven   13.880926634878413
you knew him returned the inspector with a smile   14.458318575535962
and i was just asking the same question of albert   12.526854148501812
by whom   11.577196496097912
50279m an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel   13.346690510311708
as to porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily known   11.632093685316326
morrel i shall have his place   8.359121286472641
yes   14.457008779643449
by the way said the major you know i have only the 2 000 francs which the abbé busoni sent me   3.476640126710521
i don t think he put the faucet in again   9.665025125905474
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it   6.325011869418105
say it then   11.174624470050956
now i can not be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who can not speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance can not be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and can not be legally exercised   9.923297067769878
de villefort said louis xviii   12.108508287341591
porthos put his back into the sheath   12.687856842414039
you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairs on the expulsion of don carlos   9.361952014484551
seek then my lord seek these gentlemen   13.273639781791045
let him pass   15.509087223944432
we did not see her monseigneur said athos   14.370236237855826
the first to return will recover his chamber   13.427843880984527
d avrigny who ran to valentine and raised her in his arms   12.586288878481575
on this paved yard are to be seen pacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadows the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharpening   8.631042985000565
mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like automedon of antiquity   9.736437704013772
d artagnan smiled for he understood that athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret   10.327431070335543
she was within three steps of the bottom   7.318328417083085
a prisoner at vincennes   20.987535228509287
in consequence after having traveled all night at seven o clock she was at the fort of the point   11.548508038350905
smiling as he uttered the word   10.584983553143712
besides we will have no words about it   13.739228305176455
said monte cristo   7.513847104855712
are all these crimes committed on his account   14.61357783584426
baptistin   9.860084096644517
and that one thing your lost child   10.229940614932802
at last his patience was exhausted   17.742298036551425
he had no time to draw from his holsters   17.984363664577998
we will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said d artagnan and share the three hundred   16.567087243905096
i will enter a cloister   12.973268680021201
we must never look for discretion in first love   13.393185706399082
all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you   14.556100861549131
for the man we are looking for is the chief   8.769331251341796
i believe that i alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful war   10.911581283106413
speak madame   18.39274275720919
i made myself some   12.327914717111598
on the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious   11.807074030617068
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending   14.73923221535819
exactly   12.605110617108098
so that you will remit to me these 48 000 francs   13.819123555850068
stay here is another louis for you   9.97822233687345
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault   7.596738634494776
but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them   14.667027369466421
i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me   5.571799001089219
the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques   14.425581591412207
you alone forewarned us of the evil   10.001124281286003
ah indeed   6.287168656503434
50227m what have you to offer to me my friend   17.10460531284727
the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster   10.733806211705907
athos walked about in a contemplative mood   12.886362383937604
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description   16.959799128763077
alas   10.489184549744495
his fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king   8.395112665248641
it really seems to me very curious   8.317867620899143
yes my captain   14.617630952632378
you will hear me to the end my lord   9.706670770120517
asked d artagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery   13.629009811732764
he is i think the son of general d épinay   14.4992741540911
and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes   17.213469934189607
if what you say is sincere replied athos he will never reach london   14.044033835106998
debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain   15.06962297870966
the same had been done for the queen and madame the president   13.33165227635946
but happily for you you serve an all powerful master   7.8513843809812895
yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge   8.396349007545584
the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of de luynes   7.9890680223229165
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge   11.107680405245535
franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian   19.989607285829315
i have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood   16.521660558157908
the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery   13.197241342528596
oh let us speak of it   18.168095678706422
do not forget your crosses   13.094751449903402
believe me as long as i live i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me   9.587200322574613
this however doesn t concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me   11.647228784911912
he knows that we were sent from france by monsieur mazarin   11.755271678847299
will you drink some of this ether and water   14.23463538116425
oh heavens   7.127754439811078
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near   11.638658223456376
ah   16.295356219622086
her first trial was lost   19.528987995832825
guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier   11.037033488837912
section 3   11.57354122084958
and here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse   11.565219981568509
i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse   12.865614942459757
i have known a man much more unfortunate than you morrel   13.803355612787481
so much the better for him he will suffer less said the inspector   16.626503062203437
what is it   17.115928534347415
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him   11.061683834803096
lead us grimaud   3.96921255295368
the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian   16.1152147160093
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers   2.716631326778833
but your excellency wished to know two things   14.389951147535674
1   5.724739273484617
d artagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others   16.381712341329205
what does your worship want   9.115429051466096
very good   14.421666919985793
well   10.922425462255294
whip   8.793955469166537
does she belong to the family of the celebrated agrippa the friend of henry iv   9.544878258073545
the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs   11.603242374139679
the king saved we shall assemble our friends together we will head the puritans reconquer england   6.574574115880302
but said debray to beauchamp if i spoke to the president you must have been with the procureur   11.582527395606425
alas murmured edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse   16.600497484006745
but please god it won t be much and you will see him in a few days all alive and hearty   18.605250899025357
what relics are those by which you swear   11.812388905044171
only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner   9.30009216457802
albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword   12.933487282976618
will you examine them   5.374288575518105
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity   12.709824831460756
i shall entertain whatever may happen said d artagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your eminence for that which you now do for me   4.991124868193007
and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in work   16.04780270193835
in fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that i think monsieur de comminges must be mistaken   9.684363752524813
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society   15.550677864545698
yes my lord   6.488359174814682
is monsieur aramis with d artagnan   22.231270140534477
but his confidence in grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance   19.023183060231922
polish up or make some one else polish my arms   13.31760911482592
you shall take him with you there   12.9373776567417
you will not allow that   8.210303781956322
this note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his confinement   18.771963442759052
and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise   9.241001990444454
but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than any   11.846997493182748
morrel good worthy man said caderousse   11.264753393798731
journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in company   18.777443584457664
look at monsieur du vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage   10.148418100525559
it is your new master my good fellow said the footman   15.808762287394716
said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness   9.261222329678567
these three musketeers shall follow us said he in an undertone   15.311115418210157
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry   14.86743369041351
then you will see   17.844616863824676
now then do you wish for anything else   11.487858943563051
and don t you play too when you are on guard   11.721987558140283
asked d artagnan   7.970414888577751
morrel can not give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it   17.401491543660814
but jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to yield   9.734528673968942
monsieur bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in france   15.811048010267658
he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says   14.725553000611818
it is charming let them finish one moment   11.85980887426323
d aiguillon marion de lorme and several other gay women   9.859813075764036
mazarin groaned   5.303919891694682
what is to be done   7.607265647339435
even to his horse monsieur   15.42229124846428
did i not tell you i wished for one   12.92396030598804
not being of a race of historic fame like the de courcys who were content to be plain sirs or the rohans who didn t wish to be dukes all these people who are all either vicomtes or comtes go before me at church in all the ceremonies and i can say nothing to them   4.793875273723361
and yet what   15.908529411985587
the youth looked pleased   10.924617504002885
but mark the distinction with which he is treated   11.855507419317227
the two young men he announced were indeed approaching   9.881874794997564
are you really frightened madame   17.91720954535479
say it my father   18.291871661621325
additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg™ license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work   16.585136196796384
if i were a man that would barely be possible   7.430243006970894
have you forgotten that m   12.123272996499836
the officer took bonacieux by the arm and led him into the antechamber where he found his two guards   11.05348743007045
he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor   8.207751854918797
beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak   15.141389239426628
the cardinalists were three   8.143423715982648
not at all said château renaud slowly   1.359753325475813
it is my will morrel   18.01355319941774
and d artagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected   17.173187368306966
when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers   14.751878604096358
these two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed   9.818599911702787
the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy   10.000001081484184
d artagnan related his adventure with mme   12.214917510075493
monsieur de mazarin held us in prison monsieur du vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to england to quietly look on while they cut off the head of charles i   18.224423223787916
said he pardon me for having denied thee   22.10474586345081
casa pastrini   13.42580096759689
yes tis given   8.393907192936082
what are you doing   14.782905059459702
the lower one flew into pieces   10.58315109932353
well   15.474417908124773
and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost   9.222709706397207

the hostess who knew d artagnan s skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair   7.7064325545320616
d artagnan comprehended their irresolution   12.19370139965253
but now what did i do with that letter   16.926975422772774

i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap   10.28233794737125
at the hotel of said porthos   14.42359809510898
at the third he fell again   14.020617640192917
continued beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage   15.684189789838832
his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the window   13.18464474173421
emmanuel received him   3.525934701968106

my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused   12.29563386668036
the villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high   12.38969707127948
but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said monte cristo   14.383570926852894
certainly i do   11.35768913316329
cried mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands   12.525894630201433
but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me   10.11204909983544
yes we are going said aramis   6.6860806453916055
respect to fallen majesty   7.813798187421495
parry parted from his friends regretfully   11.35906833464427
endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of rome florence milan and madrid   8.307545779792276
i swear to you monsieur commissary that you are in the profoundest error that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done   14.93950616562697
i ask for no more   11.591557032381964
i can not be mistaken   14.528503120101
it is the nearest frontier   2.82101804462134
he took to his heels and was soon at m   19.65365974058169
yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember   5.813468349782119
at half past ten   15.416216213689083
this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son   13.829733122471886
i have bought enough fish of him to know his name   17.017586344475607
yes murmured flamarens lowering his eyes   14.47774247736932
but this was not what louis xiii   11.913676153095722
i can understand that said d artagnan   10.188702910012507
in the principality but not in the prince   8.961080063168733
oh no sir she answered   12.936544882600211
let us not talk about money if you please   9.707732566599406
but i have seen them drink it   14.048830037358849
the devil take this gout   6.122843981206488
meanwhile danglars stooping to monte cristo s ear your advice was excellent said he   9.082813490489654
a rich englishman continued the abbé who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value   11.89880733555454
it is humiliating   12.223927328232291
here said he leaning heavily on the arm of monte cristo here is the spot where my father stopped when the pharaon entered the port   10.1121202571423
i thought my body was my own and that i might sell it   12.827812138586593
a present from an enemy is not a good thing   11.68075000064905
but to grieve my father to disturb my grandmother s last moments never   14.530246899079863
the duke s endeavors evinced the best intention in the world but one of the precautions taken at vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to keep no money   17.789806055083183
and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten   2.723187346394969
suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you   16.866178875280823
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence   11.793994392526658
said planchet   2.3231632728034928
he could not be mistaken   12.33068909463332
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much   16.14006033318614
i my lord   14.317568107325236
have you that means   10.487805399297088
said d artagnan they will miss me   17.248274838397595
oh hear me to the end   19.313251943896645
here it is   6.349974781627699
cried mme   14.871744850901564
a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow   17.420078823898812
i will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family   13.71000849574181
as if all the world did not know who the countess g was   17.981526073255857
and i give you absolution beforehand   8.815739009819568
the regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct   7.9427234259329795
i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her   14.168270370771737
bring your comrades here one and all   21.283815648563674
ah maximilian i experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet i exclaimed forgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather   12.516812241928811
this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey   9.098550314479485
said d artagnan   13.206775106626848
allow me then to avoid dishonor by death   18.2010115095283
so much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seven in the morning bernouin came to arouse him his first words were well what s the matter   10.61702083792177
they were rapidly leaving the château d if behind   17.83812680226208
carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest   12.183613312539908
chapter li   11.309201307621052
chapter lxix   12.22429768232604
he is afraid and retreated before the bayonets madmen are not afraid of anything   13.026849093479946
what are you doing here   15.354643225288255
i am mad for her   9.760685197980958
alas i have them no longer   9.062974824701715
the shops were deserted houses closed   17.67902788869726
and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts   3.2174852139171115
beaten   11.851135883117703
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m   11.001614868987252
captain or mate m   11.017431502852311
for perhaps they were too high placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were   13.381197934476056
continued the old lady with a fearful expression that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty   12.036711935854003
bonacieux   23.18546006217378
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped   15.300616107128247
he asked the sergeant   8.004572047396007
what was the name of your old master   14.602389056252171
what will i do with him   13.090754869112738
at what hour shall we come   16.143887643279893
in proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor   20.340010763224967
and whilst he was lost in thought bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him   11.29538818977489
counteracted by parliament and insurrections   10.079495559091322
asked rochefort eagerly   14.8772217264551
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point   9.361884164617718
de villefort when shall i see you again   10.095012344006562
and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read   13.307329224985782
asked aramis haughtily   13.759592463578203
albert turned   12.978909155657943
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty   8.319493401466275
the count has an unlimited credit upon me   7.2829851546348925
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage   8.246086082605391
it yet stood under the shade of the fine avenue of lime trees which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles covered by an immense vine which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south   8.69991012287982
he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany   14.5950347590117
the journey monte cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together   11.520118645552722
but without taking any heed of the sword milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat   15.155303391188179
but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp   4.973556268461424
as long as they are in prison all will be well said anne but one of these days they will get out   18.411257807678034
and i have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at boulogne   7.253451816499339
threaten to speak and i will condemn you to infamy   3.255796164756582
come i am growing an old woman   10.706033421072464
when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate   7.309418086208961
planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by night   17.19491784774684
d artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat   12.978006712315649
and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris   11.014896681915737
in the morning milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended her   16.8167035087588
i think so truly   17.03271210275313
adieu countess   13.622779544106182
sire replied the cardinal sighing i believed myself secure from such a suspicion   12.888758951465649
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are mine   9.291365029328315
which   7.113676255796641
you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements   10.688350466006785
he is a maltese   6.877792383799422
monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening   9.71064893601197
arrived at the staircase it was still worse   11.499526762847463
these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder   14.17091330621295
for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed again and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself   9.194950965879496
you are a very complacent husband my dear monsieur bonacieux said the cardinal   13.873909753299415
parbleu   10.742100791060839
the siege of la rochelle the siege of la rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of louis xiii   12.206178372515904
cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off   8.116323899357667
debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain   12.908183985155045
have two riding horses ready   12.970739231975697
asked madame de villefort eluding her husband s question   14.271316981686715
he said you   15.68640338177071
cried d artagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he   8.730313442258378
well this surprises me for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs   15.381466068428363
the two young men shuddered for the same idea had more than once occurred to them   10.796843346316441
but i am a good sailor   19.272817962257655
the troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings   11.094814292530394
that s true said d artagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in that s true   10.88990175593872
why that i may be dangerously wounded killed even   13.53461284230745
so i think   8.353990009782045
for my part i always thought his poetry detestable and i think i know something about poetry   13.03766581469109
no one better   11.125848715523478
he would not   15.844172523919283
shouted d artagnan or you are dead   16.76409650253542
shall i knock   17.743895472591685
he started when he saw renée for he fancied she was again about to plead for dantès   7.298156260212471
he had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him   15.8078085252197
but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin   15.484530544621787
replied athos   18.542226074728553
when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you   14.962095476976902
willingly said aramis   8.532440415142144
a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone without a servant without lights   19.943735664929534
i found the tenant   9.721828985605086
he consequently sprang up again re entered the office with a turn of his finger set the clock right again that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street   18.21035686828449
no he is a man about my own size   2.113750607667761
replied mousqueton   11.016052813760583
1   16.356250905888164
they saw my mother in law their former regent expelled by the cardinal   16.437357060576737
we are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of heaven   14.562856605338066
of what nature   11.822591629547242
oh whatever may be m   15.028427688467024
many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the foot of st   15.085384401725358
ah you fear your prisoner should escape   11.131854746257455
and another servant entered   21.180624630839297
they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination   18.569448444104047
the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper   17.082401110621245
they were the heads of the two soldiers   11.580530043385831
asked franz   17.156579676985967
thank you   15.02400468065975
he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him   11.768051431914937
the steps were already down and the door open   11.471373929768761
debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive madame danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments   9.855668687922346
inquired the duke what does your majesty mean   12.575314472071787
listen hermine   10.310914757707515
let us wait   10.80363818561524
but then there must be some occasion for speaking   17.74018996041415
the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred   3.8068297289320636
i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is   8.283870955764748
with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of amiens   16.502337235611197
now to see things which i can not understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my life   19.461890014902657
my father is king s attorney replied andrea calmly   14.953123130842533
i once saved your life you know on what occasion   9.662375118600314
we were quite alone   14.700831809319533
at the cries of m   13.415626073342057
then as i believed my husband would be at home i hastened hither   15.919798365481704
go on   12.753733915592703
the count continued i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years   11.537693331175971
madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well done   9.767613672719726
said the young girl he never even glances at me   7.995458530485411
but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress   5.734048730635775
i think he is violently agitated   13.47034408594271
exclaimed d artagnan   5.998357370565868
there are circumstances in which one can not except through cowardice i offer you that refuge refuse to admit certain persons at least   17.135078722899
then you must die replied the president calmly   13.752798927646051
you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed   12.048636371757272
ah   5.4916747654977875
59   10.805609704337359
resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all directions   16.22048258979659
to how much   10.861561759492918
how do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions   8.627506003574151
he would have spoken but his voice failed him   5.795401887992871
the four friends looked at one another   12.272712600232142
undeceive yourself again   4.079809100015661
what are their names   16.76385936699326
emmanuel adieu   13.880646927300052
and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugénie yesterday   12.0396230895057
i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office   19.242442258827296
the cardinal put it on in military style   10.431642493712488
in short up to this period nothing had been wanting to tréville but opportunity   5.667837274024272
cromwell gazed a moment after him   10.924958473595629
comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage from which he made the people inside dismount and brought them to the vehicle which had upset   15.433393798562804
come raoul he said let us follow this man   9.217457821940503
could you have believed such a thing possible   13.74492855708858

coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat   11.058026576980103

we have seen plenty of dead men in our time   10.34505226552412
cried m   10.96577307203059
the blow was parried   19.9685104020358
the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea   12.311106765231035
you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me   12.944412060873958
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron   3.9884159826274566
cried she   16.231032395618715
yes yes said caderousse   13.593502506735987
said caderousse   8.024923896428492
at least said the abbé i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been   6.618537528287017
be easy   14.857423996662142
it is useless   13.677915065372193
here indeed are true believers   14.58524959373114
it was just two o clock by albert s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing room   15.289940793022245
where does your highness wish to go   6.571351637921811
he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still thank god good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner   16.079712375453827
reflect promise to be silent and riches consideration even honor shall surround you   11.134037758936245
a true friend s eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me   10.332975909032472
i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria a noirtier who had been a girondin during the revolution   13.12463574298671
they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider s pockets to make him weight   15.691972566987836
the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor   11.931158334305632
but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling   14.621628244109509
the inspector listened attentively   14.06031000411416
no i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of pascal and the house of wild turner of marseilles amounting to nearly 55 000 francs   9.62079527297152
do you then suspect anyone   15.764661593212054
she is a woman to return you the like and not to fail   12.165635224686996
de villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and caderousse   15.71359151408698
and a brave captain of spahis can not risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world   8.88307536173888
they ll kill poor porthos when he comes up said aramis   11.50672525706785
yes a base coward murmured d artagnan   16.179938373133993
it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot   7.858745300239279
yes   17.592850462970024
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction   13.376264256094744
do you hear nothing   14.511545906050152
but without valentine the earth is desolate   7.533019997110731
i hope so was the reply   19.43540684634185
i am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard   13.890475924999855
you must trust to me   12.854467616916804
franz and albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it   16.024292242845558
de tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might   12.438476509119344
to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them   15.69262786825571
you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about this   16.334008535560717
yes i offered you escape   12.327414727515972
madame faltered d artagnan tis twenty years ago i have a good memory since i had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville of kissing one of those lovely hands   14.50107038553718
he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living   14.307549518154168
she entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the count s attention   15.889305299439712
you seem incredulous said monte cristo who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french   10.606584901031772
for though i don t think his aid worth much one must with one s friends observe all due politeness said d artagnan   7.695881333848536
well i must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent fellow   16.81842996229405
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there   15.392329604654158
i am a victim of the cardinal   18.17188330480963
hate you sweet valentine exclaimed the young man   9.645822618571692
this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy s ears   17.087402969297024
left   9.633160315284387
what   12.076359029057326
only remember on the 5th of october morrel i shall expect you at the island of monte cristo   6.678994008637771
we have seen several ill looking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces   22.680657801913146
but whence have you obtained them   0.04542060196307318
mademoiselle danglars was still the same cold beautiful and satirical   8.43313274279015
as we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the abbé faria s pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading le drapeau blanc   15.46777557749007
certainly for he told me   10.547960578975147
and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month   18.53456659532186
well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu   11.340366897811396
there was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither mme   8.722472087326212
in royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all   13.817994826138762
and now my dear girl said d artagnan you know that it is not good for any of us to be here   21.52596725797132
you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris   8.993312794270269
farewell my son said the curate till tomorrow   16.576925423000127
cried milady   11.527618712282456
do not seek your wife read d artagnan   16.428779203602044
in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that   12.824151406750387
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and château renaud   8.91975205197284
are you not rich yourself   13.331296164217328
at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniards twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet   8.585346154284665
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state   8.25630085601894
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends   19.126222979790672
i have already told you that we do not sell at retail   6.046581303619221
said the young man   9.522476395409383
tis true   8.284288795134836
is it my father   12.737270519144134
he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee   13.151150165965204
said the light horseman   11.975861427094042
s   10.306816659575631
and who was that   13.588740506672877
what   11.022584258704796
there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse   8.78025160335345
what then   11.384013925914271
we met in the place royale egad   17.37060929182664
asked his wife pale as death   9.7558567391469
but i can not accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already prepared   12.183294445613885
i endured the rain during the day and the cold during the night tolerably well but the third morning my horse died of cold   3.321964027029887
your servants to whom i gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the inn   9.64133956899251
if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape   13.605627658535962
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty it s true but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in him he is conceited and stupid   18.57592913164534
the profession of arms suits you   11.845682522422292
she is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it   12.311969543229296
but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged luigi to be his guide   18.823267253081383
i suppose so said andrea with a triumphant smile since i am accepted   20.43924728316958
what you talk of debaucheries madame messalina lady macbeth   14.968465946388346
said julie   21.373468818356447
the enemy was marching upon lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from france the army of france   4.363638254934112
the count came towards him   10.374644442368998
and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert   12.26944894997742
what do you propose   15.839585871178407
he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma the one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery   7.905759961742681
say no more about it   6.693491859122366
he could not help thinking of m   12.930420953138063
tis off one of my sheep   17.7102545615948
but d artagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams   9.017620528134119
on   8.634265495498102
listen   16.363909151490972
the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing   10.361315696054337
how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them   22.264669467286463
come he was the first of us to go   17.916942612890423
captivity the first day let us return to milady whom a glance thrown upon the coast of france has made us lose sight of for an instant   21.142940173120653
what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion   7.841590644905193
you did well to defend the honor of a woman   12.718423585294765
it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it   9.36289846915065
decidedly my dear athos said d artagnan i should like better not to risk anything   12.076899943752132
planchet   14.920383333335268
said aramis   7.648209348834145
then you persist in continuing that thesis   16.468306163910363
if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done   19.928316138674013
a thousand things   6.9955483342221845
i could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer myself   5.070150495248906
heir   12.529942472494913
and who served under an assumed name   15.38178413698516
the cause of misfortune of religion royalty   9.47527255293327
you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind   19.041620326064226
but he is perfectly unknown to me   18.86993467298352
at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin s wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and caderousse uttered a cry of pain   3.556180791476251
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publisher s office   12.354639498636288
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on end   9.655705021922145
so much the worse   11.352060861606171
and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me   8.548257810902797
the weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air   17.11808187351121
no   11.63922562760297
who is your second witness   14.575612313737151
i have fought too long   14.854617415657003
said valentine   13.446271781273582
now really let me ask sir have you   12.176082992323654
mordaunt and touches me keenly   11.787456675559746
i dare not write to his majesty   13.640869713007827
i will be silent then said milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner   18.604879776486058
thanks to the sale of his horse he commenced his career with four more crowns than m   14.468367954383933
a shot was fired that moment   6.932198734251565
hem   7.551564048123357
if i sought your ruin fool i should drag you to the first guard house   21.322641287686867
the particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance   10.04972972698589
ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three french attendants commanded by myrtho   8.874880618095583
decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure   9.813380249281337
i believe she is detained in france by some love affair   8.77871450778661
renée regarded him with fond affection   15.929591207367437
are these persons then so rich and powerful   10.204492442009263
then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo   8.301510213958428
i will proclaim you a piece of immaculate virtue   11.443075241633855
with pleasure replied d artagnan   11.941017329670665
aramis   13.623416268182755
the house you purchase is at auteuil   15.933879768721141
it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit   9.92612390629782
here they are monseigneur   12.341149676745669
her   16.62997740318425
i am not very clever at pretexts   15.213293215578855
gone never to return   14.54588877157294
and your majesty has a good memory   13.706221192273153
at length they arrived at the famous room   17.938119947362885
but now answer me   9.38934031669035
but by this evening there will be four   13.477446034789377
how do you mean   15.755746428126322
who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine   8.44804475664521
she speculated and lost   16.125802047638064
thanks monsieur   1.3235232283505827
well i sold my shares the news got out and i no longer sold i gave them away next day i find the news was false and by this false report i have lost 700 000 francs   18.089394691139052
julie hesitated   13.063938265025397
asked aramis   17.133653634692717
let me live   13.817169494053644
you told me to give them to him   15.35697342073801
having aroused the enmity of the sultan he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822 at the age of eighty   6.9136652454729655
said the young man   12.05647520311277
involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of noirtier s room where he had seen him the preceding night   9.834338591058664
all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself   10.683229563170503
courage take courage my dear mother   7.43209760026099
what circumlocution   16.19081886755892
was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery   7.39406530335574
thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands   6.261966112711247
for i am sure the count is his father   7.986416684145144
but suggested d artagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so well at chantilly porthos   8.880872063095751
what could she have done to you   17.880427005715433
a tumultuous movement shook the partition   13.201924929300574
the executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat again   6.901718396020542
but such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal   18.047045815279336
the hand of the lord is stretched over him said felton   10.86604324020305
it is my brother setting off again   8.803689055889746
yes   7.83186589523029
creatures of the people armed with halberds guarding your doors   13.683276431742994
said athos rising   8.889702664920772
what is going on my lord   12.5002181881001
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully   16.12365450533989
why so   15.42176413467638
you   13.121514130750692
but i can not said she   10.298526705051408
he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night   7.726111122343352
de monte cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which i have never forgotten   11.03755652096179
and besides the crime appearing useless it would be folly to commit it   13.316352671269286
tréville said to himself if the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failed he who knows how bitterly i execrate him to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him   13.20874898375089
who i   14.045513149871086
to embark with you   15.224985091667953
do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing   7.923752320424244
begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight   9.885864591590495
tis nothing nothing   8.348851562196469
yes you understand that explains all   12.6030537112706
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor   12.22756050858407
is that his christian name   13.074451802504448
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key   5.034351885229561
it is very natural   14.393534805729676
opened the door entered and shut it after them   11.068841282655132
you did well   17.436434009735407
no false generosity count   9.533954302075175
or in the neighborhood   4.867269731112415
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear   16.086418914441687
yes   9.636869377955692
relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wife s story to see if the two recitals tallied   14.850148074879826
our master will scold us for it   15.630810870795024
d artagnan took a pen and wrote madame until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor   11.714611732004682
i have been more than a year absent from paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut   14.180520961950167
one only   8.174845705419443
he asked of groslow   10.439281934386353
exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds   2.968368863757661
d artagnan said the minister sitting down i am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer   15.474970647776654
cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive   15.622281940609195
d artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme   16.35622712467937
and this king s attorney was named villefort   7.304431490606739
i entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if i may venture to tell you so i also feel anxious   8.060829043195135
certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said   13.965245750369384
d artagnan i have always loved you as my son   7.504478845067011
and now leave me monsieur bertuccio to walk alone here in the garden   9.543040715276746
said she simpering   12.030855751247875
therefore in spite of olivain s remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him   12.009104880073972
in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law   11.792846214588872
and what will you do in that case   9.988825325253641
with my usual fatuity i doubted it   13.849125566979396
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep   1.580766842414917
really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with man that is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace   10.853440950497504
he spoke the romaic language did he   11.530674494556516
why did he not bring it to me here   19.669666432011162
you can not be speaking seriously athos   7.724830683216038
dressed with the greatest elegance and who wore the order of the holy ghost   6.248480721824435
at this moment a horse neighed   8.11956364348114
but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman s word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be so   11.579152778167483
was that all he said   14.797284999332065
my mother cried mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint i can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen   13.222608386368568
it was the letter of aramis monsieur d artagnan you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale   10.345480538047374
to which of us   18.948935383087143
afterward   19.799128857324252
what   17.757745313613068
all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter   19.61438700907219
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below   2.3164983997524153
always   2.0930257279784588
d artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many rochellais   13.111704514835976
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didn t mean mischief   13.194047491252421
overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight   12.466690764585426
he took no refreshment   7.004567897411806
then a body which after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea turned gently on its back according to the caprice of the waves and floated   10.24337084686988
the queen had at first positively refused   8.291501183905641
why i think said aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token d artagnan may sell it   14.17256429096578
the minister s wife pardieu   13.254930153751092
besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon   8.128889764290342
here i am sir   17.999479792888334
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry   16.569560107476416
the third in the gardens of amiens   9.413895566051403
but he soon sighed for he passed before la réserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball   16.47389186386569
he does not wish you to know that it comes from him   11.91393274453499
he had no other   18.083617599729813
i have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds mine   15.079667366785282
i leave you therefore as i took you rich but little respected   9.938293492814097
as he was passing the allée des veuves he thought he saw the count s horses standing at gosset s shooting gallery   7.948311921659481
why they are our men   3.2852341975525228
exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination   18.03622357776732
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned   15.247409007532571
yes   15.031511372880408
said athos   12.611905570609428
the king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing   8.476681301722284
the gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went downstairs   11.017247010731545
you have an account open with messrs   12.285249522739813
well said he do you still doubt   20.761037393166326
i am saved   20.136531678549204
except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction   14.894521147498939
duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes   8.46460116672266
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that   10.149023993881347
they pitied the young king who was unconsciously ruining his country and threw all the odium of his proceedings on mazarin   13.425533749461968
if you would but accept my offers   17.76377951272026
noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition   19.358559359160473
you dislike him i think   8.544122176243945
let us proceed therefore to the usurper s conversion   11.170283739035463
ah   12.486866655717979
to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of d artagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d artagnan   7.729391625024826
ah   8.389611795440818
his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin   7.57393910971785
when d artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve o clock was striking   3.261046055870999
cardinal mazarin as king   7.685364597597093
valentine valentine   8.615467603345738
he is awaiting your majesty at cours la reine   16.713615641775522
d artagnan put the purse into his pocket   7.863617221239947
but i have still something left   10.050123164787603
he alone would have any influence with them   9.845994110321941
something must have happened   13.804864184181655
pardon me   10.2446226999207
i remember him monsieur   12.466819757745313
you hear madame   9.887618475388189
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights   10.273763867041119
and all the sovereigns of the earth even cæsar borgia himself could not deprive me of this   19.99035024095872
kill myself   15.274240485304716
his name tell it me   5.808130971716267
the young girl did not speak   14.862803908543533
observe the smallest gesture the least bit of song the least sign from any one near you   9.838139364108056
asked raoul astonished   9.6347843228884
as fast as they entered they were placed in the grand saloon on the platforms prepared for them   10.575000560350068
in which the plot thickens his visit to m   13.132030760310023
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you   13.44977407679545
the musketeers rode the whole length of the faubourg saint antoine and of the road to vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a village   10.363615904068944
a friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their aid   12.64049251590665
sir said d avrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late   17.887489485594067
had his and these two powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring not only from all the provinces of france but even from all foreign states the most celebrated swordsmen   10.74990297828983
fore gad these frenchmen have no consideration   11.538275769639469
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name   15.186418561059227
friends   12.851550319297397
and we place ourselves at your orders   10.582776691696031
let it come said athos   10.505579915440562
noirtier seeing barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man   13.938647148522273
andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune   10.368980542690641
he is a particular friend of mine   9.331149546510705
but why should i have done otherwise   10.386566291481495
oh   12.338489828529653
and have you replied to everyone as you have to me   19.609749527720005
but have you no groom   5.5066565117595
he tore the dress of the countess to pieces   12.78776269671716
but as la jeune amélie had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to leghorn   14.324138287533412
if innocent to be set at liberty   22.054859382819643
farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full gallop   8.791805057326034
i do not hesitate you know said grimaud   13.82557914706744
upon my honor this man fancies the world belongs to him   4.730637218593561
live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is summed up in these two words wait and hope   10.354038565882668
and what do you think i did   12.040347643992508
the journey has given me a devil of an appetite   12.75462263951661
my dear aramis you speak like theology personified   9.31597840032158
they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation   12.723555475612093
one fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishing boat boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the never to be forgotten night of his departure for the château d if he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither   17.89262191019453
the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place   7.943509826212959
i had replied the count   14.523481972276734
what is it then   14.814946551037618
the cold sweat sprang to the young man s brow and his teeth chattered   10.840614850585464
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned round   15.781534585110599
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried   10.503501322055577
and you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble   14.161995451402506
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you   11.923181844530607
in my last moments i need a friend   7.181626833808334
oh no never mind that said the italian   17.638695126256785
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him   6.741642187110551
then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton   13.526756436155905
when i ask you if you are consoled i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets   12.105838909082347
the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement   8.848957526160417
d artagnan wrote the child s name in his tablets   14.029486037196248
do so madame do so and that at once   8.159835677687255
yet i think i hear her piano   14.96089407031186
yes you   12.43528223098433
the same evening the following was read in le messager by telegraph   1.7984246480816992
because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this morning   10.291490131971711
villefort from his study heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a house the opening and shutting of doors the ringing of madame de villefort s bell to summon the waiting maid mingled with the first shouts of the child who rose full of the enjoyment of his age   13.476635357357855
but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be   14.094709925654486
de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans   10.275082379504612
d artagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake   4.644304115935748
and what is it to you   11.018491859995997
this army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcher it matters little colonel harrison   15.08813711971701
yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule   6.78517317572428
ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o clock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated   17.455489397107073
it would be rendering a service to her future son in law   10.666282801584321
at these words which left no hope milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak   12.953065129542834
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinal s hat for him   13.05726581489925
but should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north   0.346563326605283
no but i know a little about wounds and mine i know is mortal   20.189948648700835
but pshaw   12.007586974156267
i suspect no one   14.6110085009512
yes it was i   17.36308811967138
awaken me   13.907839467404983
and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon you   19.768764281545657
monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting   17.242346471818145
a carriage was in readiness at the door   12.194771485459862
athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head   21.192145307290943
we had better wait and see what they want   14.21273609136437
what you do not know   13.091227029616595
do you refuse   8.579892456594251
but you must in the first place reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wife s relations with madame de chevreuse   19.434686523507736
after passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raoul s way of riding and observed take care raoul   16.22324249882335
what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream   17.67246295400657
i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars   12.61559609426348
let me have some dinner   13.911848814227941
it drives me to despair said fernand   8.71884168437735
they still hesitated an instant   8.960140735855138
said one   14.988379751387038
i am endeavoring he thought to make this man happy   2.448528769642987
monte cristo turned around   14.790805422578481
younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names   5.815880663205681
since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red   11.621501719990368
you thoroughly understand me sir   5.467365083011586
i wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself myself and a third person   7.8460566568082095
and taking up grimaud and blaisois they went on foot to the rue guenegaud   11.428150834514753
ah madame cried debray what is the matter with you   9.419676701236238
that is best said the king   8.876729777063272
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour   15.96378482600872
well while i was watching not the king as monsieur le comte thinks for i know what it is to see a man led to death and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill while i was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as i said to find out who he was   13.237990392241834
then my dear sir   13.031269780708127
we even joked very pleasantly if i remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest   7.657183687514322
by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies   12.879755804129374
unfortunately i didn t crush him flat   14.8217151635277
i answer for all that the prince said   10.638337694264349
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through fear   16.507194402988656
d   8.916646113324422
you really wish to see her   9.472187966117094
this time he could not blame dantès   14.87682176627425
and the best hack   13.001542175327003
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary   12.441372307450617
the morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze   17.648497227442014
asked hermine trembling violently   2.457129428214495
here monsieur mazarin is everything   7.4974811497523035
ah   11.955736368548944
i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m   6.405816874114945
impossible   14.526894269083886
she has neither son money nor friends   17.631218037304926
so from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable   14.474314902388617
creating the works from print editions not protected by u   11.39178836945907
the cardinal rang a second time   11.377275747688708
by whom   25.11508916967541
faithful to his mission of vengeance athos had requested to be conducted to the garden   16.7096317278231
say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army   12.981560539154367
but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks   8.452472790874895
the past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others   12.276843560662028
what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty   8.998532490620383
are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves   11.978068161801444
they are beating the rappel   6.372097261977495
the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors   12.505305075710659
well then speak   9.715056613414859
30293m then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbé busoni   17.416907912539223
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter   15.601208918910917

but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the world   12.626573304670403
for a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him   12.194272416031096

you know it is not my fault said morrel   11.972627133215163

the heroine of the bouquet kept her word   6.229155392852916
we have said that teresa was handsome but this is not all   14.246904067342195

raoul gave it up reluctantly   12.159584852572687

i know nothing about it my lord   15.302876722040493

while mercédès as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to albert s while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard   11.983776169078991
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed   21.466314658838257
the joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it   19.548073711844822
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood   8.300294876587504
and now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king   18.518300856610004
the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god   8.191876654716829

the dying man s eyes were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped succor would arrive   14.059588883219414

milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition   12.736192144861883
bless me i quite forgot the races   12.480753365520334
but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom   24.790665285055773
we can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least   3.9368136739951805
two hours have i been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if i am going   19.219409602981205
for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre   5.265480718212768
cried d artagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress   15.22910423713628
d artagnan who had secured the key shut himself up in the closet without reply   19.765143932129718
his excellency did not charge me to purchase this house   13.72277552061428

and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships   7.753282542873066
isn t there still time to repair the evil   11.613468669956532

i will not irritate him thought edmond and taking the paper of which half was wanting having been burnt no doubt by some accident he read this treasure which may amount to two   7.4695273806495965
porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well   22.876999975255274
edmond dantès   4.73566677738907

de tréville waited for the king   13.966265162480067
in an instant all five were ready   8.553939488277637
well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips   4.956051860811808
everything goes as if in flowery paths   14.745945452180164

you will tell me that i am a living being and not a code a man and not a volume   17.589159344555608

really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse   6.3538943196659705
whilst porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard   11.598063048281226
sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed   10.453790771541676
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag   11.33972555369486
who can possibly have told you i had had that dream   7.548823661572284

in ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be there   10.486461604226358
then she cried ahem   13.663509453226165
and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the door and left the room   13.650720435103144
i ought to have known you better by this time   12.787543178922022

the two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to marshal de grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given   4.675060265210846
never mind where it comes from said porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink it   11.017110678747121
do not hurry yourself monsieur lest it be observed that we go out together   14.038200458572401
he thought to himself how can i take care of both   18.4415208696728
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o clock   10.88943691013481
but on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe   9.916308209678991
fernand too is invited   17.997745569751196
i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minute s delay   14.726028850238912
the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor   18.85308436341851
really   14.263085197768538
wonderfully said d artagnan   8.358363723256511
bonacieux was going   15.08069959112483
murmured mme   10.106071740181182
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door   15.001375278539173
but at the very moment when d artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it m   10.62176064527479
andrea cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that question   13.232911933067083
the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable   13.843715871775986
run waiter   11.579762553173083
already dantès had visited this maritime bourse two or three times and seeing all these hardy free traders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds   7.143628246893224
athos followed comminges without saying a single word   10.34692084720634
he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague   10.261939372640246
the hands among women particularly to be beautiful must be idle   14.8112242670954
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there   16.20946614300757
but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders i mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions   12.42759766783912
at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me   9.512540422487058
the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs élysées and made monte cristo raise his head   12.027024509543562
the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal shaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin   1.717568592010542
asked mousqueton rather uneasy   9.985259874388838
he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it   14.807382362372456
danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day   13.860781494078655
my father has revealed the culprit s name   7.462567266752067
yes and i will tell you   14.165329629211623
he was the first to jump on shore   18.444358524440037
when it was seen that danglars sold the spanish funds fell directly   10.536534279305297
i have already told you answered the abbé that i loathe the idea of shedding blood   9.57182547527174
leave all to me   18.113855714981245
and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour   10.874049429705266
inquired grimaud   12.253741501418407
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward   13.33506363278829
badly kept i own but still you must not calumniate it for that   9.441290774196027
then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you   4.613228355130631
are you mad to talk to me thus   6.494732114600977
the war will not only be approved of but directed by the church   12.793889406267597
here it would be dangerous   10.911161034742204
hush   18.37250401613191
the chocolate was inoffensive for m   4.865158662801474
i have my carriage here said the president   13.577533976360348
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title   11.8774082560756
how would you set about it   17.477187439357937
1 through 1   12.491150121257425
it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of athos murmuring he is avenged   14.285769311919987
but once free and placed in communication with laporte matters resumed their course and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which but for her arrest would have been executed three days earlier   9.760001043385854
she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good bye to you in full dress   12.826237802129011
i know it from my wife monsieur from my wife herself   11.655914263170654
inquired danglars   11.924784541201289
the old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his wish   7.713216308916801
you know the rest   7.587914809122364
what men call the chances of fate namely ruin change circumstances i have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me   13.412181170905757
well then go wait for me there and i will soon join you   9.636438003852378
if they catch thee thou wilt be hung   10.567429020895515
yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly   8.782859477814137
there they are   16.108241843846884
and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week   16.373421200166824
bazin who had been standing listening to all this controversy with a pious jubilation sprang toward them took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the jesuit and walked respectfully before them to clear their way   12.050017917423652
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor   8.298442956203068
because she had been branded continued d artagnan   22.388260929112107
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards valentine and for the first time noticed the white lips   11.793942533803339
this time it was mordaunt who smiled   8.189338783151582
the moment of your deliverance is at hand   13.16776949804252
at neufchâtel go to the tavern of the golden harrow give the password to the landlord and you will find as you have here a horse ready saddled   10.971980168740979
i am unlucky   13.605486930763835
excellently well said   13.010682958910179
then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl s heart   9.114620430943292
for all evils there are two remedies time and silence   11.35743286332233
so far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your love   13.478173075793135
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it   14.487895105759085
said he approaching the cardinal eagerly   15.984717504885017
what is the king doing   6.1788939370280795
his visit of the day before it is to be remembered had been very short and very little explicative   4.996435863552508
i have already got up again after three stabs from you i shall never rise after this fourth   15.1889902434249
he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse   10.610473922840315
that a stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and murdered ali   14.248412494759116
the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father s death   17.966883574387506
i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings   18.90909744868776
tis easily guessed   8.830091073445228
aramis and d artagnan whispered to each other   11.26160047626655
a second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a flag   11.158223063026915
but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead   12.383205238004406
oh good lord cried porthos what precautions for the study of theology   14.779993726695697
i sometimes wonder replied athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together   16.469715758760024
muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection   15.865462536942903
he laid every action of his life before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us   13.910829446548627
exclaimed the young man   7.953246181584165
noirtier sent for me i am ready to attend to his wish   5.080286315059128
but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them   11.959605520998116
danglars no longer had a daughter   8.036522577620342
five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage   12.713383966877037
we have a fixed price for all our provisions   6.766250119923548
you have had too much already drunkard said danglars   15.488915278340528
i know no better means than to act with candor   11.016873547344046
he is awake so keep on the watch as they are gone away   10.9803458658036
but d artagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it   2.543226981579549
the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abbé busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nîmes   10.720027939753313
but added the queen in awaiting the cardinal s decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only   16.940553410882888
let me see it said milady   15.659310741000454
at the usual time morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtier s room   15.40766730671498
it was impossible   7.888791728680515
i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me   11.95379288886688
but if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you   13.2566604585247
it was now nine o clock   10.643556109701823
what took place at portsmouth august 23 1628 chapter lx   7.653159279797699
replied debray   11.813500906904528
noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to m   6.063489967668914
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people   12.12545329660896
pardieu if that is all i am hungry too   9.457855743061417
my lord to a well bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track   8.967687207266122
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence   11.314089375812975
why the idea of taking quarters with senor perez seems to me very reasonable and for my part i agree to it   8.6051113416498
prorsus admirabile   11.312830830007172
there was silence   14.50035122114056
well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that i am his neighbor   15.079634926747538
aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags   13.119833323316282
two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mention the viscount de bragelonne   13.014652469401817
he has this moment returned   8.483412179900355
an expedition sir   16.122565587674938
said athos   13.194164225125679
and to have ideas added madame danglars   11.140128146141743
how ghastly pale he is   16.087531067744877
cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of eugénie has never been admitted   16.73401294519511
but don t touch me   17.85026809804348
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure   12.729618759880474
it was the same through which twenty four years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard   9.418714991296206
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old man s happiness was centred in his granddaughter   19.767306377266486
d artagnan slipped into the wardrobe   10.170622572309153
you know they are my witnesses   18.04952992047677
0243m i awoke as the clock was striking six   14.71848500895412
well well said m   12.11374271810425
what consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you   11.108467355251594
what company   7.194934089536876
one day as i was conveying my wife back to the louvre he was coming out as she was going in and she showed him to me   16.53614685510269
hate reproach the man that has spared my son s life   9.233616545799588
but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends   13.091717480092514
this famous invention of yours   7.628169753689333
this person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with flowers   12.091626864239013
but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called mouston was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was   12.157615531749757
that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are   11.82276169493196
porthos made a sign of assent   16.144522706191815
then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk   17.26305203664086
and if i am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for i have no future to look forward to   6.729666735279967
yes i will take a biscuit as you are so obliging   13.040679849628082
he would never think of faring in the same manner as his master   7.111304339746733
but you receive him at your house   15.073103301741902
you must be satan   8.294656830072325
he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor   10.03370722614202
alas   12.714414418335343
the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment   8.761639538798232
athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger   18.60320504858034
d artagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village   14.114547976807788
two poniards a knotted rope and a poire d angoisse   13.418185541527151
only replied tréville it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue can not exempt a man from infamy and persecution   7.925420486693581
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box   11.736718335369066
well your eternal city is a nice sort of place   11.550502239445567
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her   5.81310319884327
everything said he to raoul shall be done as you desire   12.722382193779286
do what i tell you and immortality awaits you   14.496996009208571
he is quite a child   6.8872842414888975
and i said aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that i will roast you at a slow fire like a savage   9.380402888270183
at ten o clock   0.9280538647069729
cried athos   10.389849278606821
isn t this fox a genius athos   5.221781696027824
villefort shuddered at the suggestion   4.419714623674401
you frighten me not executioner s axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and i strike you now waiting patiently and christianly for you to return the blow   11.969455700967625
come porthos join me   9.04170491118468
yes you   16.356077582243373
so that he is quite elated about it   12.691625681363101

the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade   7.330191546593942
what is that   5.249532475829036
ah he s gone to blois   12.694733471524039
he was eighteen only three years older than you are raoul when i saw him set to work pitted against tried men   9.495782512195257
this time there was no longer any doubt   10.701904684977006
he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes   5.831951216414865
then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle mars s diamonds   8.839706612246223
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people   8.836052481621449
shall we not set forth   14.716699320452216
he was then as punctual as the samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say   18.77291626237049
be it so   10.548773596723501
discontented sir   11.213767689625968
he is a hero sir   6.327043275145392
and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations   15.44707434117806
my lord   12.515217983915816
directly   10.74989563439282
monsieur franz is his friend you know   14.48668613700993
people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven   16.30443869313445
sir said the prudent planchet in the first place are you on good terms with monsieur de rochefort   8.369862177237053
asked morrel   8.363673676704797
i always suppose anything people please and besides you must concede something to diseased minds   12.934199050283905
you are wounded said he   10.234940606936082
well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left i succeeded i did in making them all begin with the same foot and i was made lieutenant on the spot   12.003895363262473
life itself may be resolved into three words erat est fuit   12.925147784190555
cried d artagnan   18.241288423226116
he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling   10.646032492042314
de villefort   9.805600862515949
well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people   13.883514256591988
his family will care much about such a trifle as that   7.349937639028051
i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence   23.800884153811214
let us try and overtake this gentleman said raoul to olivain   9.532064718348195
will you invite young m   8.864173937414492
and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him   20.86468288546736
d artagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black hood   7.5640755952982275
was he liberated then   14.495612713806558
at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo   16.448210740105136
morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank   20.95932498209674
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room   20.082946598602884
and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at bazin   19.346839972121593
there they are   11.378277493230781
yes morrel said monte cristo with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young man s excitement   16.926660194222382
i have eight men on guard you know   12.741321630122972
it was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey   10.540059756812584
i will join you again at marseilles   21.798543315819632
s   9.610120062199504
see what i have written during these two days and nights   6.678991245942974
shall we watch by the corpse   10.390625168378165
i have an idea which i will explain by and by of making an exception to the usual form of accusation   13.382176393708537
thanks for your devotedness gentlemen   15.866792491245043
we two are worth a dozen   16.01762326286487
porthos   8.779982143997733
one in rue de vaugirard the other rue de la harpe   9.061518465567772
then he will tell it me himself   10.900292914613598
d artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure   26.327348939852445
at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday   11.353030767054376
you will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box   10.874789630830106
wait patiently then   16.16037789425513
i in m   15.628995356829185
from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal   13.217206201184949
and why should i regret what gives you pleasure   13.781207404533932
when he had mounted his phaeton monte cristo turned and seeing bertuccio what news   16.959073374784445
i kiss your hands   16.283117930009865
d artagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred   19.33143736589901
and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces   7.446630661906406
to the bar publicly cried   18.783715398926287
no material obstacle separated them   1.6176718260744494
come sir he said lend me twenty francs   7.19286846642111
and he tapped gently at the door   19.446111826253752
could de rochefort have forestalled him with athos   5.494999511422776
the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris followed by mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm   19.76474755181796
athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles   21.3542839647763
you see your friends are wakeful   6.420689283865033
who am i   17.15941991729901
now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation with captain leclere   12.1787957268327
nothing else   9.750957021637207
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him   16.195320308257262
why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed   9.705691244727955
i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole   20.685397453855153
the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench   12.758711168902604
he will see us if we go out   6.328307861533465
said the queen   5.986419114537709
i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta   5.618020452031066
she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling   14.492680598982755
d artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses   18.815092437442157
give three to your wife and you will still have four   11.50920076002999
yes monsieur   11.62508584037535
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder   12.733981928224198
but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives himself   10.583941809728847
at these words he rose and put off his frock coat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his son s toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers   19.050124514687077
said the baroness   18.952455205663284
no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it   9.912741611152178
about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner   17.33868542762378
but when the cardinal added that not only mme   8.811973554681508
but until that time i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across   10.236404271961243
said the grave diggers two   5.988807144051262
on the contrary he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his hand   11.101441017135674
pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but i had wholly forgotten you   7.561303399004584
there was a crowd on the pier   15.063637308739873
no he muttered the doubt i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness   11.97282666623075
happy father happy son   16.341708768073264
what must be done   12.678728072022729
i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom murmured athos   11.49573721873785
taste the hashish guest of mine taste the hashish   12.549239394497004
are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades   15.646004106756692
dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek   6.535109735849639
it was the telegraph room   10.10816905340459
oh madame i do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times i am your most respectful servant   16.959788893735002
and he fell back on the bed pale trembling and apparently about to die   18.007909315514887
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m   10.386144903996371
listen madame and recall your remembrances   9.506299738691837
have you any other guests in your house   4.08746845184675
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based   1.868988977275615
franz took out his watch it was half past four   16.0305761140801
my dear dantès said he swear to perform what i am going to tell you for it is a matter of the deepest importance   12.762836905424352
but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation   16.517737959560513
yesterday for two hours i was at the church of saint philippe du roule and for two hours i prayed most fervently   7.049634700580617
i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air   7.739675696190382
3 and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready   14.728650559290491
i must have time to file through these bars   7.689322573694933
what is that   9.445395125260736
i did   8.04879906133901
two of my good friends lord wilmore and the abbé busoni   16.797772319760504
parisians and frondeurs as they were the two friends expected to find the same misery the same fears the same intrigue in the enemy s camp   9.451493298609579
for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat   11.165713904687461
i understand   17.77121872170837
but why do you pity instead of blaming me   10.035049377970084
i will do mine elsewhere   24.65302171491528
it is urgent that i should have this money without delay   14.661578662387486
a dinner in the old style   9.550901240498632
it is you your honor he said advancing toward d artagnan   17.72359494408101
the following sunday then the parisians arose with joy   17.1179592731164
d artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of mme   13.770746779962666
the promise volume four chapter 74   15.248199136156506
germain   11.860465928075028
and how long had you to take care of him   10.321633464336086
delaunay   12.795436712680388
he clapped his hands three times the ordinary signal of lovers   14.539432882079186
de la trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal s guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the king s musketeers   11.254815145128212
well perhaps   10.895874743526294
count replied maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures   18.90619430202927
said athos while d artagnan went to conduct kitty downstairs   19.347877200855784
felton made no resistance   17.02471883881416
0325m i did   8.029898461312303
and you know the axiom non bis in idem   24.348296970126228
the same story muttered the jeweller   19.95348843022351
would you rather die then and cause maximilian s death   15.278503244475369
i think he has only been introduced to madame de villefort   12.32381508390738
a new governor arrived   10.98027355531671
i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said d artagnan   12.780423549810985
wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket   12.949714996573961
he inquired   10.02712720757487
and i advise you not to take 25 000 francs for the profits of the voyage   6.820835468619827
so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred   15.515746140880996
the warm pressure made d artagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked himself   7.214068197958052
murmured danglars   7.828642440792341
why he is a second ariosto   19.471920748027927
as to porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair   11.830998996509745
well   10.67602857120793
yes it s all my fault because it is myself who selects my men   13.688274680082191
said noirtier   10.427564397415466
a family affair athos had invented the phrase family affair   12.010684524147434
well   16.95242070882315
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion   10.845542707858163
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation   10.086102531339847
the king has no authority here   12.681769255030321
he heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door   0.9323848534804018
he is an abbé   21.449280330618784
open the gate he cried   8.313212209059493
meanwhile what are you going to do   14.650134020413882
danglars smiled at the good natured pleasantry of the count   12.909172703865277
which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious one   14.707253760115327
an h and an n surmounted by a baron s coronet   18.756553148838915
i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other   6.799390588102692
and that is but just said athos and he took aside the one of the four englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low voice   14.49765225284246
dantès noticed that the captain of la jeune amélie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so   14.96879430852613
the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars said château renaud   5.935931739523543
said albert entering   12.239032818259535
oh spare me   17.511059725103827
yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits   8.333073730095883
on two of my shirts   3.868565191698254
edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart   15.8968730755642
porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed planchet   12.80929539099822
he now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer   10.492524455050276
de morcerf   9.924844006334606
monsieur said emmanuel have the goodness to address yourself to m   14.448313003756704
asked the general   12.87431716087056
oh   12.79748027065632
he is walking about and thinking thought d artagnan   16.527292708125046
let me know what crime i have committed   15.76829698130215
and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen i promise not to reward you i believe that word would offend you but to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one   11.826962870308781
i will run to monsieur de tréville to tell them all this and will meet them there   12.607142486321305
albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole but he kept the faded one in his hand   8.574374914118781
he met villefort on his way to noirtier s room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept   11.417765695330576
his dishonor reflects upon us   13.469277949946008
baron have you any report more recent than this dated the 20th february and this is the 3rd of march   12.204986202745287
it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so   13.93441436382182
means for classical tragedy chapter lviii   9.01526035151506
porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post   13.757991843408895
do you wish to assassinate a man who in the eyes of heaven is a brother   9.316223332989626
porthos rose saluted his friends and followed mousqueton   6.061032626236952
i consent on condition that la ramee tries them with me   14.745522216401298
porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow   10.325805354561586
we have learnt nothing forgotten nothing   10.214917258875687
d artagnan only sighed   10.780895633261517
de monte cristo   5.099013498712831
what is it   22.256757121899874
at last as i seemed to cling to life i was ordered to the south   16.601075726398967
then remarked madame de villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous aqua tofana that they said was lost at perugia   5.516350382400867
these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken   13.325392732525739
villefort was no longer the civilized man   6.385997497896416
impossible   9.59374585064475
i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said   10.517790697843962
i have no horse said d artagnan   14.078155611240042
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked   16.654122002903293
at what hour   15.005460082821894
whatever may ensue i will go   9.22099087547061
athos waved his hand raoul bowed and d artagnan and planchet set out   15.803655902517804
truly she might have thought of you at home   13.094339732055802
the carriage stopped   8.075098926340772
he has just left me replied de winter after telling me all   10.770196049204547
yes your excellency said the captain we have reached it   9.952114928680668
exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy   10.915620918060357
close the door said la carconte   10.490538086382022
but sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon   8.893714881104028
what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combine them   13.494186213399928
it is my dear valentine said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering   18.618108107868586
what were you doing   4.956185901246098
he would enter into the minister s schemes with the more ardor because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity   16.84344891416388
well listen baptistin what did i tell you this morning when i called you into my laboratory   18.699816705192244
both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking   12.49525636073443
bernouin conducted d artagnan to the oratory where he sat down pensively   17.781597369899995
the curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art one of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time   14.246138634660657
i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker   10.795015781857336
allow me porthos said aramis   16.39922013110622
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room   11.949076086784789
as he gained the top of the rue guénegaud he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him   12.031853705092825
he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom   9.286704145723904
indeed   12.300922069959782
franz remained with m   7.989477555806552
dear valentine said morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen i entreat you   16.397391802831883
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening   12.367725776391307
said i to him   14.029631860975368
as he mistrusted me he determined to guard you himself and sent me in his place to get buckingham to sign the order for your transportation   8.840171240495847
if she caused his death you said that she caused his death   12.626795325416547
the abbé busoni   9.107203579375383
the musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received   20.43356247273038
continued franz   14.656650913033126
she cried wringing her beautiful hands what   0.34831567625332305
noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himself an intervention which had saved them from despair   6.4246537731516575
said the young man   11.706432913061992
it was the marquis de saint méran   10.668238474659667
it was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man   14.04394208966221
yes   16.01293528318249
you are free to night without fighting   10.275085820413846
i recognize this hobbema   9.612068720688722
monseigneur replied porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not safe   17.260460261777283
where   11.487972948666156
oh may god keep me from it and you too   11.950128954093135
three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds   11.463534180850028

we have parted company this long time   15.51497354369515
you serve the cardinal   16.434427013404434
she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks   8.897935291990041
i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections   13.044912597631578
well then said d artagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it   12.887397104024432

cried out winter   15.30636456971351
he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything   12.206389025823992
but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receipted the splendid diamond   16.158952665439045
it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival   6.586611151438465
do you wish me to speak the truth   15.473463080340478
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it   13.335971082726957
and if i am guilty to be shot   11.798980618508281
yes dead alas   17.201153070404654
and your friend still longs to be made a baron   13.040573531461169
d artagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered mazarin s ante room   22.48702016103827
then he looked anxiously at valentine   19.938758553409105
then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him   15.127069375544266
murmured porthos to himself and then said aloud thank you my cousin i am no longer hungry   14.34590363389549
you are the directors of all consciences   11.209109906925097
ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine   14.027674078624928
but to my son in law i would give five and we would share the profits   12.965543409745463
what then   14.836720224201144
edmond and mercédès were clasped in each other s arms   9.23376976692192
said porthos   3.496441634398421
at each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal de lorraine the cardinal de richelieu the cardinal de la valette and the archbishop of bordeaux   13.608758493674618
will you come into the garden   19.857694131481495
but one recovers sir as you perceive replied raoul and we have but had a little bath   11.71915834239857
the fact is count answered the mother agreeably flattered he has great aptitude and learns all that is set before him   18.88029101497882
your order shall be executed my lord   11.706732339325313
the comte de toiras retired into the citadel st   13.381154554670495
but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching murder   19.765038980217053
but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france replied the queen   19.56593728048176
if you have forgotten the history of oedipus i at least remember it   12.981790619718074
but this is not to the purpose our business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in peace   6.070146173019793
ask him then for the written order   11.722653207336183
albert was silent   1.697788262912816
are you not mistaken   10.455089957237206
my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur d artagnan is confined that is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery   19.389151616225654
perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly   13.364258882976428
but you see i make no resistance   14.410913400591042
yes since she lives   10.928329789371181
the four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after m   10.68269828417731
said d artagnan   8.175533492405716
e   15.934914929609128
either to seek the duc de beaufort or the duc de bouillon and to tell them about this   15.097744988305251
i must have lost it said the young man maliciously pretending to search for it   15.762397156559809
really   11.956726611750742
you accept however   15.731666058400963
he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady her first attempts after her arrival   13.201114960773474
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majesty s example and not get killed for your folly in this den   11.941996245328157
the fit lasted two hours   9.565481910940944
young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command   17.831489266255105
still said the governor i believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that i doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead   9.561043916988176
and what may you have to say to him   15.59788776103856
pooh pooh   6.109670193355687
what for   16.333361182134603

madame replied athos do not injure the vicomte de bragelonne do not ruin his prospects   14.396647727015704
the position in which he had left him was critical   12.209124265742869
i can not say monsieur answered i   12.798948453914393
m   10.408547806971931
the words died away the steps were lost in the distance   9.477138497400723
inquired the sentinel   5.703693703912916
it was like a besieged town   7.357373181964154
in short why should i have any more to do with the affair   5.1394234995223735
and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the atlantic   14.401147474652507
now guess what the young one did   14.773631186341941
for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets   6.772780589391979
lucien half smiled   10.772661417458753
so franz must wait   16.380502461628478
take them away juxon   12.687095578742696
in truth said athos aramis is right   2.2896093650797678
or at least i will go later   18.54087211656196
meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on   9.185233636351892
had m   16.27114338034641
alas i understand   10.804588365175013
well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy   13.977130147092
oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man   6.512990854193403
i thought i had not heard aright   16.685134539307526
do you know athos   17.265666862440096
said the duke starting in spite of himself   9.79627395621316
and on what occasion   16.755987901178912
that is to say i am in the king s service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to england i solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms   15.738742958493493
morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly   18.342411311320987
the advice is good monsieur and tomorrow i will set out   17.339540331239174
why what would you have more   19.055966052527108
valentine took maximilian s hand   7.056204789157269
and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed   2.36620919371493
planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same   9.784656480501042
he smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the gascon anxious   14.619912574583813
nevertheless one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away   20.034458989599763
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of   6.645671966097949
replied the stranger knitting his brow   12.434873877084106
the abbé smiled   12.850667198565132
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes   15.050235108426893
oh not much from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs   14.784783067580305

major bartolomeo cavalcanti   6.494824029132874

as soon as societies in forming had invented any kind of police that police invented mousetraps   14.397032783017435
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery   7.468341996095095
if you have seen all madame you know that the son of fernand has publicly insulted me said monte cristo with awful calmness   13.13697399341459

he had married a woman from the village of carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village   11.3271022305486
20199m then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed   12.354826574646642
said dantès turning pale and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards   21.565555836685494
no doubt   8.606308677454477
how have i deviated from those principles monsieur   8.641633222952063
ah his name   8.273199283183837
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart   20.446714870424483
tomorrow   8.108997851029493
but athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made   20.016339688893055
but the first lines aroused his attention   10.606065152345757
indeed   16.096955908184583
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me   13.365051604514692
come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are   17.04568549439029
oh said the count i only know two things which destroy the appetite grief and as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not that and love   17.04958996730677
it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime   13.414648411575714
because tomorrow haydée you will be free   8.121846592959068
but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this   7.406181686514212
no i have never seen him   9.79534732460125
and i also am to fight with this gentleman said aramis coming in his turn onto the place   8.635738174508642
the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor   9.6668315883437
it is at once cruel and unjust   14.547185544610956
well my dear replied athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the enemy   10.58217889592375
well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other   8.894547396533696
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her   16.439470385989477
noirtier de villefort chapter 59   8.551637523311356
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success   13.623819204461274
admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed   12.679547566390585
d artagnan who as we have said was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty then remembered his suspicions regarding milady   12.924614111732387
look again chevalier returned lord winter   14.914017926614267
you see i travel with them   4.786128982532364
scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court   15.708782977505287
it is said that we must not trust to the face   23.967207179991114
it was a sublime and charitable thought said monte cristo and the whole world should applaud it   19.73893829504497
so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general stock   14.077602888771773
but on the frontier he was met by lesly   9.573068647804028
do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys   11.385265841406502
but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy   16.246362795459618
who are you   9.026519787789614
he might be thirty   4.811447048512818
but others wish that you should go there   14.121092064120141
in one case or the other the trial was soon over   17.981094304493357
asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration   11.462061190122872
why has he not painted a spot upon his heart   12.442411963670507
and all these one hundred and ninety one were royalists   11.53517487287538
come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say   15.9809705371657
interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone   17.39449411429071
ah   9.919596172187154
florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same   20.283713356942194
yes said d artagnan   20.032565315696246
idiots   9.177303572762415
it is then the cardinal s custom to walk in his orangery   12.457681841860758
what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego   11.496135260406792
very well until the moment when the comte de la fere resumed raoul said come bragelonne draw your sword   9.43594174948854
as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure   13.04216506905215
let us dispense with useless words   4.176385328885173
to remain silent and dignified in his presence   17.371639303978323
benedetto   16.95823783662769
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival   9.49665774685152
but monsieur it is very natural returned bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished   7.98416445992491
that is to say at the other end of france   13.919218276729442
yes monsieur replied the mercer in a tremble feeling that it was at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing   0.9537437195465621
and raoul what shall you do with him   16.64174216821904
well   18.413981670404215
0185m nearly four years had passed away   9.871566222023992
let us part good friends   12.333187312983913
at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping   10.803485106105425
from th abyss he ll give ear to my moan   10.239045755836177
yes   14.37527527394784
i can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days that is all to athos whose wound still makes him suffer to go to the waters of forges   4.329209455458372
but listen at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing a tempest from the fronde did blow to day i think twill blow sieur mazarin away   10.843691619122712
and have i ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you   13.907599619466652
i have seen russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab   8.228940415581624
albert beauchamp and château renaud remained alone   8.049801339402364
there is a struggle in nature against this divine substance in nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain   7.956716286395074
the pharaon   12.891179099915297
nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the rochellais continued to advance in quick time   19.969963844192844
the cemetery of the château d if on the bed at full length and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form   1.8231309841766699
the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney   8.469879486159192
if my society would not be disagreeable   19.225575626448993
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of impudence   12.767582908802313
villefort fully understood his father s meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders   10.385516655046237
said mazarin and when has rueil been a prison   9.991549136665085
e   17.29387247082652
dantès whirled the stool round his head   14.427832704891223
that one word brings back my mother to my recollection my angel mother who died too soon for myself and all who knew her   9.881513901137573
you follow the world my young friend and i tremble lest grace prove not efficacious   12.450668028842928
i do not see him   11.796755030780856
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window   10.208106096061943
well sir exclaimed mazarin what s the matter   13.793544390122484
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice   16.58637244099227
because you are robbed by your steward   8.658383772893782
i swear before god who seeth us and who in the darkness of this night heareth us never shall my sword cross yours never my eye express a glance of anger nor my heart a throb of hatred at you   11.199030492532266
but be assured my dear monsieur d artagnan that if i had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than myself   11.769873502754908
and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether i can be of further service to you   10.04304426332778
asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own   11.605224923766066
good answered harrison   16.72023569868436
but remember ah   10.364322659132585
why then only see   6.598723352542518
but this is all i have left in the world he said out of an immense fortune   2.4117745842364506
during this brief altercation athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said madame princes who by nature are above other men receive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes   16.867254564148134
then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper   13.56200603313514
grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word pointed   8.368609888012623
you know that we who are true christians are forbidden to lie   9.99117097976142
then you will appear   1.2711339185498538
chapter xxi   18.762811174697717
jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it   10.633167537010912
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen   16.85208026267019
let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded   13.081308935630366
truly   10.301849745107615
at other times he would return home to write a treatise and requested his friends not to disturb him   10.66002894736584
well now what are your conditions if i employ you   8.579195747369328
a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister   19.00486341431761
exclaimed d artagnan impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature the native brightness of his character   11.623649015834555
just so lucien returned morcerf   4.271214242449955
30029m above us all sir was monte cristo s response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered   4.838187602129246
said he showing d artagnan a place where it had been pierced through   15.933300504066871
her first movement was repellent   15.393067175617988
and rochefort went hastily out of the apartment   12.186335660558813
you overwhelm me with joy   9.199486074568265
and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising   15.000483696592713
30115m and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars said albert laughing   11.641105487426376
but the connection will be seen by others and therefore i will have the article contradicted   12.428200755471993
how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster   8.238219764496456
it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous   6.6226089618616655
said the attendant   4.811307796961045
it was himself who was apparently beloved   15.47057298531903
d artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended   15.848786562510087
yes here we are said porthos   11.404173448941808
grimaud contented himself with pointing d artagnan out to his master with his finger   11.162065938043106
he will answer you   13.005623343475007
you   14.774144618611661
and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up   13.498610353674557
duke said flamarens you forget that to morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the queen   15.772208647523602
asked the magistrate   0.8762608939794418
my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity   6.8031383066240485
a case of cerebral congestion nothing more   9.606261905499135
raoul handed the letter to the prince   14.819349895179998
courage sir said raoul to the wounded man   10.723952152306559
m   5.62695820213542
we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve o clock   9.653464913163251
the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people   15.205999352579388
what   6.456720737605982
you are right my dear monsieur bonacieux my friends and i have been on a little journey   8.809932605275423
fly fly   18.05387747401692
half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down   5.9531573673964395
because you have not yet invited me   15.854518426009735
he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest   8.996386029098394
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more   7.555162208884353
the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia   8.327990764065065
my brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of musketeers   7.344360779018558
do you perchance think i set any great store by life   7.143582188421275
those with whom i will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners mount my horses and exhaust my fortune   8.557616903546894
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy   6.776047977651287
they must disappear broken scattered annihilated   2.4780706603741027
said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery   5.162637346583222
i know these lovers   23.55590627394146
and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal   10.729277310321848
by my honor these gascons are incorrigible   16.52133558535665
i wish to thank them all at once   10.597150914876092
here am i milady here am i   9.247700414142685
indeed   15.725718128084472
said the king we shall soon see whether my highlanders have betrayed me or not   1.2234368803769673
the cab crossed the pont neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine   14.396017401531012
it was the most simple thing in the world   10.819562528971389
while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dantès was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clear sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing   6.278189854062702
2   13.598258944059637
no said athos   10.686670760770692
d artagnan translated this for the others   10.925715069479574
said porthos and d artagnan at the same time   11.048929227014415
but from whom did this ring come to you athos   7.341133833848797
the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of d artagnan   5.92689968554404
no i slept as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when i am hungry without feeling inclined to eat   11.555799210490177
in what respect   5.043595922262885
i hope you will not complain now   15.894227261359351
if it belongs to monsieur porthos i wish him joy   13.358873131640172
mordaunt replied grimaud   16.428065819991545
for pity s sake   19.92265246343309
at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself   10.285399377101898
at five o clock albert returned delighted with his day s work   16.341153943396684
but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and i depend on having he his barony and i my promotion   15.099019386986068
said d artagnan   4.624600947515761
what s the matter at the château d if   16.576916630747583
i tell you i belong to the queen   10.677169173528755
grimaud begins his functions   6.020905337916992
who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be   12.395436408340181
so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not i think visited madame danglars twice in her whole life   8.922997789843118
during the ligue about which guitant was speaking just now the people chanted nothing except the mass so everything went to destruction   15.05037904794559
i said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved d artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim   13.523863531117183
yes sir   12.220053176335805
and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor   15.62105934602567
upon these you can live at least two years   13.524952231937778
my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when i hear it   18.73678639618314
d artagnan heard the door close   11.911541660990244
oh as to that monseigneur it is true said athos   11.581242424001456
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st   8.240815624070619
i can see nothing but his back resumed grimaud   7.726491749477113
petersburg the other five leagues from naples   6.885634473887076
mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred   15.225724831448598
let us put down 120 added albert smiling   12.09472157427731
hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them   15.129574039277305
morrel amazed let fall monte cristo s hand   10.859329278762274
i shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a café   8.626911603161062
then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city   5.137666821531816
and aramis pushed forward a large easy chair in which d artagnan stretched himself out   11.157494067738764
we may go then   11.988912862991818
and who recommended this man to you   13.766134847826436
who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him   13.26004044619472
this advice appeared good to the future chancellor   9.767380711569988
then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons   17.164257572297533
the mother and daughter passed the night together   10.030536502020631
he went there to have his beard and hair cut   13.133850579710527
the gascon therefore instead of answering growled out ja   10.587558881756975
he proposed the conditions the two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pistoles   4.638591678565031
well   10.097758019218727
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother   4.847602873969247
do not run down m   6.6207307530651915
each was accompanied by two priests   14.40689713381918
for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy   14.744546817922455
gentlemen   15.7835667203173
is it important that you should go that way   8.6880234364513
it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune   17.453736207824964
he saw d artagnan s movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once   11.672801054089126
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages   13.896003576530564
ah yes   15.209831778099012

yes was the laconic reply   17.165977800711318
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter   10.676878184066656
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre   7.705683494497568
you have seen me twenty times   12.924218221923265
and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance   14.288046784369959
what did he say to me   7.084541641414417

in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs d œuvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grétry and porpora   16.209775520802623
you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us   18.144756333894158
said aramis   15.014403716114877
there are the prince de conti the duc de longueville the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon the marechal de la mothe the marquis de sevigne and i don t know who for my part   6.991358313534697
no   9.297040449320075
ah but you are joking my worthy man   13.49552370458047
haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes   12.082136366589095
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques   13.105717407910976
but remain within sound of the bell   16.978843199213262
oh no certainly not   14.209170386373273
morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say here i am maximilian   10.374863100229744
as for me replied porthos i am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting   16.404772333399503
this athos was connected with three young musketeers named porthos d artagnan and he stopped short   11.951751968766644
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure   6.829856618768887
d artagnan was perplexed   13.570267567605956
the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surgères to mauzes   10.54968869729578
a table was between him and d artagnan   20.73469620218066
is it you baron   15.465058643788517
what the devil   19.842826451936965
to what class of society does he belong   19.902322646149244
this address delivered in the presence of ali who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on m   1.688794343416216
in fact a great noise was heard in the ante chamber   14.061607021005281
the devil   6.739301735394203
because these prisoners sir are at my disposal and i choose to dispose of them as i like   12.392694036083048
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners   14.824885781524925
what can i say more   16.951273023311465
do you know that   7.636070886640664
but they will run against the bottom of the ladder   13.721638153695514
for what purpose   17.813824744266544
the monk s eye again flashed but that was all   17.338642309025467
it was all up with him continued aramis   15.050795949055503
oh you despise them   7.864298859789964
it has hesitated at nothing in the past   9.531287518502642
and why did you refuse my son   9.670684627907237
said a low voice   7.7665070044840965
have i not my talent left   8.710806493903785
she loved villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband   10.243899919402407
cried caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir   16.14008894148311
i beg your excellency s pardon interposed the steward in a deprecating manner for venturing to observe that it is already two o clock   15.493913585663591
de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held   17.071719910732863
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal s baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemy s line of battle at fribourg   11.82187758586719
that one   12.311764314296806
yes   19.330882999128896
did he tell you so   18.027318673504713
there can be no doubt about it thought he   13.30695474367618
we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement   15.113537940581475
valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother   13.160875088449322
anne of austria ran to her jewel case   7.608638875939043
the marriage feast the morning s sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby tinted light   9.197207074854015
why it is indeed a true royal jewel which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier   9.805682212719148
you see mother i treat you handsomely for thirty five francs   13.590323044720801
do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time   9.16922660405773
the sweat started forth on dantès brow   14.402213105220724
in person   10.847882730353604
there now shall we start   12.582318055337637
cried madame de chevreuse clapping her hands   14.465572690435824
so call me mercédès if you please   20.636534510627477
pardon me said he my dear baron but one of my friends the abbé busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in paris   7.647922430684676
the initials are only mine c   8.749948777038009
replied the count with increased anxiety   12.510550780642678
monsieur duke said the king i understand you   7.221496775407737
but don t attach any serious importance dear to what your father said   14.313165345815477
i rest   13.46831495361098
but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed   9.598459927557613
there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony   8.00094165220353
inquired the abbé with an ironical smile   16.65020147178455
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man   11.782675775516205
but you have a wretchedly small garden   8.579082414264334
i should like to offer him a last salute   7.766254231916812
well speak if it depends on me   7.482893520988497
asked felton   14.913336724080576
if i am victorious he will not marry valentine and if i die i am very sure valentine will not marry him   17.66431327333017
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so   6.734963702795508
the officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform   11.566442834762832
then it must be a man of a certain age   8.830073139284345
what   11.560186438581818
i could almost believe myself at the café de paris murmured danglars   14.050004937174716
said the count   18.309310834907794
good evening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial accent   13.630533011746389
exclaimed raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix spare him   8.69674632611197
and what is your choice   9.77646033927553
patience monsieur everything will come in its turn   15.558563982648957
ignorant of their real enemies they do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks french badly but those who can say fine things to them in the purest parisian accent who are their real foes   17.19599843562973
in italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count   5.936734562570164
two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of nettuno and the other as a woman of la riccia   12.089942181950908
a vision chapter xl   13.587936344744294
it is a duel then   17.677680026793173
quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem   9.388386527963256
then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown   7.86367131725586
the queen spoke with some impatience   14.665952515125271
they directed their horses to the city   15.47819218365889
i see spots of blood on the ground   3.7456606120304627
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her   14.766271206651435
but that act of self control effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess   9.892433803873727
on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse   17.483271956573
a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely   11.014465983670727
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you   10.396932470518765
for myself i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand   13.443581086945837
well enough to question him in that language   11.329678404640617
oh well i don t know   7.287588977423962
she asked me not to send the protestants of la rochelle the assistance i promised them   7.577514780623122
you will not be pitiless   12.599653735189722
executioner as you were of king charles   16.673996542787187
we went out   11.741787365274666
and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m   9.312295267484622
other men may have entered before them and waited for them   13.677368186927053
come come tréville hold your tongue said the king   8.972144692564754
ah   6.217242392664153
but de winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply   13.568726592545701
no   25.451957726645063
but andrea drew a cigar case from his pocket took a havana quietly lit it and began smoking   11.771754736161649
i receive him among the number of my friends   13.420868437892526
indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror   10.991940185524763
it seems that your memory is equally short in everything vampa said the count and that not only do you forget people s faces but also the conditions you make with them   14.349504356303473
accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him his blood has thickened   13.85554391867673
when luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded man   15.695619918196453
you know it do you not   9.26101046945219
i confess it   17.339132748652588
and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation   12.952851003653373
oh   11.284177662436436
you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of it   2.0688904363267984
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open   16.999273657286437
making a sign to la houdinière and cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting   7.374729776312326
but he did not return the paper to d artagnan   5.927909285771257
you see i am as exact as you are   13.11512304880347
there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts   18.209372413522868
well then said aramis we must form a plan of battle   17.565255156985593
it is well said the abbé   10.256701176851719
yes indicated the old man   11.474693748634397
said de winter   7.881210744929598
cried d artagnan you were all in the plot then   8.579866243974077
you are very kind   11.875020075983748
god preserved me but a man named brisemont died in my place   10.80061381423297
at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercédès if you ever see my edmond again tell him i die blessing him   11.45557032665079
a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès   10.033114425580614
taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear   9.097450533221355
i dragged myself as far as the yard   19.131857257657654
excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hôtel to punish the insolence of m   7.877700464700291
animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each   12.560706157983164
you must try to see her and have an explanation with her   9.41370159795056
their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other   12.505158990936499
in an hour   13.164755777213866
then as they were only a day s journey from surgères whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of athos and go with them   12.478468218766386
yes ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete   11.444442316018113
how delightful to see you again dear friend   5.692744625777334
come   13.263376210664473
we will attend upon him with a gendarme   12.338564873525973
well bring it said athos   14.184241917869967
replied the king   18.818102220365162
a man   13.773772284937284
then the postscript well   16.246181633356592
on the evening of the 4th of september m   14.501522661299319
no monseigneur   16.128954753312545
go   18.05221614640458
perhaps he would accept   7.944291731010098
impossible madame   14.586750584970172
stop   6.960123807796554
are you sure   5.406788393227979
it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father   9.42510702308457
have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape   12.411761379247372
the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all paris   19.165769933858755
when i shall lay my head on the block and say remember   9.019859220126616
it speaks of his return does it not porthos   18.954657301268767
essed of ingots gold money jewels diamonds gems   13.405624869818988
the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and sausages   19.009655052461785
at this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose   14.710528192208058
asked planchet   5.937647606474727
chapter xxii   15.978338239441424
inquired caderousse half bewildered with joy   8.60637258378414
athos did the same   7.254747172327969
he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham   12.27741088852346
charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip   9.384557474354562
i yet feel his warm tears on my face and his were not the only tears shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also   14.706609233752856
what are you looking at there   14.350396978811583
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her   13.375364476311756
perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons   6.178529805865052
this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured   21.14244436282369
yes we shall yet have happy days   10.433029517275731
yes in italy   13.28124105755937
and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum   7.866976906903934
sighed mercédès   13.768043458093585
and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow   24.93854081244493
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity   13.834312358556714
if after death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered then noble heart sublime soul then i conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me by the filial obedience i vowed to thee grant me some sign some revelation   11.438715165442979
with the queen sir   11.851832540214962
i say sire that there is now but one way open   14.477028212366532
constance bonacieux   17.24551940948606
said d artagnan   9.536008688082601
the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper   20.4806295600428
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords   12.58709884804428
well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another   16.41355047814659
well has anybody come out   10.665112352053765
i have affairs to settle   9.981445064252364
if this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do   16.195259635597772
at length valentine ventured   14.642354877665998
indeed i fear it replied andrea in the tone in which he had heard dorante or valère reply to alceste21 at the théâtre français   13.357249652570854
there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man   6.843752446681096
the spade perhaps   19.123598916067067
how was that   15.452568061390101
our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever   14.36588927901774
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans   12.4591384391439
he was in india with zaccone   22.096899878624598
no no he said to the patron i was awkward and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness   6.137644555175586
for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost   13.351365165863983
well bazin said d artagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more   16.520105622354173
1   14.189560760982076
athos made a sign for his lackey to approach   7.281259093127688
then both mounted and departed quietly   10.356608088314884
bertuccio said the count   12.883026366211388
for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the cardinal   12.732728319204863
the villefort family vault chapter 75   14.40499854493272
no listen to me   11.336948822155948
here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop   12.059761403031766
d artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by planchet at the same pace   9.621062933682742
yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold   13.671897302803554
but now her position in life is assured continued caderousse   11.496447083375557
she could not get out and had heard all   11.348866499842512
three nights   16.651356495346214
well as he means to enter the church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming pope in his turn or at least a cardinal   12.755991593799756
the eyes of noirtier glistened and d avrigny approached   11.703537212928941
i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london and i say to you live sire it is the will of heaven   14.649900632276115
cried d artagnan who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him   9.96979531869368
but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth and making a powerful effort to control himself he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips and went out   18.63056595895141
andrea was supported by two priests   3.8826738850025535
said d artagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet come   13.77299732258723
every one arose   17.181940818574564
i was uneasy about him   5.481566011173984
messieurs porthos and aramis repeated athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman   11.329552277436171
and i feel no doubt that thanks to d artagnan s ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts   12.62026482839954
de tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline   9.69495125195155
in no instance let us say was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions   8.531684524448524
you are mistaken   11.909657414658279
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for   9.259812758511222
this diamond was to have been shared among his friends   15.032979699614291
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand   5.6091318608378815
suppose the poison was for instance brucine brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not   15.38982719262943
yes madame   14.90084939223001
no fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts   15.927406587518952
said d artagnan seizing the letter   14.667143598459116
words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step   9.804437716631806
the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle   13.551646650657519
it is for you or me   13.741882026794876
inquired dantès   8.023596889434064
said the incredulous soldier   13.181032699767265
here are forty double pistoles my dear friend said d artagnan taking the sum from his pocket   10.262376584811822
that man   11.958072540389466
my father is the marechal de grammont   10.34170605650287
replied the commissary   8.073327355953825
enough of this said cavalcanti   12.39189463577577
when the gentleman who came three months ago the agent of thomson french arrives announce his arrival to me   16.038866149547488
you have given me gold   6.079734825247575
for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance   14.809755046252384
a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot   10.855272936853742
will you allow me captain   10.617495353056135
that would be a far better life than i lead now   12.755855836030255
at this moment madame de villefort approached   8.698125516552114
it was in valentine s room   9.30845909666878
your pardon my officer said athos   11.248675172173794
now then all is agreed   17.66975600296293
come in tréville   9.766237115157939
said the king   6.93759445721638
did he speak in your hearing   7.169690120740301
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault château renaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees   18.580402305271306
no no   18.205657101252875
where is fernand   11.510703874613123
the young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the trench   11.391285444635287
that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body   15.91159174056349
the prince read as he hastened on   11.184779606937383
felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand   15.5852054844859
no monsieur jester replied d artagnan   8.067256306303667
s   13.898701439470193
the king thanked m   13.244171540401602
said the king   12.871694723373842
go   11.01499989974899
just then a patrol rode up   2.099670219671294
the king is either a king or no king   14.875141800666453
a totally different subject interests me   9.164908413495365
and if you catch up with them you won t come back to hang me murmured the sergeant   8.71648649287119
who must be now about forty seven or forty eight years of age   12.521559513788999
begin this work to day this instant even and in three days i shall expect the result   11.741641090913465
i have already often told you of this   14.047248041887123
a charming woman was that marie michon resumed athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas   17.170101377225727
i am not an abbé i am not mad   14.159729279663035
you tell me said franz at the moment signor pastrini was about to open his mouth that you knew luigi vampa when he was a child he is still a young man then   9.886071334920398
in half an hour   4.278579048529834
is that you   11.910539870600973
you came through meung where something befell you   11.521831621936824
by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said monte cristo carelessly   7.111730227217951
i am ready my son said mercédès   10.041452912233822
you can not guess said he what there is in that small vase can you   13.421205872418422
at this moment grimaud appeared at the door   16.52755576428044
anne said he you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease knowing that you can do it with impunity   7.823009238234383
notwithstanding all the pains he took d artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new made friends   10.818592402341775
m   12.356724323645489
asked the host   15.736034932798681
i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the father in law and the young man   17.10924490953586
still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month   7.299818077270117
then he went out   13.936970018026367
suggested athos   10.695690128807712
confided to me it shall never escape my lips   11.415874069206549
i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that   9.119036587749155
asked renée   3.423211735813414
that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation   17.923125899547195
meanwhile valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed edward s room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little staircase   11.697295816417558
whether by chance or mistrust the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all day   14.170336925732418
this is indeed the reason why i begged you to alter the order of the questions   7.552010686243086
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law   15.55608000661355
besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else   18.352928616696346
you say this my dear boy   8.877259181956342
but my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the musketeer   9.295060034374165
these horses are equipped for the field   7.814201720856393
said he   5.889699128934831
no i confess it   14.636738636411273
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room   4.935457446839461
in the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddlehorses   17.71492504820205
the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner   8.58800549901783
even on the field of battle i have never done that   10.989210351115823
cried athos   9.948394529146958
nothing replied the latter   6.022376274146177
draw if you please and instantly not so if you please my good friend not here at least   10.701588548266734
i think rather than give pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of offending the count   14.937156270425675
do you think it is to replace him on the throne that cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling   10.74164535328308
peste   10.317017523598015
i do nothing without her commands pray understand that   6.10835180201082
d artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquacity   12.069442596560286
i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugénie   10.913070314123226
40270m chapter 93   11.859372446247251
it is magnificent   14.797530971013362
athos then said to aramis   9.07480866460278
but we always come back to écarté it is not only a game it is a hors d œuvre   9.534468824582385
or solitary confinement   21.339609141600512
said he   10.065452282079914
the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover   13.456254690141648
cried d artagnan and do you suppose i suppose monsieur that you are not a fool and that you knew very well although coming from gascony that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason   16.05016261941848
but what is the matter   19.8639137906124
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed   17.469220959613523
i never lie madame   14.662653156036297
where is he   15.437904474763089
murmured the priest   13.433521484782558
communication being closed by the war i was in want of everything   17.32237943558497
i go to london   17.21873733810211
the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents   10.86381265005194
it was the way in which he spoke   16.92404429233252
answered la ramee   9.86488057136687
what was it then   16.95748978946435
asked aramis   13.44808902467641
i do not see what you have in your hand said selim   12.213216058314718
will you go away from here   7.241296351172055
and don t forget said d artagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two english gentlemen   12.589132747031629
but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal to increase the hilarity of the queen mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes   19.1078763887298
i have an order for each of you also   22.60417952823486
indeed   9.202591112432529
f   14.20562174374171
what she most desires is a letter from her intended   13.47086965734803
it is not like this then said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain   9.211720473485892
not so replied danglars   18.466058184518978
but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years   17.689636253395307
raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground   12.640156890780998
take the best horse you can find   13.924429060422156
i   16.35402197763552
nevertheless to d artagnan s great astonishment the pretty kitty defended herself resolutely   13.090352206940828
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly   6.822384467569116
whom would they hang yourself or me   12.82554877556924
emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered   12.101380015364162
he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus   14.939011407292705
to the seine with the officer   11.020817375415845
here it is   19.364786942094284
the host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which athos went himself to draw at the fountain   10.94477376446681
i have confidence in the remedy i propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy   21.45813543384219
no replied madame danglars i am too ill   13.002579584605156
and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent said aramis   15.032124319788114
how and why   11.676036576215846
oh you know him well my lord it is count de rochefort   13.716830488547913
aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls   15.4394226409572
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth   9.093216000541823
d artagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind it   14.654319098863358
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg 1   6.621082156714482
but i only came back on one condition that i would transmit to your majesty the will of the people   14.49185421909418
your mother will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam which she had from a bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach the heart   12.117515828023508
go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible   13.541351867605076
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke   8.418594775176835
my most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends   7.997582531781899
d artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old fashioned taverns   17.0688510772915
chapter 105   8.795277059617828
then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated   10.33180640184046
franz bowed and left the room   16.642057494137
ho   4.481204819732953
the old father and mercédès remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief   12.868130992939209
in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse   16.03600946049079
just so   12.168498311114723
franz thanked the count for his attention   11.317085461098067
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow   8.652809876042932
she is still alive and i am astonished at it   17.84848554038169
pray who may this famous luigi vampa be   18.782212054216455
at la réserve   12.931299115440007
the shutter where eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed   4.475932578621064
it is absurd said debray   13.539041658121684
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion   7.351420160572166
what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets   7.986738368143067
save me   19.619853890261066
i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene   4.810293701389955
no   10.28547917298597
i will do without a promise and voluntarily all that i can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen   12.930805642794205
his right name was noirtier de villefort   10.331946882944068
replied d artagnan why don t you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch   15.664204939345252
and now are you satisfied with your betrothal   16.25687328293624
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful   16.499597783564525
i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone   9.142594475297862
they are all the same price   17.872955306754754
they went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counter as their friends must have done before them   11.418373410605634
did i not see you the other day smile on the duke of orleans   20.83726970520786
he did not however lose sight of milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face   2.690855983667255
how droll it is   14.64452258807993
d artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning fever   11.014478602059485
i could not repeat the signals   10.015872202991646
both had recently come into the country   16.36961008189293
he converted his chamber into an observatory   12.715388178846935
by the way m   10.020176109367043
one was the notary s   14.635873074066506
no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me   17.699109415868733
that s well   11.681619012843065
the glass cutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him   6.856141207951386
very well   8.781276891325886
come tell me   14.27905528443153
mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him   6.81373663060281
aguado and m   16.989454703599762
arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three o clock   19.348818592563415
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry   14.749970160501157
so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion   10.858391968208489
de tréville saw m   7.1835906063122685
and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothing   8.057452726485717
but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the half uttered bravos expired on his lips   8.77191506904719
a better idea however came into her mind before going to bed   7.379493583893241
la carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so come in dear m   7.385557903253315
aramis instantly seized and read it   13.380088514165298
the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless recollect   15.458228809134717
who is speaking of monsieur d artagnan   16.431893080063894
you expected my son would be a coward   9.221484899850172
oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late diogenes   11.040494349952874
what is that   9.638833743605474
that is well   11.589242677686089
de tréville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the queen   15.91679882131346
i wish continued mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut   11.169164783465048
how s that   10.554481830001665
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition   19.19861131054586
sweet child murmured monte cristo   8.716846565325302
yes   8.176095832911507
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens   7.506715151236562
i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself   9.503367586788695
the editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beet sugar probably a composition of his own   15.136107012702597
only the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and groslow and his three sailors were consumed   7.434413397910294
so d artagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarin s   11.025161112400909
the appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation   12.092225831410419
well said the queen it has been refused   13.05459589065727
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message   13.820848734694188
does your excellency happen to be hungry   5.843028750145468
this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga wines   10.919394647989455
now said aramis we know how the matter stands   15.835977696904672
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom   15.779720144231634
those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather   11.720961218289473
how much did it cost you   9.06927620264047
and he made some steps toward the door   14.775557463949351
yes   12.44616606863401
and while jussac was recovering himself glided like a serpent beneath his blade and passed his sword through his body   11.846335364885547
and with these words henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal raising his hands clasped toward her exclaimed ah madame madame how little you know me mon dieu   12.039352644044174
an hour after her table was cleared   10.508476022078082
the same order was followed in returning nor did grimaud s searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the rue guenegaud and of the quai   15.102755235454682
oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly   17.22886934578238
and therefore i said were our object money only   7.921500948521762
a hundred louis   21.45311400838245
you count who are more than mortal will i am sure lead me to death by a pleasant path will you not   4.418866459886791
but this time the papers were a mere matter of form   15.341395132564605
the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited   9.395950134668459
send directly to blois raoul   10.028900712991778
they are the count of château renaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the round table   9.906896675750673
no time was to be lost   15.573083287761104
de toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemy s camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action   12.379110071734349
then you know that i did not leave him   18.828003926220845
well then i repeat you are wrong   17.342490795535568
hurry hurry   16.90457607762457
then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so   8.365437985841165
and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother   16.022893683317314
asked andrea of himself   9.392336879993898
bonacieux   13.46866700712209
he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at all   8.641271524030417
we intend to visit the abbé scarron for whom i have a letter of introduction and at whose house i expect to meet some of my friends   11.138349030778095
that is the best plan believe me   11.50876341447492
come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general and of mercédès in particular   15.733391530896577
he said to the postilion eh mio caro   19.706017402923738
he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch   12.657280714964337
i saw him from the window madame   12.306232214269533
the writing of madame de chevreuse   4.053713880625743
i quite agree with you said morcerf   13.93164463275295
today the old noirtier or young valentine   16.86432126614627
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem   12.404463345243634
rest content with my friendship for i say once more that is all i can promise and i will promise no more than i can bestow   12.577329885227636
certainly not longer   10.442905824319745
said the queen   10.524265785589197
this was divided into three compartments one which was covered by the floor of that room in which athos porthos and aramis were to pass the night   11.886125941662918
you have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late now   12.82872587214878
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine   10.055039129426781
his countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principles a wicked nature subdued by determination perhaps by repentance   10.617062138288269
should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost   6.453864022068955
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france   10.585782942526766
i wait and listen   5.815596371865608
dantès nevertheless determined to make for them   9.150442994986221
if only we two arrive said d artagnan it will be enough since the duke s troop are only four in number   15.759905837944123
what does he say   14.861806927196538
well then and so he is in paris   16.06373166111923
i expect himself   10.490101336234758
and i said porthos shall make him my sole heir   14.679593955709802
the baroness clasped her hands   15.752791418654322
in france sire at a small port near antibes in the gulf of juan   13.173791034046891
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence   20.127758199395018
he felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress   9.518144165335341
tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated   7.146786779357617
may the devil annihilate me if i return thy wish   11.482771502749967
i recognized monsieur d artagnan   2.533168460104539
by his manner sir and his age   18.455565446488105
for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman   8.156501019801173
sire replied richelieu rest assured that particelli the man to whom your majesty refers has been hanged   14.710238010643366
and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands   7.39063889903063
but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony   12.362397220561776
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared   14.963960344331312
come come   12.315171789778763
said the duke too much astonished to believe it true   11.449881102542689
when do you mean to set out   9.581894273659401
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta   19.095451907312743
i saw the executioner return into the king s room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear   10.95966935005751
my lord as to the report you allude to guitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak out i know nothing but what the public knows   16.42847316365391
and you porthos   9.255589242551801
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest   10.340850202353328
said bonacieux astonished   13.77275659674557
tell them yourself that i was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st   15.426564907100943
i have a presentiment that we shall   12.574550725429779
yes i am the executioner of lille and this is my history   21.233846471258893
it was my forgetfulness then   24.002077507127623
and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing   8.52748399379469
perhaps you did not see well   15.352634027744473
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell   8.82106921870101
franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two corsican bandits with them   17.857719420780835
every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village   15.51105404580255
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet   17.914366962160454
i know him now   15.72974642547441
ah true said the englishman with a sigh   10.261026648037797
it is to pass the carnival at venice   13.095706381703641
i am no swordsman   6.031870194655744
then would come night and with night sleep   11.944949093138463
and you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the stairs   11.592261809134103
therefore when i cough stretch out your arm   14.841841268588233
do as i do   8.053431117538409
because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc   6.4329912044835265
to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine   11.790963039493178
let us talk like men he said looking at the count   14.718398716666162
that evening he had a long conference with several friends   13.90100811726593
asked the latter are you going to be ill just now   10.164580011797876
oh sire what a dreadful misfortune   8.08199569249047
oh   9.169586325303987
brave young man   8.454493205460702
coquenard had since the arrival of porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk   17.07640228422752
a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been disciplined   13.62530728198831
anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings   19.1433712774889
here are five francs for his trouble   6.883046859339018
the truth was that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed teresa toward another part of the garden   13.346454618707018
are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death   16.643977501383056
de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless   16.049184812141583
three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre   11.523418589909447
bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead   11.186343916866495
ah it is no then   14.096052878132285
no   5.040535494065547
he is not dead then   17.02798905442077
but i want to know in what way m   10.797918307591598
and provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine they will require no more of you   10.56428688564666
cocles made no reply   8.702135221211298
coupé thirty five francs   4.570443431933272
besides if they forget i shall take the liberty of reminding them   7.865950033078039
what is your sister valentine doing   7.8137586996571455
de tréville generally held so sacred became in an instant the annex of the antechamber   9.74753858462068
to a convent   10.600896449271936
he ought to aid you in your search   10.16288311681915
at any rate it is a french word   11.815694323727303
directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut   18.388715756991562
this time the poor girl did not even argue with d artagnan   6.1308889546536856
we will then terminate this conversation   12.09484522610412
come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much   9.427636830445616
yes yes repeated the major yes there is a postscript   9.068092579264908
she married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunes emmanuel herbaut   9.184895954735998
asked porthos warmly   15.40885693667956
i saw her this morning and bade her adieu   14.450718762037855
we were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the place royale said the wounded man   14.692380344349354
i have touched the hand of the great man   16.169334818261646
i will see this young man tréville i will see him   14.165891735406257
the pharaon   13.146683804379323
happen what will the devil take them they can t eat us   6.453528254476144
well what have i to do with that   10.46488588735004
and no steel traps   12.463686191571137
this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word   11.458673800334424
said château renaud i would rather end my career like m   15.457374617241614
let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with shame   14.376221963108309
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman   14.388255500437651
the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly   12.125406619969986
gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall   14.341934912798942
monsieur bazin the beadle   6.069126362405
immediately   3.933385842510086
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all   22.54438460507142
then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps   5.727070237538397
monsieur is as usual led by his favorite   16.81246271019824
i the offspring of a noble family who placed reliance upon your friendship i was near dying of my wounds at first and of hunger afterward in a beggarly inn at chantilly without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to you   11.705924714009203
a king said d artagnan   10.206203783097921
not too much so replied d artagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient   6.580206200280275
undeceive yourself comrade you are not monsieur de tréville   4.034503768891977
but you may use it replied lord wilmore   20.01060704528947
suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead   8.562212184335195
saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them   12.952238717833115
cried albert you are not a preacher to remain standing   13.100945784646804
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals   1.8481795314839413
but my dear fellow replied m   18.507294536786244
i know not why but i feel that this crime you acknowledge then the existence of the crime   9.08974402795905
england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise   12.05069684578617
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her again   14.645453808538186
la porte s memoirs   11.491153494000157
you have a park and horses servants   12.367754416802866
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses worth 32 000 francs to madame danglars   8.465179458995058
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut   14.552901707916591
well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i   8.39964296695877
rochefort obeyed and retired   13.5245463370363
total   23.48548320428156
but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a man s head inside the carriage   16.6483352471732
asked the valet de chambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom   8.298069682590992
some contribute their talents others their industry   11.399078566063164
spy cried the duke more and more enraged i will strangle you with my own hands   7.992197833022501
morrel   10.164453224258061
mousqueton grimaud and blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street   13.016812655181129
she with a still smiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone   8.888864510936305
when they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say have you found anything   9.220857224402684
at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her lips   7.55929289176612
then he passed into the dressing room which he examined   6.0778726182477305
yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our own not against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an italian the queen s favorite   10.68483670734472
explain yourself   6.137584893901595
you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort   9.39666680355003
i owe you my real good my present happiness   20.957821458464416
now the queen is of a sensitive nature   11.721936882008045
0027m how could that bring me into trouble sir   8.54521449060072
you are very kind but i may be prevented   13.789500855951808
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia   6.974991033423703
but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more do not advance it   15.56195461699352
in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st   12.623166896196905
it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock   10.890600725121898
there s no second constance in the world   11.77567473517521
his eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tiger cat he advanced toward the hedge   20.93326784766088
now asked porthos what are we to do   13.530787244762896
no i will never pronounce that sentence which would not be orthodox   15.825475546574438
d artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets   15.738188028345286
what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming   11.25812156564489
it is not i who strike m   11.562759850034666
that will fall in wonderfully well   11.162149795782865
he entertains a very high opinion of m   17.894634515623395
your father s name so well known in italy and so highly honored   10.891030608807855
said dantès   11.133450741526426
the coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres   11.720069809087262
no you are right said athos   12.109111635883142
how was that   7.927025433712431
a mantle piece with two modern sèvres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each side one representing homer carrying his guide the other belisarius begging a grayish paper   21.88708573573389
yes and important   13.362241323833342
his looking glass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition   11.464035192182308
d artagnan who as a gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athos s maxim but he did his best to keep up with his host   13.476186190183256
the mandaïa 6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer   7.445459568799604
in about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau   15.949047232889956
asked he   9.902555825699114
but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence   13.316164912328915
it will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own   5.352824709357406
she must have returned to the louvre   17.39421680781453
the affair is still in projection   14.871254067640816
you are mad dear friend   19.1221829356013
and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath   9.771066846931205
observed one of the bearers   14.383052708310291
noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal   8.736353825049513
probably not   23.566946335820084
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone   15.38464257397337
oh unfortunate   13.500257669759796
and as was well known the vengeance of his eminence was terrible   15.427955167360466
for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her character perfecting a beautiful vengeance   3.1735593456221647
perceiving her brother in law she uttered a terrible cry   7.108233255667558
come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair   6.298817691331209
and besides i am on my guard   9.145974321189847
they both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moonlight   9.356951001698913
tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old man s madness   9.632076698822393
he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything   6.352702115192019
you shall pass it by twenty fathoms   18.520932633265115
you think the count will be angry with me   12.399337235997713
it was the first time franz had ever seen a guillotine we say guillotine because the roman mandaïa is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument   16.267765465407393
parbleu   9.399251011884218
might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him   9.2137240448234
asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone   2.5078994049657464
so you were at the races baron   21.94278486416858
odds fish   9.9537871020639
said the latter   10.292838017592741
let us see the dungeons   12.271260121698191
what have i to do with politics   13.071288100748509
planchet   17.433082129466
mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door   13.765449633028728
she suited me in every respect and i would have married her   15.727994430204602
d artagnan sprang back   5.603296128148782
you jest   9.287323790045747
0091m that is true answered the marquis   11.57015605339491
yes my lord   16.28826946927401
said monte cristo smiling   13.428653391945709
some traveller seems impatient said the host   26.448869730958613
eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge   6.576868708848476
i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless   10.292629722375612
are the carbines loaded   15.189320857894348
it seems as if i were listening to the story of a dream   3.6091083795679317
but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes   10.043112232125594
whilst d artagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris   4.0257995647592395
take it and deliver me from your odious presence   13.83514873012391
go and call upon him in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine   4.689203207284928
what is that   12.092955545245546
m   14.914007436687035
when he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening looks   10.61810671123188
after going about thirty paces he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac   1.755759106432789
but he stopped on the landing   14.949277912561834
in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road   13.722181034037497
without you i was a dead man thrice dead   14.609789426312005
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant   8.823579019343468
the matter is gallant   19.159616923907002
but on rising from his bed of justice on the twenty eighth of june he felt himself attacked by fever   14.47282622788416
though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of harrison and the king   11.714554254749288
i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherd s life was vampa s reply   12.730649887277268
20185m gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable   9.540851073848948
she had one hope which was that felton would appear at the breakfast hour   11.129215104530239
i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me   9.401536012553674
pardieu resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman   14.567548921460908
sir   13.47950159759838
you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria   13.139523924924534
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent   14.3229850569067
franz coolly cocked both barrels   15.306732964691355
he asked in a low voice   11.768083370649771
let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of it   11.235860178738246
there is no harm in trying to buy things cheap monsieur porthos said the procurator s wife seeking to excuse herself   11.67855553678115
here are the august signatures of your majesty s hand   10.736857567496477
but the precaution was too late d artagnan had already recognized mme   12.885817008322574
1   12.378220605711615
on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied d artagnan without his sword and the three musketeers armed   11.447092991186528
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber   8.177134346159333
8   3.449377176876352
she asked d artagnan if he had a mistress   6.575763131332832
comminges glanced at d artagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up   16.011705334432452
now my dear guitant i have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable memory   15.368422838307009
villefort looked at the count almost with terror   9.120983452072739
captain said the young king to d artagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to day you and your friend the baron du vallon   13.33742010377032
do you fear he will not understand   12.398350266241273
said albert with a thundering voice   13.869907780745077
i am just falling down with fatigue   18.112645759033086
and passes his time   12.421830432441142
you are a simpleton said athos   7.469457303005108
i don t understand it at all   14.807066029124218
without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with   14.03388709095338
neffer neffer   11.792020678658396
i shall hide myself in your cabin   20.147795611353956
has anything particular happened in the neighborhood   11.168206674670165
are you superhuman   15.693042341300199
but when aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light that is to say with all its advantages   0.695320317263084
you have a sister   18.136808697389135
oh   22.212725157471322
but as good luck would have it just as i thought i should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken leg   14.493939745889527
it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dantès   10.47715702780886
you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier   15.557020776282972
but how could he risk the question   15.276439006177123
today is the 29th of august   7.290002965463761
you lie   12.887344609732818
i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you   10.04326277671608
noirtier   17.473464744944152
ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured edmond   14.066541166841693
i told you that yesterday madame made inquiries of me upon the subject   19.327660968682146
i was trying said porthos to recall where i had seen that mendicant whom i must have killed   11.155485368376157
dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew   12.547532778253018
well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name   5.078045694905734
there s a providence that watches over the deserving   9.260043438600825
i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself   8.979578072923212
but to day is not the proper time   18.382686589982228
if the king consented to see them they would only have to be called   16.2839001595377
felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word   12.161456386182973
no sir replied anne of austria and you may retire until the time that i mentioned to you   3.9351581716213015
ready said he with his usual curtness   10.82708791197543
it is true she said the arch hypocrite see   2.56055271016959
and what kind of a man   10.106709331323549
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace   12.826073635431923
was the cry   3.7113105434607547
you tell me so i believe you   15.533505731259746
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord   12.71271693747552
peter s   9.3270783802974
yes said the old man   7.159489379527272
and he as usual has refused   9.73348951686347
your family name is monte cristo   16.7321076083375
well be on our side now resumed aramis   18.365412999003524
besides d artagnan has not told us his idea yet   10.169475157675471
you have cut her to the heart   14.71621434637316
do you hear   16.574383590058662
one day he carried off a young girl the daughter of a surveyor of frosinone   8.040821710008085
keep quiet while my master is being arrested   5.168556896126874
30333m valentine trembled convulsively   9.511062766115428
yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him   14.23855654897944
asked the cardinal   16.941774733645765
the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugénie used in leaving it   2.0665404017384343
yes   6.452113849542405
he cried   15.396358034266163
i now remember having had the honor of meeting you   8.755834115188193
come in come in said albert rising and advancing to meet the young man   18.324967990686925
villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars   17.96763984766803
they are mostly foreigners scotch irish or danish   17.385086511364022
what i most loved after you mercédès was myself my dignity and that strength which rendered me superior to other men   14.606958557506086
oh no   7.426188752362001
we make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money   13.345884622153033
the peasant started off running before the prince s horse   6.095161518182007
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardon you from the queen we from mazarin which were we all four together would never be granted   20.68553424468273
swear it upon the cross   10.71266474306617
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair   15.371942567555225
didn t i say that your police were good for nothing   6.720755659146692
no   14.009984164013995
it was you who believing that de wardes had deceived you wished to have him killed by his rival   15.909427882171455
at what o clock sir do you breakfast   9.792671700011061
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers   14.613605941346583
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs   19.18463737919747
besides what is required of a young man in paris   13.016218444374374
answer   11.976304583816166
cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital   13.665101079208453
it seems like a woman   7.792393197934827
keep watch from seven to nine   2.5950591161159906
you monsieur le comte de la fere to the right of monsieur groslow   10.799473479733491
then after an instant of gloomy reflection come i will go to see the morrels said he   12.47648752794066
yes my lord   10.17790257717409
for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed   18.500565663494925
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first   12.479697092253385
added athos coolly   15.080254158295002
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference   12.83754583124817
he said respectfully   7.2013638539102
yes as far as i am personally concerned   5.595382025458393
albert returned safely then the count was revenged   11.652001531202192
in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the cross roads   12.0108251558409
she is beautiful   8.150131762842488
almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning   6.251401666766391
well i will mention you to him   11.48996860986048
but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother s voice when she enjoined me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given   22.481863169554874
that shall be testified to rest assured   3.454744711180723
it seems a likely story to me   14.138866988020006
for albert is brave resumed morrel   19.103211225373506
let us not lose a moment   10.96826835851867
it is not for you to interrogate but to answer   13.328303555710672
asked d artagnan eagerly   11.337667068520714
our cargo was to be landed in the gulf of lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829   11.319281815527436
that fellow is no fool said aramis as he got on his horse   10.53034817376036
gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through   8.88572947349996
one thing still puzzles me observed dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight   9.926052848436143
s   13.573726976475992
and i will pay you or i shall be dead   9.605838706982773
the cardinal knows everything   9.410322760751423
the ballet of la merlaison chapter xxiii   12.798799021809568
milady smiled   16.489582378417914
the chancellor sequier who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly stood before her relating how his carriage had been smashed how he had been pursued and had rushed into the hotel d o that the hotel was immediately invaded pillaged and devastated   12.826593632606109
but entirely on account of her precautions the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty   17.53640070724638
coquenard s chamber   10.874047245179609
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience   8.417113987950758
so would i said porthos unwilling to be behind d artagnan in generosity   8.993970014599299
whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel   10.890590909886384
this movement revealed the spot where winter s body had fallen   6.343286609909669
you will then have our swords with which i can assure you my friend and i can play tolerably well   9.292996472657062
he asked what was going on   8.978796564819595
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune   13.785885676646757
but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer s house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac   12.16143010010687
you know to what i allude danglars it is sacred   10.840663211339404
exclaimed athos anxiously   15.135278430172868
it consisted as we have said of a small dressing room opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone   10.154081563454508
no sir   10.876891041160125
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened   14.20923024640378
by denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow   3.2591977481423005
25 in the rue de vaugirard   21.15425938001679
yes sire   7.9344170279728425
you are a careful fellow edmond   16.83905242062075
st   14.33037735572013
you have asked for me   18.47981052456086
the devil   6.73922291791887
the deuce   0.5719822674621078
must i say baron danglars   15.024926440093745
almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment   15.65740157543008
the corpse was conveyed to the morgue   13.69982863394148
will your excellency give your name or remain incognito   10.900385424206613
andrea visibly changed countenance   9.841131177721085
the executioner said d artagnan and aramis at the same time   10.505307789904926
well what has happened to them   5.240927846040746
anne colored slightly   8.113475973416014
hearing the name of morrel who had left him only two hours before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him   8.042384631190863
bonacieux which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of aramis   7.927468500579526
asked athos   11.920939246285256
for the story   15.141340881400268
on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out who s there   3.730453558427426
who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension   15.131057064527734
the château d if   12.3307564447622
do you want me to go away   11.100619002163743
tomorrow evening at five o clock   4.687250794797251
athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure   13.69348179425665
then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room   9.058005255785506
i shall come back to dessert   14.666956546606999
why so   13.28239347678543
then we will not talk of it until tomorrow   20.01495020938161

and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos   16.03384009565618
in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire   18.430320486761104
i love edmond dantès the young girl calmly replied and none but edmond shall ever be my husband   10.703499107698374
22 literally the basket because wedding gifts were originally brought in such a receptacle   2.1264623129526345
bertuccio my steward takes me for a roman   9.099317194646382
you well know that our interests are the same   11.09945858801526
i wish to consult you about some thing   19.28881791956881
pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars   6.205324600514695
that credit sustains him as breath animates the body   13.390924867899725
i shall have further need of him   13.952091240494799
at your age   14.41281523248643
i can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of us   19.938852026391377
be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to sufferers   15.516013655855067
the count felt his heart dilate and throb   7.884619679828972
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat   12.452937471611135
porthos had discovered the means the diamond   14.762136610787067
yes why   21.61448698814649
one might have thought there was in that cellar one of those famished ogres the gigantic heroes of popular legends into whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity   11.346363872909917
he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to command   12.432548218123967
you are wrong replied villefort significantly   12.255720735490817
he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen   19.188912916789945
i breathe more freely   11.506635516148746
he cried   13.495616610886751
for my master   9.93519970389027
you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general   13.507545809479515
he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner   10.904424372744765
oh my heart   10.6307959774236
in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search   17.682668311191474
if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received   4.366670123404731
come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m   11.999940478395361
they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the feet   8.226590014969076
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to act   9.381948216756376
monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face   11.095497693014794
oh   15.90231384972141
perhaps it will be too late said gondy still unmoved   15.92119479147131
two months ago you were dying with hunger   7.898062987892025
but do you stay   5.510000533763362
they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey   12.446170901521938
and m   12.11406758196066
the young men first approached the dead man   22.2802687058825
i promise you my lord never to part with it replied athos   12.365887851337003
and dantès happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend s mental instability glided like a snake along the narrow passage   9.362055592918658
the ball struck the animal full in front   15.650076776573687
or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police   13.2594291435559
this was a good omen for morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine   5.529302887606405
you well know edmond that i am no longer a reasoning creature   12.970462355129433
ah   13.155164732267405
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental d artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance   13.153302932342918
thus did athos and aramis make their appearance in the ante chamber where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting   7.010257865672455
i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky   20.21949257901099
bonacieux   8.555078955748812
it is an affair of importance on the service of the king   6.345048922567845
i do not care where i live said kitty provided i am well concealed and nobody knows where i am   9.01684267773853
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream   12.447413846719307
no valentine for i have foreseen all their plots   7.750509919497336
or richelieu for two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence   11.419469873592892
we must go replied villefort offering his arm   11.461296485402212
you know her it seems   12.207661700994134
no said winter then he paused   18.441666485237768
the perfidious deceiver was as may plainly be perceived already sacrificing in intention the poor girl in order to obtain milady willy nilly   16.10063503484213
to know what   13.559661735276087
madame de saint méran wished her daughter should be married there   15.132083561455733
they both came immediately m   6.975713643167835
d artagnan thought of the appointment mme   20.42401464215625
d artagnan bowed to mme   12.49190982147993
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m   10.058840041506391
he almost immediately got up and took his leave   15.041260159509378
felton uttered a groan   4.4131898403035255
i am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested   18.958557180429576
yes for time presses   8.821601899875699
you will come to me or you will let me come to you   13.13202051421725
i faith colonel said d artagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation   9.557804430506206
emmanuel went towards the pistols   16.985428690255382
yes my lord   9.881548723912545
ah   18.300626412875936
the queen entered the great hall   8.508094241520048
the guests looked at each other   5.684908269421673
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg™ license when you share it without charge with others   12.02675371343892
if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew   14.747492695245175
he said   15.1587195785676
it was that of la carconte   13.48364214070963
you will force the last drop of blood from your veins   12.028732072611056
exclaimed athos extending his hand to d artagnan   13.212321226313788
what are you doing   10.162302464876884
this night i have had a fearful sleep   2.8091784744769637
we are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we pleased   18.165469765023705
d artagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact   7.311382800542474
i have seen him eat of everything in italy   19.78253579526881
signor luigi continued albert is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency   13.294381075638983
you have eight days to return in all sixteen days   8.793649739643547
said d artagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself   6.893736843839638
which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the englishman   11.345151934459352
franz was less enthusiastic   9.147834484588701
of what did you make your ink   9.926124357616716
only he was very pale and trembled slightly   15.265115401507169
but he bethought him of m   16.707474003863926
true i had forgotten it   20.227807367150724
president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i can not follow you   10.252843879024677
one only needs to be sharp that s all   10.461632635839152
that of being your invalid answered scarron   8.033617240439657
possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately   9.709442184860745
i will go this very evening to tréville whom i will request to ask this favor for me of his brother in law monsieur dessessart   7.6994321114807835
de morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina   22.25867070071351
asked porthos   14.92513746296595
i hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend   9.40643309325393
mme   18.077244738788615
certainly continued monte cristo i make three assortments in fortune first rate second rate and third rate fortunes   13.715123121703645
still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders   14.327198314407257
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation   7.189771939846014
said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the other officers   5.817140622171913
cried morcerf turning livid with rage   10.127947536889703
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornélie   10.93202571422118
in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate   2.2117421641398245
he turned towards porthos and aramis   17.39162190366707
the worthy shipowner knew from penelon s recital of the captain s brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him   13.229473036294767
it is with madame   10.874659557207643
the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse   16.704220675090426
it is not aramis   6.334975361149654
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened   5.620470511190132
by the bye continued d artagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body   11.487381480085272
he turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance and holding out his arm to him said come i will not abandon you thus   10.347917245299323
what have i to fear replied d artagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties   14.108377216237011
the astonished president looked at the jury who in turn looked at villefort   7.386445175765586
my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women   20.107939740297656
d avrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done   12.785560367355641
the king s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity   14.01476954969823
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour   16.86483881060589
you yourself gave me this comb   11.411395626371998
that s his province   8.048826119764074
accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following   20.90386747745419
and what name does he now bear   8.253749156932736
without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the ice cold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom   11.232122623355272
i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience   11.091217679082735
then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron   15.769980598950962
when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil   6.3196409955461466
that can be managed   17.543249757384398
count said albert in a low tone to monte cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her history   10.018458414784359
in former days i had not only three friends i had thirty   7.189423632796272
cried milady seeing that on this point as on the other lord de winter seemed well instructed   11.986074860901638
he found buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own hand   8.716866000295221
to kill yourself   9.560049511221859
here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man   22.216509576136104
and he went toward the door of the second compartment   3.493975878914336
one day he miraculously left the prison transformed rich powerful   16.968320839616034
if he comes out we shall catch him   12.45880620646745
but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him   10.862098946629159
well said beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend   11.182205974598519
i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek   10.854921706674856
in an hour it will be at the door   13.719943234128907
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand   9.784122246509119
they reached the queen s apartments but were compelled to stop in the ante chamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from england   12.006222901040207
d artagnan let me confess to you what i ve been thinking about during the whole of my drive as i looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes   9.047087935682722
the truth madame said mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must   3.5028692560837804
she asked upon what day this fête would take place but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head   15.548612454793595
danglars said baron i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugénie danglars for my son the vicomte albert de morcerf   17.72552965343652
are they all full   13.558115818188483
i do not think he is   18.408955430804614
nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends   8.163683312103407
bonacieux knocked as at the shutter three light and regular taps   16.033063859174923
said porthos sobbing i believe i m crying   10.02824655699295
cried mme   8.734409867454314
porthos do not lose sight of his eminence   15.060194325352402
persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldn t have too much information   10.30821647979042
in that case i will go   19.081615002358472
but what i know is that i will not be perjured   8.656383726818849
behind this wall   18.409249074345954
the breakfast room was finished in oak   13.140648766323691
and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle   10.698268455661212
2   8.791419842223238
if one s lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly   11.840782972319738
said porthos it appears we are feasting   7.924559296197645
and all this all this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping   19.109915165658027
for what you have just said   10.572589302483777
don t you see how you are frightening us   9.727535344978623
and so on progressively   9.796492201191025
and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited d artagnan s reply   13.329449194474378
i do not know that   16.017249942014637
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited   21.016092999614
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the ante chambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landing place have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt   16.389896006980898
why   15.219246963210113
then we do not see those beings to whom you allude   4.267075026777282
certainly if milady s strength had been equal to her hatred mme   12.59836995047266
this fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred iron sided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place   12.826494709792053
at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log   18.10068264049528
toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime trees   14.010274689471586
said old dantès   9.01599876093201
you are still at the hôtel des princes   15.537298712467551
but he could look and with that look ask assistance   8.018756152163878
the beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms   4.044250182143665
as he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the darkness   16.274161252169566
no matter said d artagnan in his most wheedling tone   13.567790353717493
how monsieur   8.819051125871056
nothing but saddles   15.506198027389773
you knew it and said nothing   15.454843597470065
blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension   13.293983745829795
are they capable of attempting violence   20.406250748796772
and you understand that they would have saved the king   8.370724138662357
the morrels have been shipowners from father to son   14.805141281311663
he ordered the carriage therefore for eleven o clock desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the hotel   13.901457676791763
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos   8.420488015559483
and that you may not forget me take this   9.343543165249322
that is never done   12.251765045049497
let him come in then   11.186467258787463
you must be much fatigued after your voyage   1.0480459682250185
i have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times   10.344194347232447
you have rightly guessed madame replied the count   12.683145918434745
you are indeed a nobleman   9.965481650261733
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below   10.453532866081193
de motteville will not be astonished at this reply   9.548798550061646
nobody knew   7.699127334086387
then he approached a little piece of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous visit   19.289910617921915
and what are you afraid of then   14.349558229805314
he answers only by signs   9.748532962117551
what can you expect athos   8.77505630121471
eh   19.55660368914858
i wish there were four said athos   13.350778005051716
asked d artagnan   8.234747641745459
what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silver are they all for me   8.922743793001551
you think so   7.727121745584966
and he sent them to you   12.016742504943043
said he however far i may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners i warn you   9.544387079417877
it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristo s name announced   16.660028042404512
the queen standing near the door d artagnan half out of his hiding place the king raised on his elbow ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude but instead of approaching the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away   9.436726382695557
my god   13.876952746926216
but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague reports   3.3904048569142518
surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate   11.04025015868741
the king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the palais royal   20.643281221117565
i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence   12.605185593533887
but you have made my mouth water   9.090582837854488
do you aramis order the servants   12.57256762604551
she saw vaguely the future   13.327074023142663
at five o clock replied the count   7.413467811908354
felton reappeared and without observing whether milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready spread   13.500534134471167
the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds   7.812855627185731
said morrel intoxicated   16.66865224357152
de tréville   13.138118410646921
in that case i am the man you have to do with   15.462780955938046
she will save us said conti   8.762318239313114
we depart from one place and arrive at another that is all   11.194756509715601
i repeat to you i don t know her   8.952638517276009
the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day   10.580023364490366
the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape   17.04789982386079
m   10.023075264340543
the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place   13.020721195324597
he had formed his resolution   4.5965875606605815
the tocsin was sounded   8.009526338730792
really count replied franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world   13.453289757134975
we will return   8.949711788200405
he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night that s all   11.780638582357948
e   14.35057635718504
exclaimed athos   11.095668553675093
albert listened with the most profound attention   6.838640421558652
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light   16.833635819405274
de tréville s as nine o clock had just struck and as planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task a knocking was heard at the street door   8.553519436406368
the servant soon returned   16.876147363285643
no if you have heard me distinctly you will understand that you are not to die on the scaffold   16.942135411921747
you only mentioned four persons   16.481869400092826
this man is still your friend and you perhaps make use of him as your accomplice   19.31139291924487
what does porthos wish for   14.57903812389758
i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side   14.322307088214593
he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party   17.595844246704686
give me a simple assignment of your debt   10.21528637226205
the steward could not restrain himself   15.75735624386701
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach   7.757103961489153
let me kill him   16.55731461391761
he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him   12.405500140205815
but upon the first step he met lord de winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying i knew it   12.654170672204312
true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together   12.918703999600005
shall we see you again to give us any information   14.300940161188027
it was alas   11.338270939858731
you have two or three times mentioned a m   9.46384620094596
i have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds   17.672715644444793
i understand said monte cristo   14.509094733539543
but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us doubt   12.113221292960962
without the saddle   6.9915012316246745
they ask my name i can not give it since my parents abandoned me   14.227834237783602
this voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gallop   13.170832326234265
he exclaimed   12.738288628171254
poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much   16.50387339410468
yes you re right replied the companion   12.574534882900755
nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain   15.970541392854834
and the frenchmen how did they behave   6.582130536308074
why so   12.889537740939494
in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom thanks to his great youthfulness he hoped to intimidate   9.286676596169048
the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered will be questioned   12.27189166369021
when i said rich replied the procurator s wife who saw that she had gone too far you must not take the word literally   17.9795724242011
and what have i to do with your ill humor   11.326604986920948
my mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my father s heart   13.09486376547485
i saw then that we were descending a large staircase   3.97775297703458
monsieur de comminges said athos i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders   14.000211992306514
he understood the old man s meaning   18.83361712585861
gutenberg   13.222492467483864
d artagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed   17.394996027835525
yes sir   12.054722037811093
athos had been out since six o clock   18.999143247993025
your name   13.28066068459781
aramis my good friend this time you are wrong interrupted porthos   12.88141593128555
but this fire   16.62692088453741
and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier   12.747749709174043
s   8.181696638638105
9   7.927774648231481
bertuccio bowed and was about to retire   20.67983155419757
no dear morcerf   14.559049639343389
org   13.48985426193612
they all mounted the horses as quickly as possible   9.008485105051669
go now at once or i shall have you put out   15.682497433053138
ten millions   16.56554391055482
gentlemen said athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together   10.671784023599225
before leaving the scaffold aramis had approached the opening where athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king   6.784370518338493
and do you know whither he went   12.312668552027855
we parted at hyères   12.757253448234756
that i might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man   9.864839365416145
the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the rue richelieu   15.827684004220078
and you what will you become   9.239962211052259
we must fly said the queen   14.407576564241365
yes   10.614136076887231
make preparations for departure   9.778484849602785
oh monsieur cried dantès you have been rather a friend than a judge   12.921309152058516
do as i bid you show the chevalier out   12.036969185645914
it was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket   3.3554547450142067
his fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself   10.225197235306826
but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me   6.835466646668209
he will enter by this door   12.186386331544751
it is over now and i am much better   6.204374449471244
d artagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand   7.787887778867142
evening came   9.720118845838721
the second night the door opened   14.981241684464003
demanded porthos   9.124012872831301
at each shot morrel turned pale   17.479912187144205
bah   4.83332105407143
incorruptible   14.189925688344541
said morrel   9.96163142831871
besides you sent me word that you would come to me and i have held myself at your disposal   20.07763232490783
the country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald   8.55852031058076
d aguillon his mistress and mme   12.328623551522877
we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and i to mine   7.112926725003824
while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order   10.510739222918765
it is god s pleasure that things should be so   14.357684565145366
and mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them   14.745896148855806
doctor d avrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall   14.944586484549813
at five o clock anne went to the cardinal s room   13.44901818709868
danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs   16.04501470532121
every one withdrew   9.553505313026383
yes   12.411115731078109
the baroness ascended the steps   19.120209014698133
the innkeeper shivered   19.2687255513769
no said villefort burying his face in his hands no a hundred times no   6.615121923496062
repeated madame de villefort   14.677561576001914
here or in the neighborhood   11.017900845048883
i know it cried d artagnan   17.441195122173454
ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades   11.711584737933388
i should never have thought of that said porthos and yet it is very simple   18.892308788704096
the moment the little troop passed goskal and were approaching the post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his lips   13.638958873218217
they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic   10.997287100442604
in that case i should beat a retreat   9.931412657425776
wait here to receive the troops   12.000035051063143
exclaimed lord leven   5.21607314572579
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole   12.34198880403612
then the door opened and he appeared   11.020871546777297
the young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old man s forehead where valentine s had been   13.972325297308537
monte cristo lets fall his purse   19.445931180420647
from pure zeal and devotion then   10.307722512708054
it is a bad year for kings said gondy shaking his head   13.714873600254235
do not mistake   14.204579303745984
d artagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features   18.23636523891423
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he   9.371172608323956
excellent   12.476425402937235
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier   5.269181565886532
there ought to be some money in that secretaire   14.267002786526728
20033m such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with m   8.960948378822094
the spanish one you mean i suppose   10.02459291283043
let him be sent for instantly   11.92291932643291
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that d artagnan had not come to béthune   16.430399183414277
the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud   10.71959452091069
nay indeed your excellency   16.173923413242104
but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour   8.320985175043987
what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog   12.226405792944385
50055m bah said cavalcanti crossing his arms one has friends   20.937948241822404
chance   3.311248923218109
and you believe he died of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse   11.709586679810696
softly gentlemen   11.940639240611167
3   11.129396072299915
but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before   11.139421292730889
but the real adieux were made in mme   8.115445203019739
which the duchess de chevreuse or the duchess de longueville   6.731817078146709
then his master having admitted him barricaded the door afresh and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar   11.904191629426098
unless i die i shall always be what i am and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard even from the mouths of kings for kings have need and other persons have fear of you   11.9458350564213
how will you have them protect you   15.408074242881352
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other   11.654029648075355
said château renaud   11.89538988925505
ah my dear father   13.94848942031186
d artagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains   11.808116928778707
she exclaimed falling back   9.077091287796488
take a post chaise or a carriage   9.6966627119109
oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny   12.351598590652864
why it was he who carried me off   11.936903409527655
but what then   11.00349713597314
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender   16.902940682891078
let you sir   16.39159222991249
as a punishment   11.70828436117365
pray tell me how   14.583141492107838
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety   6.668350463490613
how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpent like forehead round vulture shaped head and sharp hooked nose like the beak of a buzzard   9.969482785842802
from whom then   14.203263161972089
you who are in power have only the means that money produces we who are in expectation have those which devotion prompts   9.842793598005915
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers   19.512948324990987
thought d artagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived   13.205191859540296
i think you are going mad bertuccio said the count coldly   8.437516905287834
these arrangements made the lackeys retired   10.05094244927422
d artagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward   8.076897576997442
i have no doubt of it   10.353437727391515
but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest   11.376153782706618
it was d artagnan who now shook his head in his turn   10.813432378043487
as a skillful general seeing the enemy ready to surrender marches toward him with a cry of victory she rose beautiful as an antique priestess inspired like a christian virgin her arms extended her throat uncovered her hair disheveled holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young puritan and went toward him crying out with a vehement air and in her melodious voice to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy let this victim to baal be sent to the lions the martyr be thrown   13.701193855558166
pshaw   3.6795408012525215
is it possible   17.02545877914843
yes it is so long ago answered porthos   11.259284008310924
pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing   10.475096382651234
leave the box sir   15.12173311184718
said the queen   14.823256464956032
and throwing his arm around the young girl s waist he pressed the hand of valentine and disappeared   16.407549677354098
but said caderousse again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed you must pay for it you understand   6.041294519620881
yes with count cavalcanti the marquis his father madame danglars m   13.76784979893382
read   11.168502847729524
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement   12.540123422144294
but one person only wrote   10.682537959243065
his brow was more pale than it generally was   4.253594918771686
count said villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes   15.652517935675325
she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed   14.28257600384859
asked the gascon   15.152745636130543
let him have it let him have it she said   13.06892306692389
when crime has been committed and god doubtless in anger turns away his face it is for the physician to bring the culprit to justice   13.70728910548068
after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier   17.476265985170713
i say you are a miserable creature   8.121362262632971
mercédès is not accountable to any person is she   19.954105146511985
the events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then i will add them to my list of crimes   8.770263950677277
well i am wrong   16.656760616741206
besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of 100 000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality   15.326405966841765
she wished to see me to speak to me   11.929048913006982
what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas   18.72580671875039
bonacieux took place   7.5897562406376275
but you are sure you will promise me this   21.016917317904024
noirtier closed his right eye   7.15520745880578
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier   8.659584143852292
but my dear count has m   15.17350552823187

he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint méran s death recurred to him   11.411643496038593
i have sailed over it since my childhood   13.292958801270196
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe   12.847425216575783
my only regret is not having seen d artagnan   5.183845715831273
at the moment of arriving at st   6.392975507691157
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop   14.253941687705222
a voice of strange sweetness   5.126298628482944
so that thanks to her friend s generosity teresa was the most beautiful and the best attired peasant near rome   14.773884065572489
ten would have destroyed him   15.761325089071624
demanded porthos   14.350804301596522
i own that this woman terrifies me   14.36499559415098
at your return i will give you a surprise   13.706659577162085
the coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the affirmative   15.052212151038074
tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safe conduct which he had given me   5.831815473787448
that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs   18.368513490648787
something whatever it was the cask contained fell silently into the tankard   13.525765843787728
sterlets said château renaud are only found in the volga   14.776617460970689
well let it be three weeks then said morcerf   23.18853798507952
exactly so   7.88452944624248
bonacieux   15.907004371766037
will you not see my sister once more   11.812114494629213
how   14.541953538957669
ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him   6.109205445625588
and to think that i couldn t find that out said porthos scratching his head   16.639284564018002
i asked you if you knew him   17.369309942326154
ah yes   16.808036073994558
to purchase back my liberty   10.487696017990764
it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim   16.489913631280398
if he persists his eminence made a pause and resumed if he persists well then i shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states   12.900922167828819
when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same company   10.402620640613868
yes   11.562649449429603
he is speculating in railways said lord wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection   14.375719054764666
is treated at the court of france   8.663700118104183
murmured the abbé   8.453411364771663
once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the queen s   11.30360676291088
it is the counsel of a madman and i should be more mad than you did i not stop you at once with the word impossible morrel impossible   7.5702674721094985
the officer desired to have milady s packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the boat   20.52546647792343
i am not up there i know but i have only just come down   11.063149921515333
do not allow it to escape   11.093021304428742
asked dantès who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm   8.25463486232202
oh shut up   8.109144972721253
for don t you see renée the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale   12.724928860993455
d artagnan obeyed   12.012316204455747
we had done the business of both admiring the foresight of our poor father who had taken the precaution to bring each of us up in a different religion   4.758420474226936
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal   8.513254482177722
upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo   14.802718876401334
ah   19.291248407393837
mordaunt reappeared   10.506009759896466
nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos   9.929453998546277
for until now no man has found himself in a position similar to mine   13.738656285213947
for one second d artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword   10.44997134661827
danglars   10.08028772597616
valentine had not seen him   6.528294083084285
perhaps said anne   10.763328631600299
do not fear   0.7464965787712394
the count stopped on seeing the young man   11.571987122352718
there was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which d artagnan bowed as a sign that he listened   19.769719601602596
what is there more   14.26816882647101
and she followed her husband upstairs   5.991121892043647
said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat   16.269330721279584
what can i do for you valentine   19.86041820317042
yes yes   12.943637347184787
then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution   12.376192645294557
we have them ready made   23.038127821794845
but continued m   11.917967401535035
but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years cocles did not recognize the count   8.777214980147422
then turning to monte cristo i hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she   11.103870889866254
but how shall we be happy   10.126250950206607
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes   11.963427741976705
nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy i beg of you   18.357011425975056
he is writing she said   18.38201996990741
never mind   6.301677740613829
i obey my captain s orders   8.882782875289378
it was almost broad daylight   10.377968225562347
not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his food to him   7.796718648369928
whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident monsieur bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed   10.131836331286506
cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning   7.877305599504938
she has fainted   20.686192955452583
have you a carriage   16.481117306719526
useless   13.775540900078793
well don t be inactive   14.740039030081203
our host has a well furnished cellar the key of which never leaves him   12.857574850600686
he is a miser   13.631729763347877
he asked again   5.162639538543292
colonel pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck that blow   15.256211157445478
cried valentine   16.716279863307815
bonacieux expected to see milady but she did not return   17.345263132167926
but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost senseless   11.287165787102012
40260m i will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid   19.048863442368614
the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day   17.185879817436916
he tried to follow monte cristo   22.27628480842319
no embellishments no embroidery no arabesques   20.20077992536443
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king   10.423051607679445
alas   11.06927747391267
and what is that   9.726770238786287
certainly   15.117321650387677
oh my legs my poor legs   8.645425844117792
come added the king   13.340672021051445
i think i can assist your researches said maximilian   15.092113606187528
in a few days you will be away from this place   17.49034072078501
sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact   7.380009217041935
i have answered you a hundred times fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me again   20.13543889379643
thought i that looks like my handiwork   13.476794332583015
oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face   15.58849961013324
planchet had no need to learn more   10.15492905023357
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject   13.06720658482747
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes   9.278005948938002
a little   22.58050604269892
i heard it from friquet   10.476039499527953
she should certainly return from her exile she did not doubt that a single instant   8.92959684168396
give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal   15.15288047145469
exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbé busoni   7.601626734175551
when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you   3.4606069683379523
athos began to despair   11.18719467384705
it was evident that there was clamor and sedition   11.078890693922926
but if anyone should come here the young girl shook her head   17.721946941963097
in france   7.631234186983411
well   11.847728901819728
which they deserve do they not   9.487475617313395
the queen is my enemy but is not yours sire   10.481180268467684
certainly not exclaimed mazarin   10.258539431138475
and his name   6.041300443172527
d avrigny and antoinette his niece   1.7138869878770038
doubtless i may but but   12.145881808513476
have you anything particular against him   13.34117912384736
where is he then   3.0272321613975013
this is capital   12.220444935533024
oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me   9.769298965432405
i think a little exertion would do me good   10.059095166374984
i am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that i wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory   17.663289244461193
i shall abide by that rule   17.73301707039607
he will spoil the feast   5.981812662422927
this jealous anger of milady was his revenge   19.36604928170086
my god my god my god   7.42382371651912
dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him   10.339679707264615
said d artagnan seizing his own   17.12795383050856
he was carried home in the arms of the people   13.011292272215549
and then there are robbers said la carconte   9.83175844952849
d artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details   5.829085942214135
and now in what direction did they set out   6.523392073950083
dantès had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirty six pound shot tied to his feet   12.122530019522202
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again   7.300762298680735
d artagnan bowed and thought both at the same hour   10.99512128563261
my good fellow said château renaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly   10.625706238228966
when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font madame de longueville contended no longer except as is the custom with pretty women to contend and defended herself only to surrender at last   7.53058010189997
ah indeed   17.212434358804888
then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to d artagnan take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey   9.742461897792772
he was yielding to your infernal influence   14.857105202886578
at the end of the piece étienne entered and announced to eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits   14.691770396550337
she rather feared that her preceding operations in england might have been discovered   15.625496223260766
eugénie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the count of monte cristo   7.7809937935802385
you are surprised at what you see here   19.133118716347422
and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service   9.844030085515426
i arose trembling   10.741907678142594
that evening continued bertuccio i could have killed the procureur but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken   10.694860042044981
7 prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no   14.547170566470907
now if i die say to d artagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me   16.005527922821443
what ho   11.687445908319074
besides it came into the young man s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair   18.16337012260645
he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape   13.431188568989903
adieu dear captain said porthos i shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony   10.856881654380093
where the devil then is he   15.29494887913439
child   9.286002381925286
but he is betrothed to your daughter i believe   9.293607294828794
ah me   6.767918001170386
he is in vendome where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris   18.056624736082092
he will not return till after the taking of the city   16.38050767088254
are you not a christian   7.058364602256169
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door   18.24269128850161
the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination   15.197756572273393
then your duchess is still at the waters   13.902629834478713
then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret   11.927443341106992
madame said the young man bowing   9.36906677766656
a child   11.816393943778149
one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event   20.537631656372184
sire said blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me   11.999891038920108
four o clock   13.674664293879141
try porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows   15.317382529902574
this personage was m   11.860410847690847
and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian   15.563884689039664
you are very fortunate said athos rising   9.326450267114451
shall you have time   9.297165930890612
denis   9.147061008019964
that cursed man my evil genius whom i have always met with when threatened by some misfortune he who accompanied that horrible woman when i met her for the first time he whom i was seeking when i offended our athos he whom i saw on the very morning madame bonacieux was abducted   11.617902685700926
for you have here at least three men who will not betray you   12.587871933342651
excuse me   8.184533423391688
as i went away a purse fell at my feet it contained five and twenty louis   8.92897062684786
when sir i tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish can you reply that i am wrong can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence   6.874897830240272
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down   8.826440608925838
it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts   8.36504649947057
yes and i take your brother with me   12.854842802434183
de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort   9.600960996750661
come monsieur bazin make yourself easy said d artagnan   21.310954259768735
the pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knows well they feast on the vulture   15.666045568686538
and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me   14.569974712873899
there she must always be   11.30030770205804
what is it   11.681434007489424
and she leaned against the window   10.650346888323332
de morcerf came he would find m   9.582858256412628
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness   10.956072443160755
for my part i confess to you that i was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the mazarins in the world   7.331792776340629
exactly so   14.42181726205702
it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair   11.889249995354072
humanity in a battle   15.059248825125568
ah yes the hashish is beginning its work   10.192890512158584
mousqueton   12.264228768672567
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river   9.137776430488971
i implored heaven that he might come   13.887591450619569
it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl s mind as to the reality of the scene   17.491095547770172
you wrong me my boy   14.842104578868762
designs by decamp as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa but more poetic   17.046869876312996
but look   13.419492642279561
the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pierrefonds to which porthos escorted his friend   10.564896570714362
the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide   14.635278091314966
i followed her i caught her i bound her   8.867463173186367
grimaud would have cried out   9.745417726238443
he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to you   16.004646450976516
he inquired   13.116345889647958
tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it   9.479782227378683
his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age   11.603528973867157
why did you not say so at once my dear sir   11.397968763196882
yes sir replied the coachman   17.432952022090163
but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market place with stones and halberds   18.911261823311715
no be assured i am not mad   16.615563444185277
what is going on   14.16307801691434
but in spite of albert s hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants   20.559292758492663
d artagnan breathed again   10.377690425001289
one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house   11.574983329663686
at length a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely master her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single tear   10.328945961003305
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued   12.571808887573116
chapter 47   8.09476171889321
as d artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m   16.885665895849588
the jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a man   5.283239572890297
de la trémouille but i warn you that i am well informed and all the fault is with your musketeers   6.753906825855578
go on go on   12.797213966070796
and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage   8.484334580359105
yes that is the very boy   13.79239531188548
yes you are right   20.506065046913655
again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages   13.417562601647074
the praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the baron s countenance would not have led him to suspect it   12.658882166749036
stop a moment cried d artagnan   11.015552170938495
a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were fire on that bench   11.40212172962445
only imagine but do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no   17.884173063241054
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire   10.945249538146475
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand   15.508756300944135
morrel extended his hand   9.934250646424843
he decided then to tell all   14.184907499117072
the figure put the comb in its pocket   8.131496876345683
i had but one thought and that was that he was observing me   4.614458843553624
oh if you refuse my advice what do you advise   7.907145471838246
murmured he i have so earnestly prayed to you that i hoped my prayers had been heard   10.743321033438843
but nothing escaped the count s notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister s secretary   13.340874055171415
and why so   20.330488482760494
and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him   9.170667591756615
chapter 33   11.09743587736152
what have been the results of your quarrel   15.327211356787739
charles bowed and retired   12.714392691137416
indeed   11.910558988604537
what matters this punishment as long as he is avenged   10.763781101482033
i do not want you   15.554595171145333
then they embraced   13.810670688164556
he received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the parliament of bretagne   14.211118483270194
or fifteen   4.182075460546223
danglars   14.78699351710233
at the first announcement of peace madame de chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities   9.81829680344015
said porthos a little perplexed between the two i suppose as i came with you i must go away with you   12.406939354793392
de villefort   15.72750219127236
do you know that monsieur   4.136702840588585
ah ah   8.617237490077615
27 said the inspector   13.859620333450666
i wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody   15.00576804910348
yes go   9.315019917032677
and why pray master la ramee   13.545695404937533
but what do you advise then   15.16371881162
good night my friends   17.307506624440492
cried d artagnan making the best face possible and never retreating one step before his three assailants who continued to shower blows upon him   16.7762476395305
and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert s side   5.831713639807778
taste some of this ham d artagnan   13.140759270238663
then these 1 000 francs said mercédès shuddering   16.51334445184594
let us dispatch said the duke   11.27564862869937
have you kept him in the cellar all this time   12.826419806911328
in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal   10.49881825917187
edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him   12.734240015276374
perhaps you are right said morcerf   12.42559041310356
he is in masquerade   17.826081108176453
d artagnan   11.675485468775827
but what have you done   16.779576647805744
i find england a charming country and i stay but on one condition only   16.08702187061524
require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness   7.8208371501192
but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied athos   7.80113374387182
and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it   7.375594188165689
today is the 5th of june   15.031840548347194
as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and renée in waiting   9.859860481004388
said the inspector   14.238768840926342
this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien with a pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox   9.04308037351407
why how fast you go on father dantès   12.151861451223915
exclaimed la carconte   14.246163814159921
but said albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel   11.541081674369163
albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by beauchamp found himself in the banker s study   11.945625140229847
in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations   11.284132822281897
at his announcement d artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his bones   7.9200716902959245
do you not know him   17.29677024941921
and his scotch guard to louis xi   15.683455158166876
and now i am convinced said d artagnan that this abduction of the queen s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris   14.2708733218373
this with my spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month   14.191852539918466
cried the abbé   12.456952476070198
for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse   11.21238300857701
and then my lord continued rochefort you understand that to emerge from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change one s prison   12.095172850789162
asked the king in a severe tone   11.262123249406903
and you you would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis   3.0736296194745627
they knew all they wished to know   17.745795888692378
he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow   10.685765202153892
how do you take it   13.504030369722615
no indeed   7.387941266162623
yes that was it said d artagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue eyes   15.811904005526154
what would you   8.896357930284736
i too could have a tilbury   19.846630706837946
chapter xvii   10.826776908872635
my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me   13.836545396106951
here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile   15.274921347120767
yes   10.58190679492693
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction   12.629817324092672
while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia   11.35757250313129
but i do not wish anyone to stay with me   10.926218313533106
do you call him nebuchadnezzar   7.039311372543547
the magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles   15.423237428088289
shall i take any arms   15.845586409017553
replied caderousse   13.80851614930908
excellent   8.534831656507922
as franz was about to take leave of m   13.206033888510474
but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman   14.041336132323025
holloa monsieur d artagnan   15.058520543856352
i have not been earnest enough   17.617983660296712
it doesn t surprise me said d artagnan in a low tone to porthos that mazarin would have been much better satisfied had i crushed the life out of his councillor   15.679505806567612
you got in very well   19.84489130202847
because i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it   13.847415084089118
six days ago i landed at portsmouth   8.600140839351733
it was useless to search at night and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning   10.05939436815684
armed to the teeth   9.556919328787775
here i am dear count   7.901018607719201
in fact tears rolled down his cheeks   12.836525143440955
yes doubtless   14.468930843635711
and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea   8.528257073936471
but have the kindness to give the abbé busoni i told you he was not at home repeated the valet   10.669432822037145
i believed that madame loved him   9.360285577417578
on what plea   17.22370611167358
said d artagnan who began to understand   8.178074115292336
air liberty melody of birds plains of lombardy venetian canals roman palaces the bay of naples   7.153605295686749
it is the will of god   3.486584265819694
well then said dantès what shall you teach me first   17.137242007871357
i know that i ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if i do i shall learn nothing further   9.616401282526784
you speak as though you had loved this young dantès observed the abbé without taking any notice of his companion s vehemence   13.649267250450011
she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again   15.784406016852149
robert le diable chapter 54   13.798313285126024
monte cristo shuddered and arose   15.558239438545264
the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again   12.266763150717484
these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain   15.041636884388655
the chancellor entered half smiling half blushing   19.841437483142407
he is alone   12.441606163405183
asked monte cristo   19.293664335041388
the king and the cardinal are the best of friends   20.48402264806047
said athos   4.877343229530971
it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom   18.66780237383498
his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads   12.135399374942429
and he let his head sink upon his hands while two large tears rolled down his cheeks   18.796242353638213
i would give as much as a hundred pistoles   9.362120948502078
they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known   11.205181921636772
it is true that since i left him i seem to have lost my senses   9.398153613084256
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen what is this madame   9.982271754684481
we shall require no arms   4.707086267735764
soon as kitty left him d artagnan directed his steps toward the rue férou   16.48042796571096
we let them tell their story out replied mousqueton   16.769352744126255
the same perhaps said he   5.990419816949545
danglars trembled too   16.904740377604625
that can only be to hold gloves he said   14.908231187486214
he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him   15.504287195985613
but andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent   8.16339185812738
i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror   13.732278977816385
you are punctual said he as he drew back the door   13.748638898086332
i do not madame rejoined mazarin   8.85157733674827
bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house and in the foreground instead of the usual paving stones half hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that morning laid down and upon which the water was yet glistening   11.402523629981173
and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it   7.46666762327428
consider well what you do in that house   11.546262510366644
besides although the ballet was danced the evening had scarcely begun   12.605511317321598
we have nothing to fear from those who love us   2.7355412070287812
m   9.659879283080445
hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal   16.195580210035136
the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep   18.22065731515293
and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account   25.45818051306128
can i believe my ears   18.76530625248585
at notre dame   6.6087971363744495
next milady whose secret i have discovered   16.05169987792668
yes   7.867417693239542
maillard   14.317647260709666
the young officer preserved silence   5.429737166691346
said raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellow s life to thank you on my own account   14.17474972974298
as soon as you feel able to swim we will go   12.9829187063571
hold just above that tree is the little spot where i thought i was killed   12.824072670716342
the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said i signori francesi   8.141847149914593
yes for it is like one   9.16317035626218
you have either been working for me or thinking of me   11.550896131172786
planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier and d artagnan toward the rue férou   13.091129797523871
patience patience   8.07815489245687
m   17.624942959011733
the fact is hazarded d artagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis   15.626672146384621
vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone   13.62136940305678
you think then as i do that she deceives me   18.688496218752782
he was wealthy once perhaps   7.5136949372079815
this poor child is quite resigned as she knows she can not live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger   13.572232867929452
the queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice   15.23390086114123
in my house murmured he in my house   10.345741245591544
cried barrois who felt another fit coming   19.131336758049244
both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope   12.169199548153925
well then i will tell you what we must do   15.16315272594886
i shall fight heart and soul for mazarin   12.121574771442653
de winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of emotion   14.991225256283602
they exchanged bows and d artagnan returned to his companions   14.808763996941998
the major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm manner at the same time casting his eyes down either to give himself time to compose his countenance or to assist his imagination all the while giving an under look at the count the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity   9.099920428920264
well said cucumetto have you executed your commission   21.789253963185686
have i sir comprehended your instructions   10.859180027796809
de tréville   16.078984666278924
with a word d artagnan reassured them   18.362023152125367
you have robbed you have assassinated   10.343177181553271
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea   10.609273224976917
she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune   8.084842596754777
cried he   10.310408452958017
no violence   11.172401814461658
what   9.200967108712318
cried milady   7.690425778913768
but the fleur de lis on her shoulder   10.777089141525625
so much the better   1.759586027200701
but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop   10.436524703205228
yes sir you shall see them   8.89033861353452
you will perceive that this may last a long time   9.322162812612532
but at daybreak he awoke   15.686171463661772
oh it is all my wife s fault   6.3133720387805
that s pretty positive continued d artagnan   16.455022551902946
strength and sagacity   9.052632416822775
well what is the matter   13.97309329905554
did you come from boulogne   3.2539216338770487
now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness   11.155500182248435
then in a suppressed tone as if speaking to himself this is annoying continued he   18.149952541723916
but asked madame danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent m   6.972445668162981
but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears   14.988820699234473
more than that we shall have a tempest or i don t know what s what   10.316941323146388
the chateau   15.592770756417055
ah don t be angry i beg of you that would be useless   5.55558197308742
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit   10.378388783741986
i will leave him at the place i quit and he will conduct you to me   10.387979253619756
after the pope s death and his son s exile it was supposed that the spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal s time   10.569463392069515

d avrigny i should kill myself   17.869807929004015
most certainly but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant this dear child and myself must both have perished   2.5182974426426785
during the day i had nothing to fear   4.459810335433392
i am sure of it   16.061822205310246
i am sure you would not have forced me to come   17.59709134563692
the rest of the dinner was to come   19.23639011212319
but when will that be   12.871938881792943
it seems to make one feverish and to raise one s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done   13.367890434424387
on reaching the palace d artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay   14.628859159674107
then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers   4.787176450631829
the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling costume   13.30530741402252
and who completed it as it now is   7.898489067698861
monsieur says i am coward cried olivain because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in grammont s regiment and i refused to accompany him   11.495112327323502
yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely   12.780317949088687
he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor   13.680819953310221
exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can   10.39463521448746
he recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all hearts   14.194386855788728
he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding   6.822627956433118
i will then release you from all your promises even that of procuring my admission into the musketeers   15.177864124169364
said the abbé turning towards dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass   14.966977243032723
said felton   15.632569661109109
nothing else was talked of   9.334257989185325
well then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied   13.123187956630325
indeed they are not   11.255878041685158
d artagnan returned to less important affairs and the three musketeers repaired to the king s quarters where they had to prepare their lodging   14.240746248093227
but all took up the cry in chorus down with mazarin   20.509442319590825
this man named emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he was superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated   13.401019197571753
but what are you doing   11.296071585757579
impossible   9.850356780397602
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same   9.555196514431236
yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting   16.828354411481005
i don t know him   6.282885432218261
how ought she really to be supremely loved   10.780593237231686
an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race   17.891532246844324
you see my poor friend that i am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness   12.124568758022551
said athos speaking in a low voice   13.460211398018384
i doubt it my lord   9.781376960587307
said mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about cromwell s person   12.097095146047797
you understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box   12.912685553383563
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see   9.807030184411982
go leave me   12.065856326714277
the monk s eyes glittered   3.2984731371998155
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself   15.249355174664823
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden   8.219299080097866
well if you are cold planchet you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder and be in waiting for me at the door by six o clock in the morning   7.348316470153009
he then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume   10.815758468148818
two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault   12.37525151139876
but you my poor child   14.433048405065799
yet you have something to tell me   4.98885399155908
you are crazy   13.655548699823896
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her   8.839029235012028
thanks for the comparison said albert with a bow   15.106962238460984
our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant   5.012532306218016
and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably not toward london where d artagnan and porthos believed they were going but to durham whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the tyne near newcastle   11.220571041782126
this excess of bilious humor could not be attributed to play   9.148840694018732
who has taken my piece of glass   11.675131220776912
cried milady   17.764824810437684
i think he did not for he fell without a cry   13.057778538966504
what a strange man you are   6.7914211893933825
listen then to the supplication of a despairing woman   9.852978061276225
and when will the dance begin   8.234269523301144
aramis found athos and brought him   16.33629735028498
when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade   8.742180569330223
i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body   11.622591252761161
instead of signing i will go to you and we will fly   16.78716028825989
then turning to d artagnan she said sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received   12.737891880010782
and slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court   7.158465267522046
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner s feverish imagination   22.352365416705773
oh i would fight for such a cause   7.543348593957594
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage   5.089541850224351
fortunately they have left me all i had   10.896126399218302
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it   12.949144172630968
listen said m   10.611625781013638
he was an athletic gigantic bandit with large eyes thick lips and a flat nose   19.48567033344655
yes   13.415316517777287
your majesty s mind may be quite at ease replied the officer   13.128281132847931
two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass through   10.610812028068294
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons   9.961161189893616
but traitors to england are no longer members of my family   10.292079132386387
whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows i am at her command   16.215441768471873

cæsar borgia who had completed his conquest had need of money to purchase all italy   7.116613285296233
the old man s eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection   8.557409269075366
my wife must have committed some frightful crime   12.99236011306896
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect   13.589354609312226
guiche knew everybody madame de neuillan mademoiselle d aubigne mademoiselle de scudery mademoiselle paulet madame de chevreuse   6.172065141989763
what a question   9.911750573378034
oh you love her still said kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young man s countenance for an instant   12.914239832491095
would you like to know how matters have progressed   12.006911568920271
two hours after all was over   11.705486243256814
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over   8.852060038115226
he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge   9.773584255523483
said d artagnan   6.748891138194202
and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time   10.70981122500876
your brother in law is a barrister   11.407156773602477
my dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account   9.406292590045442
you are insane monsieur   8.91618661559119
he entered the marshal s apartment while i was there   11.681907092405451
and the shore from the point of l aiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles roberges and feluccas   9.45373235001644
then the castle of saint angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won   12.828722288945848
and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame   12.340270561733593
they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and thirst   19.355614118119014
but the wall had been recently pointed and d artagnan could get no hold   20.160001481604837
tell me tell me tell me i say repeated milady how do you know it   10.323874571275615
the two men turned round and saw morrel standing at the door pale and terror stricken   11.972074627403604
there in the salon   16.056538961913418
porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall   6.563576826477869
as regards yourself the need of protection   17.159417365345288
and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him   18.333640866264346
oh mon dieu   16.712551644494518
i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty   12.281816150482475
he pointed his finger to the lighted window   17.071551994549807

then you have thought that barrois was poisoned   13.060636464779076
the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose   13.303268762677995
i have since learned that he was confined in the château d if and i should like to learn some particulars of his death   14.077773035881048

ah   6.899050994624459

the silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie madame said he at length i pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here   10.701321055814152
andrea cavalcanti   21.485790021656218
then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier   14.795914739817428

and the best proof of it is said d artagnan that he has dispatched us to meet the duc de vendome his father who is coming in his turn   9.51314850328482
monsieur le vicomte knows that i never joke   11.687439378916283
albert extended his hand   8.005535062610136

few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate   8.952400326669434
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence d artagnan went straight to the residence of athos   16.99441996786984
this horrible place contained fifty cells   12.815401836455305

they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared   7.814095271446581
by heavens   6.643977535863311
is yours   12.512173947465417
pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a rope dancer   13.607989500665546
his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht   9.607025939669965
here i am said he   10.360467503975816
morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes   9.372896411175969
now monsieur de vallon said mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country   12.196884625137043
1   5.292489181482137
no one has ever dared to give me any   17.322535967527074
that is no impediment sir said she   5.541861227930598
we are friends   10.390243818003272
jackson said he go instantly to the lord chancellor and tell him that i charge him with the execution of these orders   10.457263818296202
let us say no more on the subject   10.814939506314165
but but   7.530240987094357
andrea   17.387564583664666
my mother gave it to me and i fool as i was instead of keeping the ring as a holy relic gave it to this wretch   5.0909794031840665
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside   13.065100501720444
but he said the count s generosity is too overwhelming   10.201915189902943
and in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group   8.170181997955812
resumed porthos   7.913639746703255
she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor   16.52484490515687
i assure you i intend to play the devil s game to night   13.281222619092382
how so   14.393823101035776
de tréville entered bringing a sealed packet   16.52162732650818
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still   17.860144235780858
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber   18.337521568276962
said my enemy in a jeering tone that s quite another thing   18.959250820684854
thus the dealer to whom d artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his color   10.940114891239553
what do you say   3.276173427048562
they will not dare to refuse me then   13.345837727115857
number 3 has two staircases inside and outside   19.947965195780405
in the morning i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence   10.454548738017362
she must know nothing of the matter   9.476963735044404
ah monsieur said planchet i will succeed or i will consent to be cut in quarters   15.712730219992128
said monte cristo with charming artlessness   9.342437391113428
he recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard   14.564147136074462
a carriage was in waiting   8.563194464673936
they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people s misery   13.424550449781606
the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey   17.783143507523775
albert repeated danglars shrugging his shoulders   5.225914234706007
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also   13.989128451778596
said athos   10.10163049472495
said danglars   10.563459843899537
chapter xxii   9.809341607099459
monsieur d artagnan   15.666755817505237
laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time   11.013724771190933
0113m here is your chamber for tonight said he   14.949803700892566
said the inspector   13.636005896566653
like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse   11.14432914747777
oh i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise   13.088151278786631
is in fact unlimited said monte cristo   7.268544793979701
you say she is only a slave   20.273933353145207
your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air   12.873845084123086
and this time at any rate valentine will not die   10.85845532321511
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty   10.576607463861098
if you know a prayer say it for you are condemned and you shall die   19.488039053964386
pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs   12.182662132918361
madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees   13.610185298369215
yes said caderousse   10.550784945642055
i think so   13.478709104017625
inquired danglars visibly agitated   13.00868032880692
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur   8.074750180551245
and where i pray you   11.889614655326866
if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor   16.38375654025979
and what was he saying   12.141008776094989
i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden   14.797427420799284
certainly my dear sir   12.830205755872473
do you know his house at auteuil   14.2154595995288
this mass of rock like the giant adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow   13.23449325473178
at daybreak i left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion asleep   7.319424218889697
why   11.099187304081573
but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart   6.561663019434702
la ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner   9.623140505568404
let us go to the peacock   14.376053417695402
go d artagnan go   1.8131361289710934
how much is it worth   12.608497363806363
never had flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure   2.6484959906879055
i learn all in the silence of my apartments for instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music   9.873483800216333
if you are young i will be your comrade   10.199143842086526
murmured d artagnan   7.09306453237705
and for pirates   11.631757934303957
it is a charming place well supplied with spring water and fine trees   10.41857396705466
d artagnan alone was calm at least in appearance   10.878448449127823
it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes his refusal by winking them several times and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven   9.952018261799358
a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to m   9.329918703218434
come collect yourself and tell me all   14.730289386372018
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night   9.569416318266622
take planchet   5.570419992510053
0173m will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell   13.751872539532872
he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on l impartial the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor   17.243890748145862
i have no right to it   11.457722886953817
that will do said milady   7.711020096134655
and as i am not a millionaire like the gentleman in the next apartments said franz i warn you that as i have been four times before at rome i know the prices of all the carriages   15.480371965754435
with your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that i dreamed that i was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so   22.10365799987519
gutenberg   13.615761367955882
d artagnan owned nothing   13.681566111309253
do you know in what crime you are to day engaged   17.03916934569621
my brother continued she was not that my lord buckingham whom i saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived   18.291869122423563
but it can not be   11.638458778443573
i say it is easy enough answered porthos   11.44620573060182
then advancing to the president s desk what is the form said he   8.955082352881227
impossible   15.92455931063772
but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend   18.05891523980065
another souvenir of monsieur mordaunt   10.185255855237914
d artagnan sire   13.935063293260257
the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work   16.18714389518844
said the young man   13.80257851016158
silence and go the same way you came   10.233416765892748
the valet left the room   5.620782314600356
i have not time for anybody s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests   10.599443547071521
that was d artagnan s road as he was going to the louvre   10.038233761385843
ah   18.221123534518007
de saint méran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship   21.127367226057224
we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos   16.720999910100645
yes   14.585531824132305
yes ruined   7.516083371399421
so much the better   4.988808480218722
toward two o clock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door   14.094109651193877
and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols   11.893387102813419
twice he was obliged to step back   11.756953957286164
on wheels dear friend   7.4386151034654615
said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in darkness   11.635540733871599
and here is mr   10.916357252855734
only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saint méran insist that m   8.436851928883925
asked porthos   17.431916760034696
and aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window   20.413204500724976
planchet turned and returned the billet   7.1274861637533515
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative   4.503737080318247
the stranger smiled a melancholy smile   7.761614732294303
where is the count friend   14.43309754573802
and a jailer is no man to a prisoner he is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron   18.40124816892444
i mean on my left yes there   10.601534358832463
penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his captain   13.570465247555127
monte cristo shuddered   11.54222833720995
for it was very old and dull too   6.261414264169688
alas   18.83737707233125
the count took out his watch   11.746587991531014
never   11.827267719658796
madame coquenard i gave you the preference   12.188500076652728
she stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen why then do you always weep mother when i am away from you   13.197832020682474
her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her   13.861114245406187
and you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes   10.80135213747599
bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person of the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal to whom he transmitted the messenger s words   8.160709985955773
after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening   20.29164923737072
d artagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of a court could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception   9.277183933882906
well   3.3007530195759056
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him   13.15973697228248
milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart   6.066561381682275
in beauty or on the contrary   7.0870872505820595
bravery is always respected even in an enemy   12.215297300039607
the dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother   11.616812610625475
i come to bring and to hear bad tidings   20.24456331260921
what new gibberish is that   7.168505018564057
d artagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read dec   12.736562378913103
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence   8.725676848243019
monsieur pailletin if you please my good woman replied andrea   13.402920774845366
porthos said aramis athos has already told you that you are a simpleton and i am quite of his opinion   8.765163769014967
you will be deceived just the same said athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in question   19.81853799748523
all i can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season   12.007710813463131
he has lost five ships in two years has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses and his only hope now is in that very pharaon which poor dantès commanded and which is expected from the indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo   13.38377982503564
he made fruitless efforts to go on   8.090991995813608
milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat   8.977489540144925
gentlemen we are arrived   8.092820082587078
culpable at the most of weakness how cruelly punished by his subjects   14.142621843347019
yes   15.32386449325107
nevertheless i confess i still doubt   9.582131373745105
the queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be repaired   10.484020664908835
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the count s safety became now quite a secondary matter   13.351128979252591
said she   11.837790648593511
albert said the journalist these are questions which it is difficult to answer   9.755226746447454
she advanced some steps towards the staircase and listened   10.547115889377006
do you prefer i should seek m   9.134076430741393
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty   15.073531539846561
and knows lansquenet   11.980772139560587

c   14.304231222114572
lord de winter died without revealing anything to his brother   13.895756147967669
what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures   20.869471697624377
de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother   6.320863468509969
the comte de la fere   16.214026104592094
i have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire   19.370051698091427
cried i   18.650861457157266
i must sleep at beaucaire   9.428184434961619
was the woman handsome   12.344628270848006
you insist on my contradicting the article relating to general fernand an article with which i assure you on my word of honor i had nothing whatever to do   10.750563490523538
that will console him   15.500915548941755
we will lay your case before the commandant of the post   8.47108554129274
asked the cardinal   6.6057599069460435
yes but he couldn t understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return   12.435400325125899
how did you fare   9.003176424818479
you madame have only sought to increase your own and i am convinced that you have succeeded   7.973375303513609
what rival   17.98201655897035
indeed i feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a first rate paris tailor probably blin or humann   12.115568630942287
the king entertained great regard for my father who had fallen at the siege of arras and the uniform was granted   13.23172468140232
noirtier made a sign that she was to do so   9.583599325217921
then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon   7.69758758196765
s   20.792050473614104
the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea they perceived a large white sail   20.234934968512334
the duke however was not dead   9.159989464135084
rochefort s lackey would precede it as courier   15.797169546706051
it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer   8.536974498789062
and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life   17.004700722717633
yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves   13.22887651077166
the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators   12.399297829645297
he will have had the glory of having saved his king cried winter   11.177888873007479

valentine the night light continued to burn on the chimney piece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water   13.052950710594791
cried blaisois   14.245265109872307
he struck his forehead on the ground and groaned   12.32719281839271
this is a detail preserved to us by brienne   10.10975141898071
will that do   8.949797415084648

danglars speculates whereas he never does   2.4697140548083123
the greatest my dear bonacieux   13.368500146289584
you have been served as you desire monsieur for you were warned just now and i now again warn you   16.51864692577175
what for five years he had been wanting a faithful servant a friend a helping hand seemed to have fallen from heaven just when he expected it the least   15.90474498694165
all must depend on circumstances   8.66455572617581
latterly i heard his friend monsieur d artagnan give him that name   9.134724071003493
no no do not be deceived   18.13126828429241
and before dantès could open his mouth before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoner s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon   11.234717652509572
the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of valentine   14.236053732911795

no   12.712392095708674
he whose intellect was thus supreme raoul was the actual sovereign   16.064686823149113
oh by the way you d better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the chat qui pelote   10.462946807029207
meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors increased   1.2192695881067088
asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver   18.655617651773035
i willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon me   12.59957547906344
said villefort   20.271176343900898
i was going to say that i received a letter almost to the same effect   9.632971060718287
it is the devil in person   5.870248902380871
and bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returning that will reduce the sum to five thousand livres   10.991221231261742
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said   16.307345700708275
one hundred thousand francs repeated peppino   9.972746965413853
morrel that s the whole truth on the honor of a sailor   0.17537590193268393
and at this word the smile on the cardinal s lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable   13.017511181680126
willingly   10.795162962417793
time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses   7.631149562740806
it is true   12.715193553930849
he saw valentine and his eye brightened   4.422714828016046
oh yes it is you indeed   5.763120862187018
that thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friends from m   11.506741508454583
and we porthos said d artagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal   16.73504553668294
he uttered and reflected for a moment   17.300768200583164
a second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling help murder   8.011640151436072
you will be very kind to me will you not morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus   19.084525831235215
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse   10.740887405372698
pray let me know who you really are   12.503897784604465
the good george   27.236091283569436
but what can i do for you   16.24627183462648

that is a minister who will hold office for six months   14.760733105204961
what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame de villefort   10.783432279410565
he left the saucepan   11.39305959787846
mademoiselle danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor   5.924150474140409
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips   13.123322880252747
they would hate us both less   12.890256301891746
this way this way my dear albert   16.26765934214882
i   16.63597056292067
which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes   11.516612873821348
a presentation   10.868268918925319
i had ennui and i amused myself with twisting that rope   10.00149416703554
then said the count i am emboldened to speak openly to you   18.475780497566326
did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named dantès   10.511565330648054
and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion   8.95635222254738
after a moment s interval cocles appeared   11.165003063905788
you here at this hour   13.015316333306096
yes   13.90687153553462
how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i don t know myself   9.777636043317305
really yes said the coadjutor i have heard this affair mentioned   15.101758589973606
noirtier fixed his eyes on her   14.555309065644357
laporte give the light to monsieur the chevalier de coislin   13.243284912357145

he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united   11.711711654588798
at length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their ears   11.488180825133904
forward   12.181530567781952
you were right sir said anne   20.671296423727163
de morcerf was so proud   25.896677218323518
yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief   12.65542515098342
d artagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past eight   14.661378587221373
one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades   11.122120253798576
nine days after leaving the charente pale with fatigue and vexation milady saw only the blue coasts of finisterre appear   11.48766732459498
it was the abode of the little abbé scarron   4.803998482988627
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her self possession which she had never lost   14.194630266036883
i have plenty of time and it will be more correct   9.579650879337226
murmured athos   19.358354682348825
well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something   16.531069490923453
come come sleepy head   8.861836567677143

coquenard is going to the house of the duc de chaulnes who has sent for him   8.550147267715385
swear first on your honor not to inform him of our return   13.75080188329317

i say monsieur that chance has rendered me master of a secret which you will guard i hope young man as your life   17.914508494037626
cocles remained in m   11.26923083619052
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white bellied black clawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him   10.749884212928967
as he spoke the abbé took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to caderousse said here my friend take this diamond it is yours   17.46303823176453
the young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted   13.319056613444157
let us to bed   15.807995119840758
i forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen   11.433378750261458
i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of second rate fortunes   16.330939944402804
they are compounded doubly strong   11.804243446094715
ah my poor friend   12.697272812800026
who told you that i had been weeping   11.096461056023113

with the frenchman the man who had followed him entered too   7.225210957830767
and now in her turn let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade but my debt   8.602565468760684
stuart begged this favor and harrison consented   14.97450169986179
you have indeed a noble nature edmond and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment   14.192508339820094
what man   15.624970996298508
well yes replied raoul   13.963636860364497
yes   14.676297628123926
they seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies   10.775373103507732
as i had expected i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand marshal   10.446723898006605
nonsense said d artagnan   16.415722670675812
and if you please by the corso   6.389452421721968
there remained athos and d artagnan   15.659502441380138
just think   17.87336501583165
well monsieur de montbazon is the husband of madame de montbazon and and madame de montbazon is the mistress of the duc de beaufort   14.626573337936499
first i was a forger answered andrea as calmly as possible   12.57609335994404
it was your excellency   6.782278282456948
what   7.07046463646272
but at this moment two shots were fired   4.233789016628497
grimaud   7.232627609679635
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came re entered the hôtel and went to his apartment   19.759636911214695
d épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible   11.575190668206186
what need you fear   18.866985210095063
asked athos   7.486967218803312
the citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime   12.610918817778296
d artagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a mazarinist   8.662256922076486
well my dear sir said danglars to fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy   15.487081374224884
the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines   14.543365152287983
monte cristo smiled   10.276240621154532
all hands to the pumps   16.664987972645747
do you wish for a name   15.872796587723151
said mazarin astonished   13.627375861228975
yes i will reduce this rebellious city to ashes   9.397431245822519
are we softened a little   17.929529978677397
i shall pass over them   14.71676695455375
do not these circumstances appeal to your memory   12.812832317548809
ah   12.382757725925279
the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive   15.239527193363484
what   19.026042349082736
what do you mean   14.284670955217944
here they are and 200 more besides   6.116554075943911
inquired raoul   12.076214037518554
exclaimed mercédès if it were so if i possessed free will but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair   17.204988431877883
once pale he was now yellow   14.84221960619443
both got into albert s coupé   19.456802360089945
but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed   18.434834578150618
albert sprang out bearing his moccoletto in his hand   15.647204737291162
are you sure of what you assert   8.93089764349677
the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since i saw you madame bonacieux and i should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks   10.86406530956743
the minister of police giving way to an impulse of despair was about to throw himself at the feet of louis xviii   14.303195000328664
inquired dantès   12.862707589526547
villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary   9.284122845179724
then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyone s mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness   7.281466151641144
seven o clock in the morning   13.105544221491904
i really must ask you to excuse me m   13.33778814880203
he cried   10.948602286044114
asked athos   15.041782232847703
you   9.3112523904443
they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose   17.10445842730945
mme   11.960340180262744
at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges dantès who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head   14.154054463741797
the beggar of st   21.072687692323328
demanded she of milady   13.032495076828871
it is nothing   14.408998978654513
she cried   7.084212066415136
but what has this vision of henry iv   12.62417740098035
the comte de la fere can not be far off only the doors are locked   16.295012062419495
upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie   12.53895627207456
name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my friends   10.342031988093154
monsieur de scudery the author of clelie and of le grand cyrus which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister who is now talking to that pretty person yonder near monsieur scarron   14.25803900545561
and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew   3.3308248139168075
the jewel is yours my dear athos   6.913218811217501
i will offer myself as floor polisher   16.416457712610946
said the young woman supplicating him and clasping her hands together monsieur in the name of heaven by the honor of a soldier by the courtesy of a gentleman depart   4.559746746350863
i know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore i in my turn will be serviceable to you   12.135083389670184
no no be easy on that score   15.320157555161504
bertuccio bowed and resumed his story   8.496843855542645
the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young lady s diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly   20.047956719187653
d artagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and listened   15.0530154619136
tell me why does a steward rob his master   9.739956658016537
a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed   17.317111486666427
he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray   14.860498961743916
he likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little mme   8.663795330044778
he has come   15.925921892478335
ah   7.194701679947528
no my guardian replied raoul blushing   12.166817522593247
denis   15.537010902453959
it had not been used   22.293122445063183
exclaimed felton on seeing the knife glitter in her hand   16.546418120904043
i should like to say something evil of mazarin   14.634729492423775
come count you do not do that young man justice   13.564505272897696
but beware if you and your musketeers are guilty   17.00773770086553
36 rue de la victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted louise   9.78302843995925
he said   12.248313112022714
he was waiting first for juxon then for martyrdom   13.579285658166434
the following day about three o clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count   16.174086003759978
not another step he said or you are a dead man   15.34768073128044
one would think it had been placed here on purpose   16.956406558420653
and then the past will no longer exist   11.695489972134745
at last he sank   14.991893069747759
well he shall live   8.702813126817752
i shall be delighted to have your opinion   9.813956197651086
porthos was the first to speak   11.076801181446656
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter   8.507112978555249
speech failed her   14.009411728164897
fernand became deadly pale   12.62978358225148
and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt   14.93029132130211
the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the parade he had already three inches of steel in his breast   8.98357162120075
yes was the reply in a low voice   11.985627790057691
go away from here and leave the place to us   8.935991084558296
asked franz of the count   13.74021727192105
i heard your voice up to the last moment   14.863409219889167
yes repeated the leader in a whisper god bless his majesty   21.929920177445503
de villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them   5.034054412474775
de villefort entered followed by barrois   10.898989558225546
on my word said albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge   3.82160504781263
go go at once   11.82827995952983
asked benedetto with his most ingratiating smile   14.834139054425709
he was alone again   16.671228279861378
but after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him   7.620348191700149
they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen   11.365369259710906
he seized the inspector s hand   16.63011101557243
he remembered that morcerf had been taxed at 4 000 crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than morcerf he fixed his own price at 8 000 crowns   18.091020841061436
and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter   2.6315958566782616
i can boast with truth of being an honest man   19.62802180460185
yes   8.930917995259538
so it was with monsieur d artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel   11.687865641291626
meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread   5.048177439969981
come what did she say   15.450311104112025
said he   19.336974010036162
never mind   17.024814754821534
really i do not know what i have been thinking of i have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour   11.346023001483347
morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten   11.61777166412221
then there was the ring with the lion s head which cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand   2.1148577395706205
asked d artagnan uneasily   11.784120651616362
get down then and quickly   15.27040550391889
now see here will that be all   11.78321225398254
that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and re counted is odious to me   18.190951253052763
what was most pressing was to get mme   16.699075000387257
danglars said   14.064142049486154
he opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him   17.114587309703865
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear   9.445946724199564
but the means the means   9.933297181173055
that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man smiling   7.168311970199378
is it my fortune which you find insufficient   11.979428977225444
but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of   8.597672921420273
here is monsieur comminges said d artagnan returning to the cardinal   10.57219107152798
we will wait then said morrel   11.820137161126759

from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchen garden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market gardeners at a yearly rental of 500 francs   15.382241847119781
de morcerf approached her   7.96516564851485

i wish to speak with him this evening   21.41637521990981

the coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by athos raoul and aramis   15.92485289520314
ah maximilian i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend   15.672664947574681
let us talk of something else if you please   11.91039831191694

d épinay   12.270127756739344
certainly   8.79100011995249
exclaimed the abbé   13.335907209320812
he could say no more   4.147242950671796
for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for something   12.899415874962768
my faith it appears so   9.944148202410076
they exclaimed as all rose in bewilderment   17.296874079550783

and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself   8.858159082485587
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule d artagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain l auxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy   10.643334571445338

well said caderousse why don t you come   12.242819610359186
said danglars   8.342029929571796
they will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them   14.221026955304643

his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercédès exercised over him   18.287570901437206
i was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner   5.630577392214632
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted   12.141763349751901
he trembled all over   5.817637339213867
with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details   14.197378523899355

d artagnan rose and taking a letter from his writing desk presented it to raoul   10.393900345566836
i became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences   15.69864011040313
ah yes   9.020720592770903
d artagnan then returning to the officer said sir have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say tis by his eminence s order and that i shall await him at the stables   17.778920230686076
very well   13.967465436872207

they are these   8.519764474172154
i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey me   14.405430715347666

monte cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep   12.22237598907222
cried d artagnan   5.773064309047497
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved   7.205582532896784
before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward   12.899509092357206
our young friend will be extremely well received   16.025978725732685
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me   5.369716030567855
who could ever have believed it   11.986012514204788
well no not very   11.985326188558945
do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmond s misfortunes   14.50626931255841
and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away   12.295113216092107
egad   13.066055699306517
nevertheless it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and frank   12.321784486800096
danglars conceals at least half of his fortune   14.46250301117394
embrace me my son   13.91112154905283
the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand   12.1437870047505
is it possible exclaimed the count with well feigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness   14.107018641424842
m   14.246354025496125
you are then going to a hotel that will be very dull for you   8.7015246839455
this chamber was a sort of garret situated in the rue des fossoyeurs near the luxembourg   13.909194379947431
try me gentlemen said he and i swear to you by my honor that i will not go hence if we are conquered   19.08615216369168
every time i see you is a fresh diamond which i enclose in the casket of my heart   10.789990231854087
look out   6.9312888360503155
napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans   14.251117096846734
who can tell   14.258156487859438
simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which i stand was to let i made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of this fine crop of lucern   18.653377071540174
yes almost said aramis   20.808098137012976
i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris   2.8283449921680255
who has consoled me in my sorrow but he   16.654359297918546
oh   13.057376006950252
he approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall all is useless said he he is dead   20.34969588784248
although i had not seen villefort s face i recognized him by the beating of my heart   17.61188325728282
ah   17.37901183782636
to the palais royal he called out   12.93056099073902
d artagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men   13.98367549485664
her hôtel was remarkably sumptuous and while the most part of the english had quit or were about to quit france on account of the war milady had just been laying out much money upon her residence   11.118006087447043
the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian   6.496189421430042
she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night   11.455460021604628
decidedly   7.767987461637835
d artagnan pressed raoul s hand   14.478110775659001
the champs élysées   3.64015095740306
dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak   13.476839731076305
well then that is settled   6.550100304758094
0085m nay madame   6.4028105377674365
he murmured   14.64018457163803
valentine durst not oppose her grandmother s wish the cause of which she did not know and an instant afterwards villefort entered   8.862382785557887
the three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around d artagnan and his companions   16.81804225094357
nothing   5.135574882163877
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there   13.60382535419573
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours   13.73967965587934
well that is not impossible   7.831020534856988
porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage but with the eye of a jealous woman mme   8.407424209114915
0335m there you see wife said the former this splendid diamond might all be ours if we chose   14.798516575480923
the feet did not bespeak the woman of quality   14.748284940549084
one moment said the prisoner in french   19.589607345121212
he leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier   9.273450178138598
our expedition lasted nearly six weeks   7.689674279789568
but do not fear it   17.205121737716723
you are right that is the principle on which i wish to act   16.35453674378535
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at   20.505640944766565
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word   14.706637146240695
and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride   12.968039030944693
as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail   16.534454338430493
i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur d emery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity   10.833653527367202
then let them explain themselves   7.780734321539162
woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said mousqueton to himself   15.757765189970547
it is doubtless some spy   8.199686937640646
0277m pretty strong rum   7.308218188631442
i do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask m   20.140775755026745
i threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that i mightn t break my promise and strangle grimaud   5.109933791597192
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it   10.27392922669261
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine o clock in the morning to take a third letter   7.200944845576113
well then i count on you   17.8494021810827
speak   23.07937007749186
possessing five and twenty thousand francs a year besides your place   10.739867703221424
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem   12.80096857776911
i have nothing more to ask of heaven i have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were   13.646846387182626
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her   12.698284550870651
believe me i am glad to see you   14.553675117085325
what you would now do amounts to treason   8.818740541698746
i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so   12.151228657212059
the steward entered   14.589122016949133
and one day when we were viewing an execution i thought i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit   9.507983345757077
sir said m   6.448942354925745
pardieu that is exactly the worst of all   11.444904678740686
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans   5.3828005088941016
but sit down dear friend to table   13.965261923028262
said the light horseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds   11.659988491014527
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night   12.286727496996324
cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force   15.619063027036905
de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost   7.376375528584594
he knows how as you must have observed to obey an order for you did not i am sure come from portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak   13.516507900454442
de monte cristo digging underneath these trees found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there   15.89902194315712
no monsieur he has not a lady with him   11.602934514281973
i will not fail   18.491346171677066
dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet   13.297388089177023
andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale   15.243599952521572
then it was so murmured winter and the next day henry iv   12.877128069190393
you see i have not these necessary papers   7.6522171606193545
but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real   14.033538332128325
we need only a week to amend all that   5.624115386396443
and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work   15.777522949132774
he was to wait at the gate   7.826396218538712
i was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls   7.424182920688758
the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grimaud s eyes   22.224149402977908
but i m his cousin   12.646730124676246
monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice   16.933996170064844
although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all d artagnan wished   20.490637467892473
de tréville s office   16.453447442459858
but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shut up houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven   11.517145786421018
the executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his bed   19.36408779289816
then in that case i shall always choose to remain there   11.144291308922538
you have no right to put me to death alone   12.650382302282386
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him   10.712064665284853
as queen catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous broussel to them i will strangle him with my own hands   17.979794434264413
and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter   9.73952119536021
two one here and one there   8.457378596723498
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach   20.44758733451844
her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the accused   16.218287764460385
once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction   11.719194792451196
go and fetch it   6.405002071167289
ah true   14.053715054735795
it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death   13.179053956999166
and where shall i find you   13.42167575347753
no one but you appeared to be so   14.771818289034357
it is fifteen years since i gave up the office   18.720644602772197
cahusac turned   16.005623737464617
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one   10.81484810534947
and he tapped thrice two taps close together and pretty hard the other after an interval and lighter   0.7529937240803815
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty   16.52456714325451
bonacieux he ran full of joy to seek his comrades whom he had left only half an hour before but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied   16.896281713595016
i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina fatigued with long service here haydée cast a significant glance at monte cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative   17.562741559261152
this was in fact a custom familiar to him   16.883158989824686
windows   5.657396522510655
there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this   11.86650306151266
cried d artagnan   11.47211916591213
he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come   11.084397257583143
perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant   13.268365500410923
d épinay consented to our all living together   6.543621500947749
it is of that prisoner that i wish to speak to your grace replied felton   6.251468398030362
de tréville was the father of his soldiers   6.774192907635168
certainly   5.144013146482561
you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free   12.201074559772254
of how much does he rob you every year   10.808011672453969
as to felton he hesitates   7.074852325389509
but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone hush   20.6169596075467
mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden and you madame were under the trellis of some arbor   9.698784599847365
only their wish to see each other had become a necessity and they would have preferred death to a day s separation   16.030230022369345
repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name   12.764025463287673
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure   9.772272084911522
the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wharf   12.526085230189734
i tell you valentine s life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of m   15.558205532642326
and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays   15.421440894634799
the chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and retired   15.599785706109692

the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges   16.169876007162905
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master   25.134553566501992
50039m oh the magnificent hair   11.889090512393059
he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him   15.070618976234645
for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection   8.65430232588858
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head   13.76627341649559
police affairs   16.137833864670437
the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted   11.794048053040509
how miserable not to be free   16.282710360551842

why really the thing becomes more and more dramatic explain yourself   7.117180100955948
all this negotiation must be carried on openly   6.299115468499128
d avrigny and villefort laid him on a couch   12.543492249886109

athos took his son s horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee   13.030014974171213
seeing you constantly surrounded by musketeers of a very superb appearance and knowing that these musketeers belong to monsieur de tréville and were consequently enemies of the cardinal i thought that you and your friends while rendering justice to your poor queen would be pleased to play his eminence an ill turn   14.876072916214534
you are captain mordaunt   7.704144447013824
but where shall we go   5.832866936484314
you knew him   6.759069556932449
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress   12.84210260307368
they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses   8.629587373378772
why did you not think of me ungrateful man   10.666951030400927
athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege   14.102955691982082
we are invited replied d artagnan to pass the night with m   11.664330314992036
he cried throwing down his knife   7.674990890113289
the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de condé although i must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs   14.545702857467143
nevertheless d artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him   10.835882624860522
then when i shall have learned what i desire to know i will withdraw   16.757214314321338
the gascon is the devil   11.206785912977656

her position in the count s establishment is not sufficiently understood   15.717607846049663
policar morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon   10.160575153131152
well let us set out   1.7233741370650257

franz returned to the manuscript and continued sir said the president you have been invited to join this assembly you were not forced here   22.184259878048945
a hundred thousand francs   8.669109783783673

morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve   16.439260663946015
for you are the only young man to whom i have hitherto spoken as i have done to you   12.82406147250592
the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him   3.84468142238595
perhaps i turned pale and trembled but certainly i smiled   11.395536982783712
then let us pray to heaven said the girl   9.147210256075418
0191m the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dantès plate and dantès after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day   16.69289899355848
i command you to speak   13.683646462111977
such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant   6.215088076653049
asked aramis   15.679480973049122
the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface   13.789124716380812
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage   10.965540300382695
wait said athos   10.758065854784798
will that satisfy you   18.13714579894402
tell it athos tell it   16.599848789186836
yes   8.61888507927927
not before me behind me   10.027143898861803
now barring all that i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl   9.249125792427034
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie   10.147723205419167
you acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him   10.628794155478843
you are now sanguinary   10.219249340546963
olivain   13.709058852629898
oh yes yes cried the baroness   9.686168782051368
i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone replied morcerf but i am reluctantly obliged to confess i have nothing further to communicate yes stay i do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count i heard the sound of a guzla it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own   11.84432270436942
he is not a prince   17.872827088374716
what   13.82313060656795
but he thought this addition would do no harm   9.625621524362646
i do not hear her breathe   8.389178368236747
replied dantès   11.475349210711514
but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream   13.680479322488926
so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it   9.566014336187685
said he showing it   9.849711807471035
in fact the rochellais had made a sortie during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before   1.2447423680904048
if you arrive safely at home what have i to fear except from you   15.714043111743635
you are dressed   21.6731669020971
i seek to divine nothing madame   10.959211298807677
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man   9.794889824169104
ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know nothing   12.995472511241314
the army i will answer for it will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs   12.768122992042683
d artagnan opened the letter and read as follows this is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love you   9.246980935095468
we can only save you by being free ourselves replied d artagnan in a rapid low tone   18.590890488405137
it means that i have just returned from yanina   9.523356084947217
you say we are going to see athos now and if you will come thither i beg you to make haste for we have lost much time already   15.789653218605533
at the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his foreknees   14.400149550834245
trust me don t let us try to do things cheaply   12.791187894301679
for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for peppino called rocca priori   12.287626677795021
let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digestion   13.011744194433405
i hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit   11.18917445836843
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father   14.014798590881623
and you monsieur porthos   9.928444555074613
i see fresh tracks   8.422471565611808
athos bowed   7.114500775328292
do you wish to see anything more sir   11.24059644047084
while reading this letter d artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers   5.393484833020362
and i   11.929846413693376
but don t think yourselves in a better position than you are   2.587599826232763
but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort   6.494524348888764
you know the marquis of saint méran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival   9.241035632657399
what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort   20.38773991357187
the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port hole   12.552185549069788
and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them   14.997292506527526
what fortune has she   10.875814556687779
asked valentine   17.701849649909988
has not some sage said nothing too much   8.278714905064781
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me   12.667232840245827
said monte cristo   6.655666279321168
but without fail   12.42033351121754
really it is only in france these things are done   8.445863722045264
to seek my friends   14.090405907286714
i am very desirous of being so my lord but i am totally in the dark about everything   7.425266659978079
the seventh he let it remain upraised   13.583034758887209
more reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament   10.99274687780904
these keys were given up to him instantly   7.3764729746644475
m   7.943945038954154
his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass   11.437677465831051
the count bowed his head and clasped his hands together   13.018390825525818
charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king   9.631318875473875
as for me i hate the court and have but one desire at this moment vengeance   9.533093480092875
and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not   8.222353238425676
well m   10.661659540250971
said d artagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing   11.770255869367451
and what is become of this benedetto   11.461074134591078
it means at once come enter you are welcome   8.768591206401762
yes sir i know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the ink   9.734532587182372
tis i who am too soon   8.63994861044662
but even while they watched his daring progress edmond s foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear   10.805640458694795
i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans   14.705351228587807
morrel unhappy   11.546192166459482
that they must have patience said anne as i have   16.017227291874242
and i mine said porthos   12.097623965707081
i am in a fever said she   16.54894359865998
our interview must be kept secret   12.716332869854062
did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter   4.686150062049941
very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent english   12.251169100803747
rita lay between them   7.292590999952994
this will change the aspect of french affairs but i much fear it will do nothing for english even if it does not harm them   10.117655527196026
as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and i picked up a million from which 250 000 francs were paid to you for pin money   10.686548928633112
but with that perfect self possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria dantès coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation   11.979614790357632
here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment   16.155644593897524
bah   20.027506287668686
i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination   6.242195163587712
no   4.890660726054929
it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat   14.966781858564872
do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion   19.739150068177253
when the maltese for so they called dantès had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly   11.756601484781816
go   7.59402286737274
and what is it saying anything you understand   22.340859479466022
yes   5.654349351258354
tell him also that i am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at amiens   6.969720121350753
come and open then   14.848260702961266
no   11.864975345940195
said caderousse in a choking voice i was there   5.774535815607671
i tell you what i have been told   6.131351944345169
d épinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations   11.992624540995184
saint denis   8.731087544659047
yes said he yes anne of austria is my true queen   12.295278137649024
impudent fellow   7.876231341944136
not too well   11.981471931908946
the house is sold then   9.146462582035637
and he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box   14.931289636837636
but wait   6.414281767920326
everything in her mind was lost for an instant   16.856614275036563
they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed   12.442795261472257
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them   11.908344702718368
when you arrived madame de saint méran had already been panting for breath some minutes   13.912069971478214
the queen can not you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess   9.610493142001825
and she stepped back to retire   7.714572824131005
that his eminence has ordered you to england and that monsieur d artagnan is waiting for you in the stables   6.739357930161795
but why are you thus agitated   14.620692638404364
the pont du gard inn chapter 27   20.543964175867416
what our enemies say of us is then true   10.448425465859803
so you refuse my request   15.192635406623967
mordaunt   14.637460921271188
now will you make me a report of all that has happened   10.270146521205914
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers   16.894192523030522
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal   3.4865487539011983
i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you   14.822940729778331
and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity   9.51802524985117
really   14.367913220758176
do not do anything of the sort   15.968969142907042
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men   11.144472177024117
alone in the world   10.952051225328969
thought mazarin   6.1369952437776645
17 the genoese conspirator   8.339124463262412
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot   12.12123672137698
meanwhile kitty when we are about to separate and you are no longer jealous of me monsieur chevalier far off or near said kitty i shall always love you   9.15772818685023
thus while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left she broke out into sobs and tears   16.254649980583313
and could you not stop your fatal career if you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it   11.95440958660545
i not only confess it but am proud of it returned the gascon   6.466968769702833
her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels   10.822555748179333
chapter lxvii   16.11213784381847
why do you say that   11.503570414028655
it was a vendetta followed by restitution   11.934922545109508
said anne of austria   16.88168753835046
without doubt   10.45974618348894
his words were brief and expressive conveying all that was meant and no more   14.887966755484538
she had laid that down the preceding evening   16.311015628201122
of certain expenses he has contracted   11.616838655902502
d artagnan   7.70822496064808
then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a corner   13.89263035358985
by the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized planchet   12.214839581129196
but you my dear d artagnan   10.501006706855508
yes my wife pointed him out to me one day   14.77807693037074
oh my dear d artagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me   14.285978040241933
the house was now being searched   13.499632138410435
dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on end   8.65437678333316
i think it will be wise to set off said d artagnan   15.244571605532137
i saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses i heard my glass removed the same which is there now on the table   14.616221854651856
these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos which the besieged himself demolished   14.217168474636829
i suffer from emotion   15.31525679745246
you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid   1.4575261388869354
dantès   10.78399092915431
let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives   13.82544032752394
for as i had the honor to tell you my wife loves me dearly my wife then came and confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great fears   14.053791238036421
it was said that madame de longueville for whom the prince had more than a brother s affection and in whom he had confided had been indiscreet   8.053422571485978
though he was in his own element   7.752859940960028
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses   11.896925743426623
and who was he   18.451968696762734
that man is cromwell said he   15.191015348255082
at eight o clock in the morning morrel entered their chamber   11.911508714350553
sir said raoul returning the count s pressure of the hand i like you already from my heart   10.971273039435275
i shall still have my place   13.156909578954524
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him   17.43817870140146
morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste   4.583351238029591
yes   12.383537483153173
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around   16.999255203632437
then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again   4.29797728140369
i do wish to ask your advice said madame danglars with anxious expectation   9.619855967333613
but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned   10.78331956252603
i did indeed   17.047764527080105
a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure   17.030099022563917
still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days she was sure he was well   2.8024880924315045
but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality   11.073747984099855
asked the marquis remarking the cloud on villefort s brow   13.126712835946577
at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room   10.7633080461904
besides we are safe for to day   14.088261390396312
and by whom   11.606967247129477
30   15.350295385115494
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo   6.122501578358636
chapter xv   12.383109365148789
then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and exposed   14.182790765337051
but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition a function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish i prefer my own specific   14.610287163652952
listen he said   13.90412360311715
the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs   8.241931421471051
i wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil   12.73733694639799
the procurator seeing he was going invited him to dinner an invitation which the musketeer refused with a majestic air   14.31620548083435
and charles i   12.34782919907754
but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection   12.480767827897074
mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters   8.305210218026867
it is all one to me now said d artagnan   12.132730524341657
in the name of heaven   16.73634410922105
he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are saved the bark is supplied with provisions   16.074920749829793
d artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform   13.722382801056778
haydée had taken away ali and bertuccio remained with noirtier   10.328616538652117
athos and porthos dragged me into this to occupy me   4.642306600998809
reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office my father died because he could not do what i have this day done   12.238182993554055
d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned   15.01975024859386
perfect madame as you have seen replied the count   4.717934324027893
mazarin now understood that cromwell s envoy desired to retain his incognito   0.8039645542578988
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercédès and his father could have joined him   12.534429775244172
who can tell whether dantès be innocent or guilty   10.675593585195925
then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance   14.016858810601208
on the contrary i esteem them but will not have them   8.278555741638579
wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting up   9.924012771888886
i should be sorry to advise you in the matter   13.255159457706629
why you are like no   6.694116038670064
but there is always the same result   13.8397233623128
she opened it and seeing that the old man s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns   12.926035025114409
i shall borrow from the queen   17.37109207099008
does your majesty remember when playing in the park of fontainebleau or in the palace courts at versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder   21.961501902502196
arrived at this last hue it changed no more   12.33618011734494
that s my concern   11.50521265250799
i neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by me   23.4982571190981
he called it using his advantages   13.097986471476588
hum   15.42882650657
dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous   16.707571906177055
some voices even added long live the marshal   15.968877603118024
nobody by the faith of a gentleman   14.866980076683287
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped   10.128726799045602
and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is about   15.568754101510136
there has been fighting then   10.445526966831384
sebastian where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing cæsar s commentaries and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six o clock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker s at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist   12.150351130748339
will you be ambassador albert   15.828317630319724
the youth brought a small loaf   13.328707799052573
beware of a profane taste in your theological style   15.51024487629405
d artagnan is for mazarin he said to himself   8.254779141569761
zounds   18.64878072153425
deschamps place beauveau faubourg saint honoré and you have my authority to inspect those deeds   8.714693127960695
chapter xxxiv   13.176867662560397
have you ever heard of him   12.853165768106361
why the music you have been listening to   13.155869149351899
noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her   14.696927166368482
ask day after to morrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle and who is no other than noirmont your former maitre d hotel   14.235914969192365
these studs can not be trusted to anybody   13.648068828447167
dear grandfather   17.544741497873314
be satisfied replied felton   13.813570480902108
i was going out sir   20.30124174433361
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own   10.539956875119353
but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight   15.286725534240508
exactly   16.25670359937574
i have arranged two plans   11.915669645424277
when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos porthos drew his dripping hand from the font   10.732781361461845
you have thews of iron a wrist of steel   6.920407517558786
morrel morrel cried my father stop a bit   14.419413910027302
you persist then   14.440761136658015
support a double weight   12.549490803228716
confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a deep heavy slumber   10.633136039490013
demanded the inspector   11.129983850989039
all this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so good natured who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year   15.672477509249564
he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause   20.933318404904902
at last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent weather   16.31576532976458
have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them   6.059873821131635
but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille   15.869987744908968
the storm will blow over more easily believe me   8.255016627807178
but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured   11.9750500655799
the pardon the next day danglars was again hungry   11.853903151403617
now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way   9.570721768562843
yes   15.454928887010215
i will undertake to divert him replied the count   8.5802407928056
that manoeuvre has saved my life several times   10.578272110694867
m   5.766814584094563
he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady   16.574894032428745
i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles   11.774438555854333
there was but one tavern the post   13.36398704755801
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his horse   19.3322461534968
i know a man who will find the means of taking me from paris a man i have too long forgotten   14.183577178841563
grimaud s agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news   13.031916639556371
on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall oh god   9.271719831817208
the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the abbé faria had spread the riches of his mind   10.917880680526116
you are not an enemy of our holy faith   12.743220925745042
said planchet is it you   18.694261393556523
because said andrea with a certain ill concealed uneasiness i thought i heard my father in law say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now   13.961518729026444
yes said athos   11.346598907894105
oh said morrel i know not indeed if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count morrel hesitated   5.173023207753754
he went the first time to save the honor of a great queen   14.370138124093064
well said gondy have you kept your word with me   12.882943642658397
ah   16.91151043877811
he mentally ejaculated   13.73087088573244
but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between lucien s visit and the curiosity of the baroness   12.177469983858861
good   14.79200269995463
the principal charge against you is this letter and you see villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed   7.120419051845137
you know the axiom non bis in idem   8.257400141330523
exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day   11.275691109218867
d artagnan did the same   8.89004424223834
presently they heard milady retire to her room   7.381899687534921
while working night and day i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel   8.820363650077404
i do not feel remorse because that woman i profoundly hold deserved her punishment   16.62533369151721
but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent   15.191495926273767
no one has come out he replied   14.41544034308728
we are friends are we not   5.848433185341376
yes you are right replied villefort surprised   11.975957361063543
he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles   11.139454019044269
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them   15.123335910511281
wait   12.559604114895523
he ill treated you then   9.335186742081497
these gentlemen should file off into normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach paris   18.305074234033732
on their way they met grimaud   2.3165497983767214
nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a crœsus   11.277069190118462
still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels   8.710983520230897
gallop fast planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left   13.6230339919073
this was all that milady could endure   13.096814964747749
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino   11.482669365561293
only to make a woman of thirty nine look like a woman of fifty   9.920645768987892
i hope to be captain without that said dantès   6.8689167707064485
none   10.494970590641152
she was his mother   13.541296436657733
it is true i fought with tolerable success   7.854044005326202
here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments   15.066231356951816
edmond s hair stood on end and he rose to his knees   8.750878605520704
for my part i declare i want two thousand   12.894895539458492
and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone   15.8642027593155
no mademoiselle said monte cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question   15.083050548455066
go   10.216263970044512
it is as i have said maximilian there is no one in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my grandfather who is little better than a corpse no support to cling to but my mother in heaven   14.307492138313586
said athos laughing   15.224096906705139
said albert   13.998166189103852
did you remark that man who is following us   13.443738542581226
and at this moment i have absolutely nothing to do   4.31086644884067
you will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs   12.518490269280411
said beauchamp   8.508403737737877
he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence   9.455822782475986
one might believe this is an allusion to the queen mother   13.42367379310475
i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces   6.703007434718778
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m   11.299547367569504
listen said he   16.718381619922916
there is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet   12.908797284144425
when besieging paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls   14.257919140549603
attention porthos   17.324467858539016
albert said beauchamp with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and talk   6.068524893617955
that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited   16.52157460102491
the young girl hastily took the letter from him   17.938220094956375
you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them   17.617735453017026
and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed he was able to provide for the wants of all for a fortnight   10.384997974794762
no you were not for it was in reality a little boy   7.299228804820967
i   12.991112868100627
what are you thinking of   18.044667774627424
i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own   5.950889973167231
it would be a curious idea and maybe i should find my friend under the name of achilles   8.997577839223858
the conflict was not long   15.267517711543777
the father of m   14.690888207434012
stop rascal   1.3458964699607616
the park is twenty acres twenty comprising kitchen gardens and a common   10.628955859587334
what is he waiting for   6.912908944559237
we are coming to the point whispered the governor   5.824618879747663
how do you do   15.022438757115749
that is all very simple you had business in england   14.464657728432707
on the contrary sir i have ten   14.93833544412471
so saying the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse   7.979441423498977
said anne of austria drawing herself up to her full height and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening   10.745418148268296
ah my friend   16.709876336630174
she was branded   18.539144540322486
every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves   13.248664739803573
he was a medical man i think   11.247649201460613
the fowl had not been poisoned she had died of apoplexy   19.364758162961987
your very grateful milady clarik that s all very simple said d artagnan   11.937428713647947
cried d artagnan   7.247178418521705
i prize it it was given to my ancestor by king francis i   14.717458556026473
as to franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days   13.292279607287814
i know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myself it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice and i must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god   7.578638676202185
and you say this treasure amounts to two millions of roman crowns   17.300936660782178
is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him   11.966535557362679
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tréport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic   10.828986811963713
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving d artagnan learned that he exercised from six o clock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine o clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern   6.954453167402276
go thither and if there be none well well continued louis xviii   7.910912369315463
take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother   18.48972882373826
come with me my friend said the englishman   20.773545052463625
noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me   7.728891025561029
at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment   17.871805975644925
michael   17.2393495820089
a tuscan count   10.05051951093979
the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there   10.776498684053738
at any hour you will   10.470757373393596
from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost   4.9406092157148205
into the service the king s service   17.195396160015825
meanwhile we shall reach london with the king   5.720856801511154
you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes   11.571705190395466
and you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father   11.392091064659736
and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin   7.801446903143165
when shall i strike   13.468392177198659
what do you mean to do with that purse   9.489456539275782
he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers   10.772057466012567
good and beautiful as you are   10.997216901154593
open the door then my lord and be so good as to remember once for all that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest cry for help our position being very critical indeed you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities   9.72909705421808
last evening   17.291687746118882
i hasten to do so   17.543174521626884

bravo   12.617947939120073
villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return   7.437243489315517
mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven   10.352526724063795
there are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty   12.558424327353395
oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis   4.885127282922388
wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out   8.04610481811476
25th april 149 well   8.865523663384304

de boville s study   16.213485406117375
cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure   7.7469887711857695
the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected   11.665754387781668
0137m in the first place and before everything else sir is the news as bad in your opinion as i am asked to believe   16.25851836675862
my friend said aramis if you like to ascend i shall be delighted to receive you   8.959740550629647
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience   14.888661464816506
three months passed away   15.801731909229623
in an instant the horse s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam   10.18595402723987
we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter for whom he seemed to have a great regard   11.435249231363064
that is useless   0.26280326816064736
upon a word from her i would betray my country i would betray my king i would betray my god   15.07924603543028
the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand   9.042697672331665
juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his confession   15.068908795170604
monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left   15.823767203500644
possibly thought d artagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts   17.54311497004524
i won t ask anything more of you   11.777816808731183
but one consideration restrained him   11.547489932006437
bonacieux   15.172301671866858
that s well   11.75867819764167
this is the way in which you northerns understand chemistry madame   22.02687016034794
he may have gone by the other door   12.47151125972883
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her d artagnan would have returned home since he had so promised   16.228803854025927
d artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes   7.792117105703208
of course said d artagnan   13.77474370874727
i therefore may hesitate between you   9.53502228761691
oh she did love me   6.02760279463453
the young man pressed valentine s hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase   15.460285892863983
faria saw this   14.237930139602117
patrick again obeyed   19.994382835584815
more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp   5.158385224748787
no   15.1716712219664
he had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy   20.786572530715794
you can sleep here   12.993189018995027
what letter   8.004298689466399
but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against you   10.68597337825649
all right   9.656903016822724
as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended   14.617147644934615
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber   8.73407702352053
no your holiness i take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor   14.67369692045123
her pretty face arrested my attention   13.25370200695123
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose   11.23092533144682
if my mother could know of this attention on your part and i will venture to tell her i am sure that she will be most grateful to you   9.709790021451042
replied d artagnan   18.316218525840426
it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven   15.941610415656875
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him   7.257502893076548
both were very handsome but of quite different styles of beauty   9.106151581359935
count count   14.325470440552913
and he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after madame danglars departure before he left the house   6.764055888951683
on the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death   7.503949630048103
cried morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage   13.536879628100746
but how shall i address the minister   10.451093637756044
de tréville wanted   13.18505628786653
this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe   14.482054364899824
still marquise it has been so with other usurpers cromwell for instance who was not half so bad as napoleon had his partisans and advocates   16.19551345945368
a singular introduction   15.125983300026792
have you not yet divined who he is   6.532430466832255
noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side   4.845195626779501
yes   13.831991419709171
i will be the avenger   9.933862002873639
what he did during these ten years god only knows   14.465056989068426
the count of monte cristo   11.630731793986778
i fancy i have heard so   17.572995903457084
d artagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody tragedy   15.003722004206917
you have described him feature for feature   15.090671702962828
whispered aramis to athos did you see   7.697599015558565
an affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in paris   15.00400245328039
messrs   14.269176756417046
months and years rolled on   11.985065370246357
and both again left the room   14.333096817314658
morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owner s hand m   12.14228226273953
asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy   15.509121723899952
enough   12.229255702235875

there remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain   13.919561109847455

on the contrary we are all free agents   12.647892621390334
the daughter of ali pasha   7.984268797867217
when   14.089502788991732
the musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom d artagnan had given to comminges appeared   10.363587829847713
this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it   11.524705715403718
no indeed   9.901680261193533
de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips   12.636542122674761
oh as to that i can speak positively your eminence   5.78037624782811
no part of the programme differed the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information   15.413631797715666
i told him very humbly for i could not conceal from myself the scrape i had got into by laying hands on one of his majesty s musketeers i told him i was quite ready to submit to his conditions   22.406446144221867
i shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that   11.875956926388952
fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercédès did not even feel   16.893093280856355
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrate s first impulse was to pause   17.920836261183076
i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth   14.508866907216614
how do you know that he does   21.200261939898486
ah my poor d artagnan   12.642656068967346
the queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question   7.399879184945591
it was nine o clock   10.919103703280854
but a humpbacked general   7.48689544820071
forty thousand francs income i think you said   15.89146365881512
i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercédès   20.14681732193879
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service   10.582284360009982
when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still   9.621745749593696
then shaking his head sorrowfully poor haydée said he   9.43936156172016
i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time   9.241038495236113
he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them   6.941362209874871
you don t know all yet   8.56887520384544
but dantès can not remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration   15.428034291989116
40227m the stranger cast one look around her to be certain that they were quite alone   9.075400332727652
and let us admit it the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to speak   7.153917874062913
hush   7.125391760242034
your strength will return   11.414115083949289
the boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for d artagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors   13.614144832606561
now mancini was a nephew of mazarin s and was as much hated by louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister   11.086447605886677
i congratulate you   10.409906810572213

the cardinal there awaited louis xiii   10.456612815541241
all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of aramis   4.73083760694225
i am not willing it should be known i have left the camp   13.123451585291901
albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros   11.767891758220154
at this letter the eloquent eye of noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop   19.634520860945784
mordaunt recoiled   14.100658799947205
humann section of the indirect contributions corridor a   6.72086042949256
alas   12.250624843198247
but i must warn you that we have no time to lose   4.065037739581964
in a moment sir answered dantès and i m with you   10.828675591361822
0351m oh sir said caderousse putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow oh sir do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man   13.43014335745947
and your servants too how very well behaved they are   11.894578406930286
listen continued villefort   9.153334812788422
she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going   14.297965111507333
and further that he stated to m   8.78659436291909
still the death of one old man always considerably affects another   19.34654736380088
it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists   9.905586515884586
a man whose name is franz d épinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them   13.260481827350556
adieu then   17.97439039564275
another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving   13.528835426613735
very well   12.41859529345852
then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him   7.528510631187295
oh no monsieur he is very young   14.913207322136145
do you not perceive that we are opposite the hôtel d arguillon which is full of the cardinal s creatures   7.782410879604199
hallo fernand   20.41251083919955
i had forgotten it   13.282440272211051
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomas du louvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men   16.3166442411875
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me   11.148182657745059
the trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street door   15.884533140018418
this fashion is coming in   12.356298993990597
the king was a few steps behind me when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow   9.259534533636623
yes that s probable said d artagnan   12.53616950006025
the emperor is no longer on the throne then   16.54285551237571

besides make yourselves easy   7.116469727430085
he had not done so for ten years before   13.517983827469019
this idea occurred to me and did not leave me   15.064576130448602
you are safe you are free   17.27714682352879
read it yourself and monte cristo passed a paper to albert   18.906393364723826
he then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back   4.815325692203675
if we say one hundred pistoles for the three good for the hundred pistoles   16.153303512701243
ah in such a case one supposes sister sister said maximilian coming to the count s aid monsieur is quite right   8.928877721367442
but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la réserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart   15.008741965941537
in 1807 a month before i was arrested and a fortnight after the death of the count of spada on the 25th of december you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory i was reading for the thousandth time the papers i was arranging for the palace was sold to a stranger and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence intending to take with me twelve thousand francs i possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten my head dropped on my hands and i fell asleep about three o clock in the afternoon   12.691586624333452
spur spur   2.639873849999585
that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated hanged and made away with concini   13.630548712143252

yes replied m   9.114563620100949
then the diamond is safe   12.41857806319612

cried mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation   12.310037964760028
i was at rome during the last carnival   10.17649313249736

they were his friends and not mine   6.909553961753588
the most important thing was not to kill him only for i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred times but to kill him without being discovered at least without being arrested   7.659667117929188
as sterne said   13.166695886335349

de tréville contented himself with asking d artagnan if he could do anything for him but d artagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted   9.206603089795227
no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more   18.506470436402438
you are all mistaken gentlemen answered athos gravely   18.716544002932814

bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation   15.63476239868028
and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours   13.014767867413102
why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert   11.341712101749096

yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards andrea and slipping a packet of bank notes into the young man s hand   17.326952304361647
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting   14.24631296201239

as your excellency may have observed your horse is in the great gateway ready saddled for your departure   17.051699098389072

you must lay in a stock of hilarity   11.931357691994606
as he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying al suo commodo   12.481152426684364
strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life   13.567795864684422

nevertheless i give it to you with great pleasure   13.937525758022943
it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory   9.476447638727112
and slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the count s hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by monte cristo   7.21092688304988
be easy on that head replied athos   13.412405305372728
one moment longer and all would disappear   16.173620930150484
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you   3.456977872891777
but i must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred livres   13.8990996311635
well you can go out by that door whenever you please   12.345466147111221

i could not see the expression of his countenance but i felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed   11.54550731252499
and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group   6.264704874770589
so bitter that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste   17.539514634537664
as for the count he just touched the dishes   10.791404592171398
but then he breakfasted with me indeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion   14.793325901212476
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project   11.783820779010602
eh parbleu   10.070992856719306
your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not   16.85942856439464
it is you who sent by him to constantinople to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor brought back a false mandate granting full pardon   15.60960915740652
egad said d artagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren   8.084784185759757
noirtier i resolved to try one last means and for three months i have been giving him brucine   11.497203971080912
all doubt of his identity was now at an end   12.277623601049523
i called to you but you did not answer me   10.230637076019002
excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this morning   12.193110388484273
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead   12.11765167671727
then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table   13.646457156033524
whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion   12.119710485178958
then i confess to you that i have eaten nothing since ten o clock this morning and i am devilish hungry   12.397000977616992
gentlemen good morning   14.345984909112527

when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon   16.311770727707025
our boat is waiting for us there   16.207054561227796
cried the host   17.529473253764994

she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you   14.738717448117725
by whom did the queen send you this jewel   10.163927598519845
besides when that note is delivered in all probability you will have no more to fear   19.78783988165703
porthos s chamber is you say on the first story number one   9.24549934227783
it was seven o clock in the morning and daylight began to appear   9.5655072276541
but as i determined to have a house to myself i sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it   4.3949762458822255

sir cried morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am and what right i have to be here   13.717777583110049
upon my soul i am ready to die for your majesty   16.080311801353915
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all   13.545628300358628
these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman   15.807967193630617
in a moment the door was opened and madame de morcerf alighted leaning on her son s arm   12.179724022010607

four of these men were our musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just received   1.0068112354605354
there were two doors   6.735298761823828
m   8.64760901226466
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that d artagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you   14.82250460017145
i recognized you at the first glance   0.6701640080367302
what do you say to a thousand crowns   7.238583702020252
the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death   12.296299735340211
and porthos heaved another sigh   6.751773665662286
d artagnan had not been deceived   11.220225970653136
i resisted   9.347624728029599
stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million   7.7705208289929795
the thing suited him wonderfully well   14.480977695270244
i am planchet planchet whom you know well   9.898427062751109
your philosophy convinces me on my honor   14.933765617059345
doctor cried villefort alas doctor how often has man s justice been deceived by those fatal words   10.092819746816733
unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset   12.616215535192241
i promise you that   7.7347945206331925
bernouin came into the room   16.686343527395735
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside   10.863670753104028
stop stop   9.834084025962436
my faith   13.960599222464786
thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on   15.381878619041725
however the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief   6.45797033679257
but i will save him   15.822291294057443
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur   8.256424912731621
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation   17.259092324478104
cried d artagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation   11.082175871891007
but he refused   15.68357564235949
asked d artagnan   12.456792232532866
perhaps there is but one at this moment   12.040723807437631
cried grimaud   15.568886337839539
madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction   13.69784318325697
therefore as far as it lies in my power i endeavor to celebrate it by some 20237m heroic action interrupted château renaud   15.493160415707425
yes   12.874220274492801
yes i know that said buckingham   14.631512992878086
do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience   7.442179849524937
she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass plot where she fainted   6.218910424400169
good   12.142214630084753
thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice   14.311960639360024
the two children grew up together passing all their time with each other and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters   8.972574696081995
it does not matter   13.80858750979324
well said albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and i insist on a retractation being made   11.470946336922879
positively   11.06499509754588
pardieu   9.214288784879809
poverty pshaw   7.181940403622002
certainly   4.592606634088338
d artagnan porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy   16.01754345113686
i told you said mazarin that you had seen the queen   11.821531127299654
but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy   7.373551292712257
i heard the door open and shut and i remained overwhelmed less i confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself   10.937655294699443
and yet he reckoned and with reason on milady   13.354366760053741

as to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail   20.695049314685416
said cromwell the cloud passing away from his face   6.840036633344645
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil   14.187818014008192
0307m edmond was seized with vertigo   12.91261009412535
what says augustine on this subject severus sit clericorum verbo   11.55947342658539
laughing   14.150640610743027
and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids   15.528664562061214
e   15.205808233722648
i made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlestick   17.9114441989819
if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it   15.937201144412978
happiness almost stifles me   12.540971141564254
there s only one man in the world who could stay my hand   9.258994952614731
but this is trampling on the weak sir   16.416518308751208
thank you sir said albert smiling   25.512238582027102
he approached the wall and tried to climb it   14.435748377244938
let me look at you   5.072209141730989
a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged   8.332008533129777
and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop   19.979065944841118
a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl   9.759358541209805
and then he was older than any of us added d artagnan   12.386500476143787
is it my affair   8.988017177510425
a flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of milady   13.65850723296055
the captain of the musketeers was therefore admired feared and loved   19.098762120004835
asked dantès   10.096590135550194
but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended   14.79402482245466
over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a full length portrait of anne of austria so perfect in its resemblance that d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it   12.03679595791139
i have found a horse   12.393272536536422
tell me continued winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in france that henry iv   11.488755502852403
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much   14.613528370237443
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont to give him a substitute   17.635464365317688
these proceedings made d artagnan and porthos draw back   8.90579535734046
the jest however soon appeared to become earnest   15.705686465104186
admirable   10.562843247977598
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it   17.473150568265297
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle d armilly s fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantio s malediction on desdemona   8.281419566866562
a young man we can sketch his portrait at a dash   8.102188398065842
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague   7.456019164529765
our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight   12.867515694406556
there is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction   15.219954481569387
he will not sail   16.378545832119563
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram   15.090163365578109
the man was one of those puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around cromwell   14.63793060825108
cried the procurator s wife   10.90881184209149
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastile where he remained for twelve long years when his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves   16.76392071262842
a horse for planchet that s all   10.529392164529538
at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good   12.439916818658924
e   18.736944484017474
everyone expected an explosion on carlini s part   7.076163017804469
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time   13.323397654535974
asked the prince   6.731443546009397
oh my god   16.429922618380026
stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here   9.36189516860717
besides d artagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits   13.596399234365597
d avrigny struck his forehead with his hand   10.497482000701536
yes dear friend athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonable it was noble and generous   11.507903018313929
we have already asked that question said château renaud for none of us has seen him   8.874815319101401
on his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses laced   9.698363069133917
he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the south had small hands and feet   13.067856962678258
thank you sir answered the young man much moved   11.577390230960368
after the great rains which fell in january the seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital   17.24305631235141
some spy of the cardinal said de winter to him aside   17.378345363978458
monsieur said aramis parodying jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves   22.861023402778244
sir the favor i have to ask of you is not to call me mousqueton but mouston   14.937459145585711
you know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor broussel the father of the people   10.593515080565696
you drive don carlos out of spain   5.4662109567161234
no said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young man s society no   20.389233009345162
but we will return to my lord duke presently   16.91618846012661
elssler was dancing in le diable boiteux   10.271461890665606
grunted porthos   9.215534733950385
however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor a cockbill the jib boom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot   13.368383597966098
the superior and mme   17.346456921080716
but remarked madame de villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident   2.5054979556352173
the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase   13.613239585520015
i will do so   18.233566510762827
i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light   13.53611109349541
so that he still expects his money   9.688238541080256
the pardon chapter 117   9.146369769209224
this raillery exasperated jussac   16.746668849704392
raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to de winter departed   10.066061124703355
i have asked the headsman of bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief   10.95663786011337
i do not carry brutalism so far   19.38958669152629
you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened   12.594832091147014
i never visit ministers   18.218711271401865
la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted   14.36428952942272
adieu mademoiselle   11.659657228881304
said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero   13.701620074101223
let us pursue him and we shall overtake him   14.885343808012369
my dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within   7.4845291546435275
the count recalled baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter   16.377693220279443
said gondy   8.433877713305495
thanks to something better   7.30032977864564
to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall   19.243216241426282
for you know athos   9.954151864759416
she is perhaps dead   9.159380591924215
he cried   7.4421974976108345
this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable odor   15.072749846035178
but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him   12.51454641429531
thus the greater number of a man s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity   13.793315645582847
it is a fire   11.068779751389396
it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith   8.01174703952087
come come we must be off   10.01910562987916
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly only they had agreed to meet once a week about one o clock at the residence of athos seeing that he in agreement with the vow he had formed did not pass over the threshold of his door   10.964997123755698
a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect   9.336070467719633
a third sigh from porthos   12.29796299533549
but then he had the woman he loved still remaining   9.739541092038992
we have all wished for this interview and i trust it will convince you how ill formed are your objections to valentine s marriage   12.797436889205263
answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity   11.051491633565638
a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentine s room opened and monte cristo reappeared   8.315040532906378
it was ten o clock when they arrived   16.28144917039981
albert would not do us the honor to be jealous   16.004247382964067
to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speech which embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if i should ever be free so fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me   8.52657895747874
i want none   12.531156396084953
you see   9.646831489826594
you look at me and you are going to laugh at me   14.000966167363773
he took his fowling piece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure   12.849170769357325
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement   13.302432780521912
dantès closely and eagerly examined it   11.920510414526406
i understand you or rather i am wrong   9.23392690976885
that is to say you are invited m   13.010552731014155
to the health of the king monsieur   14.527655795498182
all the ladies rose and there was a profound silence   14.122480108409325
why do you call me baron   15.47245290104092
ah why were you not there gentlemen   13.310251473295027
said the voice in a threatening accent that i had never yet heard   9.129109034783369
what do you think of it my little fellow   4.199282226434869
remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service   13.668445828601255
a slight oscillation showed dantès that all went well   14.93052848857159
albert turned towards haydée   14.524139095201352
what are you going to do   6.795487245647045
at the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was satisfied   6.7697171913241645
at dice   9.948316089633256
the morning drum had just been beaten   9.715136320860946
but i must not forget one grand point   11.906215727260166
upon this promise d artagnan withdrew and the next day he began service   15.981110430663273
asked valentine timidly   4.017778307552502
danglars smiled and seemed to say it is of no consequence   16.47737826016565
let us separate and let us seek the mercer s wife that is the key of the intrigue   12.105152157795946
really m   17.684795868468317
exceedingly replied franz   7.07039687266475
1   19.202646761298645
i will   8.003245447055711
they have vexed you and you are angry   8.628485802376165
both were in shadow and the sybil of cuma herself could not have read them   11.26586494939511
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another   14.436700068331504
he took a quill wrote the name of d artagnan in the commission and returned it to him   11.101535675984948
you know men better than i do and what you say may possibly be the case i confess   9.387672429053456
i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight   15.878800075859608
grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the cavalcade   13.437460389893147
the stranger was about to reply   14.166183120911482
he is traveling on business and will return ere long   14.90365078570644
then all is agreed   13.212989453412025
a man on whom we can depend i hope   19.68296537719406
then my strength gave out and i fainted again   17.107531463675322
but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague   6.02540873521629
ah   9.136083638157427
in the first place i have never succeeded by that means   3.0255427751170405
that your mother and m   14.73263992133631
it is useless   16.280937581033495
very well let us say no more about it   4.50506551244513
answered the abbé   12.742391571667644
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest   14.200249706854436
still added he amid all this i have not yet been presented to mademoiselle eugénie danglars whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make   12.092553801438081
morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of dantès from m   7.824421791230077
the queen smiling made a sign with her head   13.750454097850557
this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall   11.878086924522654
therefore mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really was   6.62646697844596
my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father who was glancing anxiously around   10.383399817939983
for whom are you looking my fine fellow   13.677892108750628
have you really met with some great misfortune   4.450334132969154
and you are not so any longer   6.730295956814908
said athos offering his hand to d artagnan   12.937575221343822
he looked from one to the other and after mordaunt he recognized groslow   5.924653151294011
day came   11.299277401259461
talking of that said debray madame was making inquiries about that house which for the last three months has been hung with black   2.551553107296243
have you been satisfied with him this voyage   15.505307212358838
these were the lackeys of these gentlemen   9.270185320572827
madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you   14.476297033474767
paris is not paved with cambric   12.065306708394294
at that moment d artagnan passed in pursuit of milady   11.682415805168203
pardieu beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral   8.12653947875945
morrel i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you   7.370241835709395
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse   13.268929026911856
this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franz s countenance   14.97735492833591
come come calm yourself my sweet girl   14.012889813082472
look   13.710533341408901
make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles   14.486789490761723
with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentine s room of which he double locked the door   7.271884400099359
yes if i die   13.01234869679628
the police   15.545042394165032
ah here is a private staircase said the count   10.428286597587826
all along the road what athos had said respecting mme   17.715842525933553
and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouth pieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers   11.328604896994802
porthos opened his eyes in amazement   8.025890266642833
leu being not far from that locality   16.79142621145043
ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes   11.906422848257945
at your service sir he continued   7.184379899448367
granted   8.542945418732943
said franz   13.548667444187908
and thus they parted the best possible friends and m   13.488960795960953
i have seen him once replied grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection   16.28657230045509
i have this said he   13.717925094029864
he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing room before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a bow window and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father s departure   15.795844668968972
he unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it   9.459729236790741
and i was asleep cried raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details   3.9513804735227662
now the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarter day payment and scarron as usual had sent his servant to get his money at the pension office but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give monsieur scarron   13.177326402104105
bonacieux you speak that in a tone that frightens me   12.630678736248521
i am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the duke of buckingham to him whom you allowed to be assassinated to the duchess de chevreuse whom you suffered to be exiled to the duc de beaufort whom you imprisoned   4.8667802834385085
i have descended from a planet called grief   14.542504392839641
what is it   4.36908003237065
oh said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it   3.713722649736214
she is in the prison of nantes   5.72840101394018
still the walls seemed to be closing on him   20.05258918636616
i come to see you replied milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which d artagnan s letter had given birth in the mind of her brother in law and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood   12.90592909863608
40268m the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition   14.226756223883044
read that he said   12.999027671668767
you will soon know what to expect for here he is   11.968961183114267
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt   12.609493698527023
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette   14.375572016654647
i have resolved to fly with you not a word be ready   11.462236291253566
mercédès   15.140104957903212
i am not yet twenty one and eugénie is only seventeen   17.389835739817805
they are approaching said she   3.837156643503187
but to his friends to athos and aramis was apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety   9.510318199549218
as i rode by the count s house i perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain   11.953831139129889
you must be aware that i was ignorant of that madame   6.881129466670932
mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch   6.973664204363173
the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance   10.663273200482088
suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleon well can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellow creatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey   14.157964550551565
she belonged to one of the first families in italy i think did she not   6.114676756133654
where if you please   2.7284976911731125
really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france   13.368379026809743
i told her of the scaffold   10.455114056858164
until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone   14.562672583564698
the scotchman   0.6999909406760256
grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door   17.67255138181411
there is the wounded man said de guiche passing close to the augustine brother   13.471357049570283
and what was the end of this worthy man   12.117529672808065
they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered   17.037085178570113
yes said they all with one accord   11.325586687959602
she is there said he   15.10135280588867
delightful   11.778414348705287
never had he been so well received   7.0975250902360205
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward   7.685990946190734
oh   21.36941808421775
you are right   13.854855535555755
oho   11.918910236536549
morrel obeyed   11.760476219362076
it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20 000 francs apiece for his horses   9.077718460232218
and who is the assassin   18.24526996110393
who retreated a step and frowned   10.421988102866967
it appears that after having challenged m   15.337507962301746
let us know when breakfast is ready   16.581933326003796
the duchess was the first to speak   17.768117837264242
in a word an almost poetical fervor prevailed   11.28491221002735
yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen   19.59140787309203
the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo and we will go another   15.963913561589719
it was just five o clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear   11.136737283880715
how sire   16.64057264080828
the paralytic motioned yes   19.8094915278068
there she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapestry   8.282687575038796
it is more it is magnificent   9.110062003640682
yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cæsar spada   9.520556598441154
i can not hear such things said as that   24.89646092165114
the two friends were perfectly stupefied   13.334241889002417
all men are brothers said the puritan   17.551979478965844
that little compliment could not fail to move d artagnan   11.543774290395632
the count de la fere formerly styled athos   9.99195730837377
the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares   17.193331106620906
no said lord de winter we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england   15.802850292206175
then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank   15.344800274980892
said fernand   15.866714643004082
and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people   12.857399866978264
i raised my head quickly and saw mercédès who at once shut the blind   14.646781551785338
she terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation   20.57126538501415
murmured athos while porthos broke the bottles and aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent for   3.7509425645566647
thou must add said d artagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name   5.808344472166099
well let me see what can you want that begins with n   13.759951504591227
but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her will   5.975926399439446
well then marie michon had supper with her follower and then in accordance with the permission given her she entered the chamber of her host kitty meanwhile taking possession of an armchair in the room first entered where they had taken their supper   10.523613859666929
very well done   10.108585430937936
help me to deliver him   7.871948441119144
and he is very rich   11.264823639869686
morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake   2.0091743363113785
i agree monsieur   9.038841697051085
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle   14.65796985061971
it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination   11.813213888824276
i am under his orders for the next month   16.746546395567
presently it sounded one o clock   7.865115581323251
and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care   10.449717715372344
now by way of having a resting place during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookery which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him   11.792741319670856
this is one of those attempts that happen every day   17.030312170888834
chapter xxxv   13.419665961153235
said d artagnan   7.127541567125221
beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf   18.30093190674139
and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on you   7.12145640934651
d artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question   13.005790220815816
it was agreed in a brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nîmes to come to them as speedily as possible   9.033963215150205
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution   10.047688048052567
who knows   16.173173049209492
she said   12.739010047497944
ah the devil no cried albert   16.018150091867046
he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it   17.46320629618238
oh yes she exclaimed i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching brain   25.412966278192318
how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face he had been jeered at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life and m   14.242845329519076
the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past   13.0029440938608
and what he continued has been done with the poor body   12.337367535709074
it contains the number of my new abode   14.677977710270738
and nodding to planchet he went out   11.048513330080981
now in the army from the division generals who desire the death of the general in chief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some one s death   14.667064605158107
athos sighed deeply   15.110564549176509
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted   14.397213261911993
what is it   14.530731190178285
but reflect albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her   11.72263329506451
you speak to me before my servant   9.18865113010078
dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him   7.203391050167351
but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets   16.86190725123711
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it   16.4737523905959
the man carried me to the foundling asylum where i was registered under the number 37   5.198866340609865
it must then be the visitor he hoped for   8.833625117496556
my lord said d artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time   10.07557700443839
set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the hotel de la chevrette rue tiquetonne and there await me   15.711694660514102
reassure yourself   20.514234820264747
but i doubt that your object was like theirs to rescue the holy sepulchre   15.146663012963192
he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered   11.300448806720112
another might threaten to seek m   12.376223674772923
one of your guards my prince   6.272737782366371
apropos if you fire and you will do so for you are recommended to a young general who is very fond of powder remember that in single combat which often takes place in the cavalry never to fire the first shot   12.029107311460104
what can they have said   7.041793482891915
i am not mistaken   9.288054442913834
sir since you command the cavalry pardon me i am commander in chief   17.22205456680962
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph   18.06943887528382
smugglers are not thieves   13.096610527244861
your liberty was my ransom   11.31466360943544
he was an irishman one of the most skillful of his craft and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the duke of buckingham   17.62928691399991
then taking out his watch he added it is half past eleven   8.28658065456461
did she not love an englishman   12.533441356668266
since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cæsar wills that you die   12.628726314531086
yes sir   11.854622574480983
lord leven   15.27534006303812
no   10.517378081520937
help   14.120742830999694
the order given by mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by d artagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned athos and aramis to exercise extreme caution   11.939952195627871
aramis returned home and athos and d artagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire   12.759619465307255
the vision had fled   11.18496289070626
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars   2.6768125910368887
could i not   7.208859308888782
who told you that   11.51369120445716
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation   11.176037778786325
it is some cowardly assassination said de guiche   12.461724201469899
yes i understand it well   8.642232538386718
and he raised his cane six inches higher   13.21963561991764
god sends me this and i hail it joyfully   12.075605772429734
inquired dantès   7.461186414864754
his smile was at once cunning and resolute   10.539531119599777
edmond then resolved to try jacopo and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize money but jacopo refused it indignantly   15.713357998961309
paul s   6.243828037823514
it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us   9.185233105767091
and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz d épinay   6.729335518231171
a silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion   14.966533201378521
demanded the journalist   12.118667446145505
answered d artagnan   16.049299698086216
the door groaned upon its hinges   15.97630350418497
be satisfied my reverend father i can answer for myself   12.41432789025122
heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o clock   13.058514783936594
madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair   8.793834340497463
he said turning to d artagnan   5.725171458380066
no   11.964149775008277
then she rang for her lady s maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might happen   17.676392477995755
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass   4.41758289959563
yes and a sincere friend   9.133368448319668
monseigneur   11.762912132186246
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them   7.835933812125085
we burn as they say at the game of pincette   5.212119360026027
is it possible   15.532736191950383
oh yes and with all my heart   12.871321927727887
i dare say such a thing might be had   3.458007083074188
of the great cardinal   11.560780471654505
mother nanette   8.236318671676852
what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup   14.485612055381445
the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an ill bred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it   15.075988459386632
madame said athos passing his arm under that of d artagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman   12.814576581995794
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done   17.995860697159433
all hands obeyed and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul topsail sheets and halyards the jib downhaul and the topsail clewlines and buntlines   18.807365581158578
i want air that is all   9.896923892967436
what is it   18.349510324651238
in fact in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened   19.749223315140007
monsieur de chavigny be so good as to lend me your cane   21.19857714759489
yet the king will be at the head of the army on mazarin s side   17.54400067311548
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme   17.350126791257757
certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others   12.180426013254047
has the host told you nothing then   11.666231621349672
said milady   22.830478450546902
the pavilion chapter xxv   14.627671856293384
yes indeed said porthos   6.096324486607103
family joys have no charm for me   17.959779886826873
what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly concealed   13.31604895245829
then it is not justice which is pursuing me   9.72627443919048
porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly and shuddered when he felt the knee of the procurator s wife under the table as it came in search of his   9.505991444668712
the major drew himself up to his full height   12.840883117002559
d artagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for porthos but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it he consented that porthos should share his couch with him   11.567892632887535
that would boom the market   18.191403919691002
what have you discovered   11.403527131043557
a similar signal replied to him   10.515807568457424
near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands   5.825040748098621
said debray to franz   12.606942129355629
mr   8.301442345154054
but i carry your word with me do i not   11.108818844701872
i hastened to the innkeeper   9.944341115290765
listen valentine   21.554688781936967
a few moments passed   13.614314746095298
my god said she what a senseless fanatic   9.772108657583987
said milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to destroy   10.418672561371023
don t stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet   10.935531213528554
they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day   16.223534547084554
i have brought him up   12.276921957073965
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper   9.011163755406333
and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission i will find you a better at enghien at fontenay aux roses or at bellevue   18.01333718957109
you are inclining toward false doctrines my young friend   16.816432044123268
you wish it you are inflexible   9.785455117012553
oh said andrea my father s old servant   8.977909688983889
and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris   11.447815543964271
begin with his father if you please   13.368294918115875
you ought i say then to husband the means you have however large the sum may be   7.7287879136921775
no wounded his horse only   12.04971375613614
the count had just pulled the silken check string which was fastened to ali s finger   15.613453088115033
you have read the letter   11.718499294322847
reflect and decide   12.805119810980832
my dear friend you are going to spoil everything everything is going on famously   9.25160170990265
if it be not an indelicate question resumed d artagnan have you grown rich   12.437906224216672
at nine o clock tomorrow rita s father will be here with the money   12.96688048840209
she was very pale   15.480172953474668
you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural   11.184447681676609
i hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our music paper   16.388394613119043
all was dark   9.389110006070094
well in that case we can manage famously said d artagnan   8.413216956371249
noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying   13.667579190916568
but if he does not come   14.504772334507468
for no one knew that edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept it   9.355876730613673
as he entered the chamber of his friend dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view   2.3418727443048404
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud   10.210789809561454
but like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure   17.214834196171196
exclaimed dantès in grief stricken tones   6.406016718300983
stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed   10.550200332241907
but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head   13.270411298154498
meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours   16.514731129126822
40134m yes since i bring you your two hundred francs   17.936540982236874
do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us   10.802709751171493
gutenberg   9.57417819688605
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead   12.133386783724179
but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain   5.735234688922437
you will appear at this ball   11.035229062918017
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword   6.054127849411294
ah i can understand that   15.953635538861747
now begone said the count pointing to the window   12.905618010422122
i found myself again in complete darkness   14.913711150472256
go then sir and god keep you   17.583676387801624
the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud who turned away his head   12.14955218684773
and eugénie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise d armilly   12.03162447393027
are you a surgeon   7.21372112050656
alas yes said porthos it is so   16.437485663884175
then turning to grimaud he said and thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me   21.899768097124234
but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him   16.909381137444658
the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls   12.556992869674328
sheathe then if you please and follow us   14.865030461365972
a man who has pursued her a long time   7.931612940466371
when he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head   4.18442105039861
this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months   6.2352111156729055
your hand dantès   14.085743178195038
i do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her   12.642579700884221
the position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his difficulties   9.849713033429131
thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dantès had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared   12.928679503663664
and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef   15.497955922020084
but i know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you   13.524600906790853
said the same voice in the same commanding tone   6.092373821582266
is it not a curious affair   8.941154021337368
the law chapter 100   7.143925243359885
asked villefort rushing from his room   13.545866864199022
raoul had offered some opposition at first   11.107568079959597
thanks monsieur said monte cristo   20.57707280549016
if i bore my proper title i should be a lord   1.682951287862691
then arousing from his reverie now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you   11.908025136524099
as things are turning out i foresee that we must give battle to london to the provinces to all england and certainly in the end we can t fail to be beaten   8.251617593570334
noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing   10.414776709128509
to my great regret mordieu   15.779464337802228
i will be there   19.678972345571975
in 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal i received a letter from athos   9.041626393848416
i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars   15.187469325464548
he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him   15.503544795366913
as to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an assortment of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary tools   9.07964529683688
d artagnan porthos and aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords   12.8970593459528
i do not know i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells   8.355512623196162
i can see in the dark   8.861434099200602
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon   15.345852940597801
have you been to the general   13.695591962527654
the count from the moment of first entering the drawing room had not once lost sight of the expression of the young man s countenance   12.184214484258955
have the goodness to send mine to athos s residence   10.903773029538181
do you suffer much   12.568499817314068
on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable wife   12.823651916284888
said d artagnan   16.400180353158685
employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads   14.608348347405467
and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock   16.53179691604331
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge   11.894709971322417
i am lost   5.07387420486694
there is one comfort we are all in cash said d artagnan   17.495322542750735
some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation   14.66241039308566
i think you re right answered he we shall have a gale   11.019606135827472
i do not know particulars   10.193771976873423
but i do not think it is his right one   14.673865610908967
i do not see morrel   14.083734064440115
on the ground floor dining room two drawing rooms billiard room staircase in the hall and a little back staircase   14.218945546623939
i ve ten guards behind me don t you hear them gallop   2.4657519779312693
he then set himself to work to count his fortune   9.676567448074469
the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate   16.846540345050165
and paris   12.748214523978143
for look the sentinels are being reinforced   5.848049587999414
it was not i who made that promise cried morcerf   20.540348595266344
a little said mazarin trembling lest anne should ask to draw upon his purse   9.970461724451102
the discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous   10.554257993495707
the proof of which is that i have fixed upon you to escort me   13.90574942669149
burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words   10.492965917457685
her beautiful face was distorted with agony   7.4638902400171165
give him a lesson debray   17.535985271363998
athos invited d artagnan to follow them   14.670064339453377
you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring   14.781087408272562
the unknown chapter 26   6.309303127737064
he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master   10.082267691804791
danglars opened his bewildered eyes   15.719593002270992
perhaps he never came here or if he did cæsar borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as i have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing   4.064988972409486
they threw themselves upon me   14.8888290553795
i gave the custom house officers a copy of our bill of lading   13.391270525689052
but gentlemen in all this said d artagnan we do not think of the queen   17.327992984838108
cried aramis pale with anger suspecting that d artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with madame de longueville   11.409057951822428
everyone looked at his neighbor   9.625114097745895
and you have come here with that purpose   18.826683321165742
allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside   17.097830296462433
it was you who were behind my bed curtains that night the parisians wished to see me asleep   17.337753892592325
i only suppose so   12.94353954561986
i said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the duc de beaufort who called for help   15.448089463208905
gendarmes said the president lead in the accused   11.522188053598912
no no   16.137276544586367
at this movement which nobody opposed he resumed a little courage and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other   6.31482545731625
and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us   12.356556602792146
asked athos   10.522456233028267
my poor mother   9.70979570325109
do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful   17.41872508065073
monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it   14.426466205016544
in prison   13.257835685953408
capital   13.9115715308759
you know it was agreed you should put in there   16.586735893621707
a woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her presence   10.86362026080368
long live the queen   6.03630447247181
oh   8.693912870638073
aramis   9.319292044729831
we shall return to them unless mazarin razes them to the ground   4.273759731117259
the slave respectfully signalized that he had   10.678443711446622
why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other   4.0893537077918225
by the way said bazin where was he carried   17.62644706702099
d artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day milady gave him a more gracious reception   12.495973791120313
he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols   2.1951007415130093
what an appetite you used to have   9.663053864880396
he made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream   10.291901871639949
armed to the teeth   8.630812980193607
render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritorious   10.348772447564102
ah if you speak in that way said athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask   16.59009918392323
carriages now arrived in crowds   8.625395703402116
the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step   10.147491708456341
who am i   15.76139689616012
may you not have been philandering a little also monsieur bonacieux   9.991211456755364
as for patience you have abundantly proved yours you shall now see me prove mine   11.774732252513633
on perceiving monte cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love   11.554413956580234
my lord said d artagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i can not miss   16.972341538009214
these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon   4.154979349189331
as one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a dog   16.550440366140073
on my honor   14.018565124401423
repeated a voice behind the count and why   12.78013415597424
you see i do not conceal myself   3.339644678665975
arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar sausages   15.639001988584873
i only repeat what i have been told and like my informant i can do no more   16.695914213550136
what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not   13.458872448993981
dantès made a gesture   15.890831492377583
will you name him   15.4288035757057
the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker   6.061964225228622
it appears so sir replied monte cristo   11.29728858522163
for instance that henri iv   16.72324855526736
40100m no   13.44519100189599
many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me   12.634582552018019
and an inquest in my house impossible   16.449233587660494
ah   9.934747505207921
where has the favorite gone   5.376693353766217
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts   3.8377962270509176
but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example   18.7800292765925
what is the matter   10.824654082391294
and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess   5.753910370396105
i will give you the signal   15.19424730190242
my children two of them at least the duke of york and the princess elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes   11.264628420437326
madame de villefort was dead   15.440240022735
no no   14.013610958359914
0209m since my imprisonment said faria i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record   4.6455358893513115
you must know all your officers i mean those more distinguished   8.4191073989218
i have measured them   13.749111675610658
de villefort that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed the feeling of m   13.012688132002378
try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without interruption   13.527165707023432
barrois said the doctor can you speak   14.911724878847133
once again silence   13.533345552600077
since my misfortunes i have been subject to faintnesses which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver   21.228213968280073
athos shuddered and turned pale   11.302295138625063
but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses ah   12.048929015379167
now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person   20.611718852723648
the escort divided into two files   15.23379624331216
unhappy man   3.49823945738979
and what a strange air for a victor   16.754793217817117
adieu sir she said   12.153579387672226
i don t speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin   11.706951107155668
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water   16.259230859199032
yes and up to this point i know all said the priest   17.225418443070268
but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment   20.82826579342356
the foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back   13.036558446332819
for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it   15.299454458764853
then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had done the guilty deed   10.889694041274874
asked porthos   13.061105157773461
i have no enmity against m   13.985801640382615
porthos looked at the bottle which was near him and hoped that with wine bread and cheese he might make a dinner   12.271052569523482
the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage   21.822084508674713
milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs   13.572962051726615
you would not fight a duel   28.360789258733767
no nothing at all   2.2680881157843142
ah yes i know   13.78771402630311
no no by no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground   15.643248967247096
my lord he said which way do we go   10.255167131515607
barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness   2.9544454520037124
i think nothing   14.07204066718694
it is impossible said the procureur   12.68381493442536
the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards   10.48213041608206
at last we are off   4.524748049152685
then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one   10.658812937776002
some manfred some lara some werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society   16.17959112508576
capital answered the mendicant   11.901905918900551
i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste   18.38908444937982
alone in the world i had but my son and he has left me   14.505053993524662
nachrichter as say our neighbors the germans   10.402337665936127
go then and set about this work in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance   18.569610641762043
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed   12.804387103668732
demanded the chief   11.897590049879469
but still to speak to a man even though mute was something   15.768910093449477
had they been actuated equally by courage the one would have done great things for the other   14.581620006915077
for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then i should have been free   14.006554795416061
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son   9.314796185393504
the queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to de winter if you need money my lord separate the jewels i have given you   9.099888679136534
you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship   10.61317072977145
we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives   10.287612460492179
and for a captain s commission i would not write it   9.406467675449601
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life   11.432080574786015
asked he   13.147967813494734
monseigneur replied athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him monseigneur the musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys   13.389231422766233
yes   13.166575930885006
oh   7.035432848000224
and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass   15.082490849275265
the young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground   11.884004767473225
and this is called in human tongues as i tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy   9.463661493772904
she was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky   9.951924874520302
i do not know her name   9.354204396115387
franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce   14.687127915487983
rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the church his costume being similar to that of the abbés in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet   12.337948845677248
in the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them   15.283576482668636
in this garden mercédès had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty four years previously   5.848136374640987
for everything   7.141835722670905
there is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the frondeurs   13.67209515302344
we all know that interrupted the king   10.213967574480538
it is there you are to take up your quarters   19.714354956067993
the invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until to morrow morning   18.276016281319535
who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies   18.621424764139796
as a proof remember the date of the day on which i had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night   12.597279613613235
then on the honor of a mazarin as i am and ever shall be i hope said the cardinal   18.54087628894608
yes   10.375464851259531
my faith said d artagnan to athos you had a triumphant idea   11.578307263114926
and if i am taken i will swallow it   9.254419662773913
but tell me my dear lucien what it is that constitutes a princess   8.942535561564757
we haven t known him so long   6.613938060212713
the game at tennis which upon a sign from grimaud monsieur de beaufort had consented to play began in the afternoon   17.882901009633915
he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself   12.91447979324818
still said château renaud dr   13.197526697176354
but how   8.560795887161182
the matter had been named to him by d artagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the danger   15.419801595004818
she was my mother   14.442815242060059
a lesson   16.667033587429685
yes sir returned julie   15.526888944599166
madame coquenard said porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which i preserve engraved in my memory   14.507646174689256
never mind said milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper   5.805573467233774
it was impossible that his best friend if indeed he had any friend left could recognize him   9.564293791145563
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres   13.995741985727669
he has put out the lamp i can see nothing now   12.514152210383712
the following morning with the banker s usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man s hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for caderousse   10.33239937324984
it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared   5.850096100731869
they threw themselves into each other s arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the house   16.547235861421626
albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble   13.088721967878678
besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them   17.8444642395876
again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him   10.179695882388556
what time is it then   11.745932085429738
then the demigod vanished   18.678206738767923
albert was used to the count s manner of proceeding   12.14600551742028
this last reason appeared convincing   18.145470044379987
franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex   13.8714806494182
on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the parisian troops ran to him   14.997791967057474
lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all   16.03948040316082
what   4.192817282140798
the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs   8.448363138412539
i know nothing for certain   14.063308230092128
d artagnan took the letter touched his hat with his hand turned round upon his heel like a drill sergeant and a moment afterward was heard in his dry and monotonous tone commanding four men and an escort a carriage and a horse   6.804947471665357
replied dantès   11.433238747520946
bah you are wrong   20.21610424804923
tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul   19.656028590273866
merri st   12.908072247263112
his house has been full ever since   0.45869638776345134
you do not belong to the human species   13.3306877304282
on this assurance the two friends fell asleep   17.23338509870587
when they arrived at the madeleine since we are out said beauchamp let us call on m   13.599298525655685
the second to go to the charge no faster than a walk   13.453289735772831
bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king   15.811277882989643
why he pleases me in spite of franz d épinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world   1.7764985956578112
as d artagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith   11.10291162430077
you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing   11.620833032605825
such a beautiful woman   15.496114409742944
on the contrary observed d artagnan with a vexed look   7.118564318266934
no   13.119537566286148
d artagnan looked and was seized with pleasure   12.124520345139992
then the inconvenience became distress   9.527178817264433
yes   13.153682685078728
no sing it please   14.163207049893714
in all probability we shall never see him   8.270900262291654
he will hurt himself with all his ill chosen barbarisms let him go home and go to sleep   17.81091210268967
yes to escort him into the capital   8.30333980485446
said d artagnan pressing athos s hand   15.941914596391596
in a pate for example   10.061123268394313
and on the contrary i think i have not proved myself worthy of your goodness   13.715169597830865
the commission might well be called delicate   19.232955666595668
ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us   10.971874278267293
i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you   7.733168859816778
captivity the first day chapter liii   25.516476952761202
i feel my life fast ebbing   16.811234681726376
said julie   14.165546903601989
when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning   9.262412727999473
is it not true antoine   4.203269467114876
j   17.627647048975533
and do you know this gentleman monsieur   15.666557079656409
do you hear how they sleep   12.85143870582379
he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things   16.1381300467508
a nice acquaintance my friend   8.699020577642766
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there   7.711235779232959
de winter only replied by a groan   18.712169544150058
20175m without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count   12.40352072576113
threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocket money he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel boxes   4.951564854190437
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room   25.018205977048886
he turned up a king   21.253752993534693
and to which   10.839317082695418
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky   11.948771257571265
felton let me die   11.20400223434246
all have forgiven me some have even loved me   8.119304993057902
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half   11.907743613322289
i will see her d artagnan   11.669449830587721
said the inspector   12.757027291250806
replied he   16.236495429391688
these can not be for us said athos   13.055572425672459
the nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them   7.787653522083436
then striking his forehead he exclaimed oh   1.1199506869012872
you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled   6.32485011116204
au revoir   10.841212071492645
i never lose a note of this opera if i can avoid it   22.57453707612578
why you killed him   11.508930016821097
are on either side of the gate which you see there   14.47473431554716
can it be can it possibly be the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina hey   13.270083431482545
i believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty sire   14.499832231499218
marshal de grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to vendin leaving the duc de chatillon to await and bring on the rest   16.989983457423307
well   16.596871166391107
shall i see you again   26.909463313863146
leave us germain said villefort   15.214182176182138
i am ready   8.23237673827896
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you   10.821873018814768
ah   19.697569505543928
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another   6.408895368169923
said château renaud   18.489957098732454
cried franz whose hair stood on end   19.13576197926941
with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence   14.964694606884022
not the least in the world   6.8736989412468725
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced   12.709623691368765
felton was hers   13.721098765579706
the roll call continued   23.379266471595102
you are questioning me like a king s attorney   10.935692740508403
m   9.59259887339036
london   16.329178599159214
but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming   8.418333221444616
had i ten yaninas in my family i should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times   13.90059467301803
and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad   11.754288605091132
athos was then sent to the cardinal   13.5058129933653
50145m you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven   18.133011871726744
then cries of men who were knocked down were heard   16.70407172942073
have me arrested on the part of the queen said he and i i will appeal to his eminence   8.126391327760807
thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her   12.066934785530854
asked gondy   12.615299580890213
what planchet is monsieur d artagnan here   16.03150613024689
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman   14.299805264269265
cried d artagnan   13.484455237821718
i have but now left a house where death has just entered to run to you   11.76707735296738
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing   14.872280623832923
and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors   11.111950051450286
i confess i began to be very uneasy on your account   10.960407358158749
danglars withdrew   18.201976310960948
at the end of that time i shall come and say to you the assertion is false and i retract it or the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please   18.19922000787159
he will gain himself a reputation   7.770113372419335
begone then on your part and i will depart as quickly on mine   13.701961312003096
wrapped in this sweet idea d artagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment   16.538448244902376
ah you are laughing at me   13.651440939346868
when caderousse turned around he saw behind him la carconte paler and trembling more than ever   7.173408756499524
once sir when i was grafting a rose tree   8.751777290897973
d artagnan was conqueror without much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for form s sake   4.852405782686742
franz is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told   13.98822894112082
said he   19.428307561651142
exclaimed d artagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or position does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier   11.051439396636358
what are you saying to her   10.76887943112427
the two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable   15.22339467614345
has he eaten anything lately   17.502700197295376
morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o clock and to bring emmanuel   12.339200245632735
lost beyond redemption   12.11272733324053
i vow i should consider it a profanation   18.90254490700025
yes we will wait replied valentine who revived at these words   10.34125358713552
no no dear d artagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis aramis   18.53969062232968
for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast   14.90863811749294
you will oblige me   10.430993981221611
you had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death   3.433224217607407
murmured milady in extreme terror   5.504995757849843
then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and d artagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what i should say to it   15.515139853559932
take this pen and paper and write what i dictate   11.225393350373341
yes her majesty the queen rochefort smiled contemptuously   8.967423060539502
yes indeed said he i believe so   13.443700733422684
you don t think of holding out against a whole regiment do you   23.209606790707063
have you not slept   12.94649999923949
they would have found they have not found   21.545250633756314
yes in truth yes answered the young lady turning very red i do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle   15.220725540013527
will your eminence please read and examine   14.147326778159904
they think of me in their pleasures as i thought of them in my troubles   12.236140700065928
benedetto will be punished   8.729065466961204
tell me did he put all these questions to you   15.083623091165585
near them were saddles and bridles   8.842201229601557
the sight is hideous   14.89750744664385
gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz   9.68043266408668
ah i confess your excellency when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle i felt my eyes filled with tears   11.53032248026494
i wish to consult you on this passage molli fugiens anhelitu you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf   12.780664352927012
you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign   8.388324700450934
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately   12.886339366511779
anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy   10.710307092482884
wait here ten minutes said m   15.386743997090951
yes happy as myself said he   9.141317078180311
she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped   9.552369207642613
in each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses   21.17664591777463
while he was speaking albert had heard the report of two or three pistol shots   13.143794356927012
then i shall place myself at the cardinal s door a door with glass windows   19.60718739021553
then it seems i am to eat alone remarked the jeweller   13.564795803459788
one evening i went according to custom to a house which i frequented with much pleasure when one is young what can be expected   13.428254267662972
yes he has not much to complain of   12.193824308976891
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter   8.369607708779087
no   17.183983518782867
baron danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate   12.82004720550142
i am an ungrateful fellow   4.05198617744097
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair   10.368466650693017
ah my head   9.02666702597901
the striking points of his face were effaced   12.407437132859242
come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends   18.696091092059685
indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration   16.09147415073216
but to suffer for him is happiness   15.33544463651128
sometimes their play degenerated into battles and in these battles the king was not always the stronger   14.960692380638152
your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are   8.857738753397904
in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other   9.003978096536263
i shall look like some retired baker   15.621954905427407
during this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease   11.574641271902152
the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth   0.7488664119024389
but if your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her   3.1155325450337514
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner   12.087918923582887
monseigneur is correctly informed said d artagnan   8.986440675413895
we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post   13.645387701808508
you were seated upon cushions in the spanish fashion   10.417941175750787

there was an impressive silence   15.06122333376065
pardon me my god   10.394457756893116
said he   15.174240847390468

the lady with the red cushion produced a great effect for she was very handsome upon the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded   20.20432340972026
has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep   13.322217834339733
fortune has been kind to you then   12.431717922475253
then said she he has well played his part   9.295569046915274
about that time   18.601345840109182
that comforts me a little   16.63110765271599
said he to the young man who since the death of buckingham had regained that coolness and self possession which never after abandoned him wretch   14.031433581865283
i do not understand you baron said morcerf   8.098617938435126
order whatever you like for supper the only thing i specify is one of those pies   7.071436400956539
if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened   12.678393425294248
now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him   8.599293917694435
ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion   4.7236140696283
what do you mean   9.128591427445553
danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon   13.135419703227628
oh but i said anne i also duke have had presentiments   13.793940034997151
they then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants   8.469431137812897
bad replied athos very bad   12.606446421929023
and tomorrow to the wheel to the gallows   12.623227707210361
i have an idea about them   9.886657083985753
and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles villefort was introduced   2.347686479021487
oh heavens   17.87550526036357
and heaven knows there are hills enough between rome and florence by the way of aquapendente   21.566859169728588
villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study   16.904008200975134
responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth   8.362897749648997
i did not come to rome to see said danglars aloud   16.389474441285838
i have accustomed myself to regard you as my son well then to save my son i will sacrifice my life nay even my fortune   19.017637009433006
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantès where he was   9.078610366755273
anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends   9.289570851785177
the boat they were in could not make a long voyage   7.192265958614716
well   17.571036792784792
chapter lxxxvi   12.667067912407948
winter then left the tent   9.304682684519609
asked andrea   13.920341917228427
caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abbé said can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself   5.3354099213901245
well i will immediately call on m   2.3403481541527373
my friend said beauchamp in the most affectionate tone i should gladly make an apology   5.310424219186127
and they went out together   13.844686357326964
what   6.144357225531369
it was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion   15.411181867524084
yes madame replied the officer   11.460663378013766
if beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will the satisfaction to you will be the same   7.436680157997956
cries of death   13.032018344218386
he has become an abbé that is all   9.534955004127097
and if the fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the fronde must triumph   7.570697728390522
formerly i was your junior by two or three years and if i am not mistaken i am turned forty years old   8.135935176469182
therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion   13.114923520273791
those two words your mass and a simple glance cast upon felton revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make   11.050050216876189
when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost   13.31143500456577
exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure   12.254156533624272
cried felton   15.022687907856213
you are right mr   7.753511639413034
i must reach compiègne tonight or i shall cause deep anxiety to my family   15.912230463440402
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states   5.899928425033186
it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution   7.643809495215968
i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man   7.602660263480102
ali is the supper ready   12.127973135088439
why one of them is a rich lord from touraine and the other a knight of malta of noble family   10.572008548404458
but take away the young man   17.014506490960706
there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count   6.793083916752899
i will obey your orders my lord   9.6343648416708
20027m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose   14.517652514732935
should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and i must do my duty   12.978681501619928
ah bah   15.05351104399751
ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of love you see he has not forgotten me for here he is   10.908740228808892
they did not kill her and that s a comfort   12.01736260102685
i own myself conquered   11.627141896363522
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary   16.8048508565941
that will do   11.192762236030706
because the fifth is dead as i hear   8.11872592905899
it would have been remarkable   13.414699104393222
we have accomplished more difficult things than that   9.72094783873303
i tell you i am going to die do you understand   15.073059251417906
anne had never at the louvre had so large a court   18.11057876575964
well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object   8.577918809742862
then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save   15.508460532739948
i had three similar ones returned monte cristo   13.318055229106596
women are very indiscreet my sister   18.86418242119194
my father had a long white beard but i loved him   13.614608108846731
at the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoner s brains with a pistol shot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the account   13.897355276030565
besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces   12.45912741006219
will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hôtel of the duc de la trémouille and that they did not endeavor to burn it   2.8120137972758297
this was the room appropriated to the sailors   13.640471700046037
then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt   16.517830012937115
there was profound silence   12.833161587717099
of lofty stature   15.790317271969746
be assured i will return the favor hereafter   11.85117261993342
inquired faria   9.47547171385
in the eyes of many benedetto appeared if not a victim to at least an instance of the fallibility of the law   10.644651659673796
exclaimed mazarin   16.514855587632468
it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp   9.293838378016012
you know that very well as i gave my order to saddle my horse   8.26943232415822
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity   17.788420006440504
take care returned albert   16.418090129595882
but say out all you think d artagnan for you have not yet done so   17.654590665021374
no no look look   16.766592850634
they breakfasted in haste and at six o clock had already gone ten miles   13.237146219548237
the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside her   12.929620110743985
he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be considered   11.553806701901419
at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid   20.42809881554475
i fancy i must have mended that skull somewhere or other   13.345866657403219
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion   11.854736223365109
but said franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscount   15.491190821145274

the cardinal s   5.872116258486079
you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your son challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live   14.773517530509086
about eleven o clock in the morning they perceived amiens and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn   15.91624771687194
go then and find them   3.649052291355458
i have one but not one from cardinal mazarin   10.19288269822282
very true replied the gascon but i always run away from compliments   8.38510714778559
for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind   7.728175805643766
a doctor   9.831527785841075
yes yes to mine   0.6274252641706362

go and see cocles and if my father is there announce this gentleman   15.56554756042973
the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times   12.71597700737337
why   12.616359418486912
repeat your story saint laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the tale   15.522797517302225
still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i can not explain to you   14.965617736697
and now   14.091916741369843
this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in one syllable verse which i began yonder   9.262662289797616
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him   13.08043765588109
what are you waiting for   14.962527652599302
said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required   7.64670108366869
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock   13.317101556224443

said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door   11.429711561169402
but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury   9.552694970320406

if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven o clock the count albert will have ceased to live   9.795545480591937
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first time   14.958556806854942
the three young people were talking together   7.8211971996893705
for i begin to suffer again   10.426848390790262
the sweat rolled from her brow   10.87930155757049
in all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family   19.44498709663568
cried franz   8.414661328654642

every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm   11.349716813023239
what is the amount   12.051586079241087
what would you not have accomplished if you had been free   23.131138540440045
these important advantages d artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe   13.084188157310614
noirtier may be right   12.479973299467618
bertuccio   14.41873368930672

i was called to see him on his dying bed that i might administer to him the consolations of religion   2.2376721295363993
cried dantès joyfully   13.61434720754053
she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days   6.665309740918092
he came from marseilles where he had been deputy procureur   9.23202543854067
one alone is left to me but he is one of those known i believe to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak   6.944962928338737
this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office   11.075759131417698
i admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady   11.444021033156176
her self control however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm   12.177084319729696
yes   12.744826380103634
i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else   10.836452004079312

the four or five remaining hours before nine o clock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visits designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker s in their gayest equipages dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative   14.368590037462385
but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you do not speak a single word do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant   5.741315116856624
you   9.813522242015763

she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world   7.61897817996753
the walls were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the dead   14.707846072705136
a horse is mortal   11.377488421412071
and d artagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a sensation   7.801434752329659

ah my dear sir you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person   14.95797145297231
the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dantès mind   9.584934300650389
now mousqueton he said i hope you don t mean to desert your master   4.610576735086386
cried scarron i should compromise you too much   4.208260723493687
said d artagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in gold   17.17426820988713

but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them   14.169483567035703
your pardon sir said milady with mildness   6.992397074224282
his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness   0.8154445026736159
diamond   11.415606148877073
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word   8.274885500429336
at that moment d artagnan opened his eyes   17.704080510424692
now you have the key of the cellar   10.809777057231583
said d artagnan   16.869900799423988
and i said tréville coldly i have some pretty things to tell your majesty concerning these gownsmen   13.89393733573024
who   10.56904509030308
these announced the arrival of the queen   12.963344134891898
he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight   22.33329658381091
my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but misfortune   12.875700686757861
so young said albert forgetting at the moment the count s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name   12.656981152462647
and let me give you a piece of advice   13.824760819531535
you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning   16.794642777005734
the result was that to prevent mm   7.342154400875577
six o clock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven o clock dinner was ready and served up   15.438629786731493
molière had not written his scene in l avare then   4.873382987824587
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done   16.661637651846345
they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it   22.028024517909962
tis not his voice   13.43047998140704
the queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing raoul again and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche   12.196371931856111
do you understand what i mean   4.953103108750454
it must be worth one s while to stoop andrea when that good m   7.862015388385331
who made the lemonade   16.03631184612443
cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us   9.02715845213519
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her   11.47121628549116
he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber   5.011648930359351
the appetite grows by what it feeds on said caderousse grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling   6.212377662025267
danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere   8.13690770839053
that is forbidden me said grimaud until the last moment   9.910609513811227
aramis   7.130745984978361
impossible   8.621476200521318
come in my host   11.430962308901771
yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards   16.05828477199805
then your means it appears are improved   8.431925768320742
cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion   18.46829304497479
to whom do you desire to leave this fortune   12.727929586827665
everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination   10.125369358506692
how long must you have served to claim the pension   7.253452496413924
and then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess   19.4723165757801
f   17.43571441685541
i am going that i may not bring fresh trouble into your family and to set an example which every honest and devoted man situated as i am may follow   3.0440379448244297
have you seen anything   14.031645262934635
then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables   8.079753750639963
no not precisely   12.899584056002842
he is at marseilles   10.47197424518027
i will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he doesn t speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away   17.496933403055333
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women   19.052531021066784
ah but what is the matter with your hand d artagnan   18.521033131666904
are you not aware that we are never seen one without the others and that we are called among the musketeers and the guards at court and in the city athos porthos and aramis or the three inseparables   8.579656992411314
said caderousse   17.60297511465256
for what purpose   10.777768566939795
that s true said m   10.400552742924873
but i have none   3.4380150200207247
he resembles the old conventionalist of 93 who said to napoleon in 1814 you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth   0.9276415839304306
well   14.186543530103679
milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will   6.534008674632415
go on   15.27790745544325
you are in constant communication with the baron danglars   11.89796092554783
listen to me   12.023452725458265
athos reflected for an instant   11.857379302618584
milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup overflow   9.945031710275837
it seems to me said the host that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur   10.38541666373012
peter s successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues   17.840508019271155
ah indeed   7.829791860355851
no nonsense my good fellow   10.977124756756147
will these be in your way   15.625159888967797
that doubles the offense said porthos disengaging his arm from that of the procurator s wife   17.854530098805107
the count listened and said no more   14.196667001739703
the soldiers were playing or sleeping   12.56534049331359
to no one   15.501209208352199
your affair is not bad said athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good   22.338499156650833
he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed   8.11637643662922
you said only imagine and then paused   17.945382251347166
the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite   15.514567725130075
five thousand francs   16.340030563582225
at last after crossing the courts of the palais royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate   10.935135525972155
it was a coupé of koller s building and with horses and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas   5.207443573080409
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look   4.131093108974261
his three companions joined him   13.78777127402947
after a moment s silence the lady inquired do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium   12.78009887108398
is it not unjust shamefully unjust   20.25076334647607
when i am convinced that the statement is false   10.37582735564581
but for me alone this is good enough   6.772134543905341
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section 4 information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation   12.067309063132774
i have but you in the world haydée   17.679077755190725
my dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent   16.602946585181595
counting his treasures replied the governor   11.063887649714841
and these researches   17.883886637019543
my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them   5.329368928542197
thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile   14.648106511414527
franz d épinay a delightful travelling companion with whom i made the tour of italy   10.250516513835649
a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared immediately   9.104468714685954
the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him   7.120905839859416
well i shall write to the abbé   13.566320588018797
cried felton oh pardon   11.82169942869211
i think he has not been arrested and as i am his wife s confessor if she knows where he is i shall know it too   11.8087242427307
now after what you told me this morning of your heart i may believe well count replied morrel gayly i will not dispute it   10.766003212326961
they stopped at the sign of the fox in the rue du vieux colombier a tavern known for many years by athos and asked for two bedrooms   23.025067077748645
i have said what i have said   21.067794081912396
how   11.031295456005381
does he still live   6.633365711156648
the young woman continued to advance   10.344544112639241
they drew near to the sloop   10.483726912100787
they quickly went downstairs   10.407864606586912
which you answer according to your fancy replied mazarin   20.93420610633524
he also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible montreuil the terror of all expert palates   12.984089868962705
franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion   8.660799302052574
there s only the price we are not agreed about   11.549535502901632
edward cried m   12.937503423111705
and the man   15.020358109617533
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down   10.578386706744677
bernouin entered   21.501111292514786
oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and i know you   19.733502182104303
and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it   21.931766057173995
of what consequence   12.361276131589293
the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his eminence   12.577217931837549
thank you sir said d avrigny   10.934102582525082
his next care on leaving the barber s who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor s suit a garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap   11.038269892470122
that is all i can say to you   14.990543140901238
noirtier again closed his eyes   16.92927954053941
but is the matter certain   13.326621462911897
i was looking anxiously for some iris roots i planted here close to this reservoir and which some one has trampled upon this morning   10.096890791118522
hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of you   8.371235616227693
then we shall pay the more that s all i see plainly enough   11.716020974979294
because she was afraid of compromising you   8.43209444581578
in that case said d artagnan i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence   10.433763730365182
what reason do you assign   13.493884587744152
d artagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him   14.610906365296566
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle   15.570743743501337
de monte cristo whom you just saw leaving here you did see him i think   8.57972017209299
no this is his blood   10.043530380174948
besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture   11.979843969699873
certainly your excellency   5.6717156725638755
mazarin coughed a little   15.518191714156632
to yours monsieur   15.257721073779443
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch   9.709965578604452
but we were not captured by fair means   13.386370323369855
said porthos   14.453377433079165
my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friend s arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen s service   18.103819651793707
that is better said the gascon   10.118020575513222
i shall adore god sir said raoul respect royalty and ever serve the king   22.781051696564646
arrest the prime minister of king charles i   10.839999284724113
at eleven o clock albert had not come back   11.88022115474519
bah   5.7482126051631255
i left half because it seemed so bitter   13.481379305000699
coquenard was served first then porthos   10.427655918425287
yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink beer   7.668869516879055
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand   12.524936285546566
am i to consider this as part of my income on account   11.648356523871938
take away vasiliki   15.535167297386565
well replied athos have you not heard what d artagnan said   17.9605215658833
lord bless us   17.294682503511154
i mean that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me   12.157602734113263
yes since you have such a good memory   9.752021833802669
i do not know my lord   9.308400060525134
why replied dantès i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire   11.010332859809019
how   13.360929202635782
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it   9.58187741422476
in two words you will know all   12.856938397885191
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night   13.227393219787194
having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him   16.516180271021803
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression   16.1735183852212
it was you who took him count said raoul smiling   13.700043079070968
you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hands going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me   11.120979719292288
danglars shuddered   25.28997453055296
no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question   17.301759620735357
zaccone are the same absolutely the same   7.849648423865555
oh my god   16.763958514672904
that s your opinion   12.561071805736406
he stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired   5.081826089560128
and your two other friends   10.039878048203265
felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the prisoner   3.483707807452296
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection   12.116740395382962
in three days i should have been twenty   4.438569895999078
none whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot   11.677939364565564
should you know those doors again   12.38774024790718
and planchet dined by sleeping   8.315331612916529
she was overwhelmed   11.924652845691746
and you know who i am without doubt   8.097469802282586
you wore a close ruff a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe and in that cap a heron s feather   15.375041982943772
she appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal   11.763875768492376
sixteen pioneers four soldiers   14.606584463502838
monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir   7.513161898467161
he paused   10.527981972820387
what could i do for you edmond besides pray and weep   12.595418358358492
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès   10.666763248717828
are you sure   10.11131036415155
de villefort giving the key to d avrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work   4.008146975949632
is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir   15.115833501732467
the abbé d herblay   9.945983246328536
the album said edward sulkily   11.113057251663664
he was polite to me and i was so to him   11.198191744994688
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction   24.532113525855294
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work   6.867539620322315
if not let him become bankrupt for the 250 000 livres and do as all bankrupts do disappear   11.97366657304353
truly this is an indignity   13.359752449472927
a horse for which château renaud offered you four hundred louis and which you would not part with   6.5837241384654
i know it sir   14.92886819222361
but he had gone farther than athos for at the village of festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further   13.214328024407934
exclaimed la ramee   13.942157272273661
on the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then   9.31782099588022
ah indeed said d artagnan   13.121244860467332
certainly they were   9.255050267754408
the return   17.394895717399535
ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels   10.52221370537934
it was late   15.061355698052214
who is this officer inquired raoul of athos who is speaking   16.647935943531408
the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work   19.48782397319088
with such a vade mecum d artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait   8.78362625340466
which interrupted the duchess is now brought up against her as a great crime   19.20861546984526
she cried   14.491629124166087
for before everything i wish to avenge myself   7.055008101283406
it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge   15.977128830430273
and asked the abbé is m   21.299335413580806
what more need be said   22.776527232331368
i have had the honor of informing your eminence that these men were drunk   15.834087256322096
i don t like mazarin any better than you do   8.768753092404085
an event took place in the church of st   7.5532587166301175
if i were a frondeur said d artagnan i should knock here and should be sure of a good supper   12.791930460937108
said he   6.916264281235234
my heart is that of a musketeer   7.6616320582658926
welcome   9.786718184719941
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting   11.521447075712626

m   14.324301154236865
sire i entreat you to do so   7.144332090253075
a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort   7.3902824209196485
this one was dead   10.03516628713958
cried d artagnan beside himself with joy   7.0398736131368125
she opened it quickly and read go this moment to the allées de meilhan enter the house no   9.336447292365337
de monte cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family   8.290298176679197
and in fact they went away quite proud and happy   14.994256775217728
i love you also you   19.138520158127744
patience monseigneur we are coming to it   10.304455182652484
did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before   16.71165741376153
without revealing himself   13.94784807601102
asked the young girl   19.729934889670382
he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired   15.98272834230606
what my own feeling is you already know   14.804944333361505
but when i reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman   18.139696951037813

now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not   15.823355225273461
probably if ever i get out of prison   3.8256987052797324
i hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else i warn you i will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion   13.67992959905726
therefore she knew him   20.2827756370324
he knew her well enough in all cases to know that whether acting for or against him as a friend or an enemy she would not remain motionless without great impediments   8.66332436357282
she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her   13.399925899090155
you would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald green sea   8.211645884632677
for you and your comrades   7.529759710266289
cried d artagnan   12.309358519687905
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti   12.536225031277082
hush   6.032409470599655
said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not over   7.181546030469455

bravo monsieur grimaud   9.06719894620864
the women had already fled taking refuge in vitry   18.03831022082133
alas speak to me more gently father   17.767195505560352
d artagnan s plan was very simple   19.062879402012626
well repeat it repeat it i beg of you that i may at last believe it   12.359177236082262
what   13.872181803298934
i think he tasted them one day   17.01980008697307
they had expected maximilian since the previous evening   15.97065374097177
answered aramis as you see from heaven   13.6478528670035
d artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family   7.6603793559757385
i have taken the whim into my head   17.734117325239154
if beaten i am lost   10.436418017403398
no sir replied monte cristo   18.06997479650621
long live de beaufort   9.982067965783443
and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing   18.735385708025852
in the year 1811 i was transferred to piedmont in france   8.949248279808767

is one friend forbidden to visit another or a musketeer of my company to fraternize with a guard of dessessart s company   10.828969180882659
but let us first sit down to table for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready   13.389972989598308
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles   4.005279451684391
to what do you refer   22.297694189583034
how is that   12.663576573105454
grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so   7.122415602568905
de villefort   13.194756331788822
but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening ah   10.097133453170876
none i swear to you   21.465558425926915
but towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them   12.72089568422062
of course replied danglars   17.124015864544923
thank you sir thank you   13.299641995097435
afterward   15.225797928906953
i think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment   9.845296507276943
while this dialogue was going on the two young men and the poor lackey descended   17.162053244273793
god was still in his heart   19.848685861178545
at two and twenty one calls every man one s friend   4.7346953087934205
mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it   11.560871256099722
his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity   7.74944352632673
exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him   14.474457180287784
he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract   10.472209788618612
however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m   12.678077107649035
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain   11.878149213133847
sir cried the latter am i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house   9.957768065372445
thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen   9.34642650521436

that is agreed upon   17.27283468529175
sign my lord   7.106585592987949
both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard it was full of gunpowder   15.37494443138083
i was chosen   13.111546477343051
it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento   11.402579237086561
patience patience   7.643950034322521

is this carriage for me   20.82349120695278
the doctor had put him on a diet   5.9976015989320635
de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death   15.581831607188215
or his mistress interrupted d artagnan   10.365506210310471
asked d artagnan   15.65001613055803
his servants are all devoted to him   13.3427105379983
they killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summer house overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library   17.36723977824453
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm   14.085864434983211
grimaud remained with his hand extended   10.677439651808118

from my father   15.977235031985952
he thought he heard a sob   8.16726743269346
come my friend said he courage   15.69759128053157
and yet their natural disposition revealed itself   12.582094042351043

i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike   16.121062528867537
my stables are at your command viscount   13.358231056330277
pay no attention to it   13.848150164384439
but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence   3.7284424061246018
egad   9.442140705153351
his deep set eyes were hollow and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face   11.838074960967695
don t you agree with me aramis   17.943151486706817
i did   6.365462684824498
having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to d avrigny and said and now the priest   11.144675805913032
6   9.352430396200546
he was at the louvre with his company   8.581451649256914
and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use   12.743721420084222
it formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is magnificent   7.8890622764385885
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same   1.9591286692571135
shall i speak to him   10.40671553035623
yes sir   18.934191495095153
oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy   17.984086941690308
thank you edmond   17.33368501913709

a moment gentlemen a moment   13.305277927619363
who employed you to assassinate me   18.555131454229215
but how could a dose prepared for m   8.544994197346657
your excellency is safe and sound   8.785540954623361
and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it   10.664397343842218
he said to porthos   11.55133361140258
cried he at length   12.251341453566155
the young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the messenger but he had disappeared   16.88171282675668
it was the king speaking on the scaffold   16.430031252759555

exclaimed danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation   6.434642623750046
gentlemen he continued addressing the cavaliers who became more and more numerous every instant   10.884570316263996
d artagnan returned   6.661460375927522
what is the matter then with this dear child   13.975636548649963
the countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart   8.94567408538824
everything will come to us when wanted   4.380868452131441
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string   13.721204641420297
for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button hole   16.410770375089136
chat between brother and sister during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door close a shutter and draw a chair near to his sister in law s fauteuil milady anxiously thoughtful plunged her glance into the depths of possibility and discovered all the plan of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen   5.026430930799214
oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus   17.221206919798707
but listen   12.356777088574164
proceed   9.486732565894819
what say you franz   6.327514297942977
he knows you better by your actions than your name   6.896240437015201
like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position   13.029086570531948
in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of memory   12.822277380387122
do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their movements   14.07007967474923
i have committed no crime   12.087700542533309
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes   6.964958552094082
nothing easier   14.803160100821046
no it will all go well   10.35980639511463
but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet   13.990546815531914
in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone   13.970498845768919

while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose   12.418869701469749
but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission   17.8216289259011
the day passed away in utter silence night came without recurrence of the noise   10.368517999419375
ali with considerable animation made a sign in the affirmative   14.804108207596226
this portion of the napkin was marked with half a baron s crown and the letter h   16.938392716485364
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived   14.186601915108515
madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles   12.959302583919522
whenever it shall please your majesty   14.398023133059208
why so   6.924094178665682

we every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork and some meat when he asks for it   8.33143149170271
the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre   9.5688946843467
arrived at the end of the lane d artagnan turned to the left   19.292380276320966
well replied the latter blushing what must i say   9.021954987965282
yes   12.359958055326146
in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lord s passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy   17.942670499121014
all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed   14.458802386446823
madame de longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty   8.193154710765672

all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness   13.976261141646184
if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way   7.751934178374459
he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground   10.714804061773897
i was expected at sharp midnight and i am late   13.418421342424802

sir replied olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning   10.5868781931579

monsieur d artagnan sides with mazarin   4.201671466128765
there is none said athos   14.791483426814793
vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks   5.472148223025571
why i paid him   16.283267619999442

a problem my dear count for everyone for my mother as well as others   10.919959357407137
at this moment the door of the dining room unclosed with a creak and porthos perceived through the half open flap the little clerk who not being allowed to take part in the feast ate his dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and kitchen   9.313448906076498
exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail   12.109720248037009
no i do not jest mordieu   12.368158166094169
and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him   14.231816316217564
certainly   15.017628432063896
asked monte cristo carelessly   14.117273104833396
and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you   12.62273865762614
someone was taken in the mousetrap   9.38271093045611
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain   13.085225020200395
he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that i see you nothing more   11.75077041375626
i am   14.176586558032048
an idiot who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income   9.370875095343244
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach   9.693968511130802
notary   9.933046940677661
the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what o clock it was   13.55050581680284
would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him   25.10762349186074
and he set off running as if the devil possessed him hoping that he might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carried him far   8.799328508003201
ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it   6.599060074895565
i was wrong a hundred times wrong   5.433014372707539
we should have heard the blow then   9.516901803533777
the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard   4.487891971307027
d artagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know   13.20832236614463
how should i know   9.570441707517713

follow him said villefort to dantès   9.952316791340156
on seeing the appointed signal groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the gentlemen   15.024693822576877
the lackeys were sent to their several posts except that grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway   11.419438710976314
they reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have been   11.517612833309384
50235m the carriage entered by the porta del popolo turned to the left and stopped at the hôtel d espagne   12.236357204807781
40248m sir said maximilian you are not perhaps aware that i am m   16.452895194493976
i do not think you understand me replied caderousse calmly   8.236903706004956
yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise i can not answer as to what i may do myself   10.745573561713462

pistache my friend jump for the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina   14.777477422623509
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them   8.643640158961894
and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude oh then ask haydée   16.894896834940482
then you can come and dine with me   13.098317898427739
i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection   5.159957708763905
the plot is clever   6.914585663507335
in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose   13.868699778395047
my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper   14.813537576521096
those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames   11.839044248599826
you have some   7.581948704647385
the door keeper was called   7.402500491197619
and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man   13.151168322858453
the soul forms its own horizons   11.522578264019323
ed   14.89639165398197
olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly   5.990528715966982
yes sir   11.678569556311992
but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence   6.72700216040593
there s nothing i wish more replied mazarin   13.295009523184858
near the carmes deschaux   12.972744431159413
god is wearied   13.948425745748954
i am the chevalier de rochefort answered the other the equerry of monsieur le cardinal richelieu and i have orders to conduct you to his eminence   13.04064506574339
have you killed the cardinal   19.938538278267515
i could not have killed her by the same blow i should have fled from my country   14.51711228279976
interrupted tréville   12.440864682922685
bonacieux   16.632448141780863
d artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised   9.47547727294543
no   12.424741508945601
mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him   1.9020329244304168
i placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin   21.94391407619099
how could this ring come into the hands of milady clarik   5.703070300191724
but if i am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint   12.582457835019408
may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences   11.755424997527463
and how proceed   12.276083147606121
the old man winked violently   8.272822389203203
cried the duke you are so good   10.788282200185831
i shall always love you   15.299421497484225
ah monsieur it is silence   14.466217299015373
chapter xi   9.858203037032133
then turning round he perceived fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking song   9.291631816889216
good answered grimaud   8.113406418476785
for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to mazarin as every gentleman ought to be   19.18510444302941
what do you say sire   10.55475632260837
at this moment and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached   2.671328312484265
athos looked at him intently   20.37979042435493
here it is said athos   10.187847514378106
and had it not been for the hostess he added with his air of vulgar self complacency who is very agreeable and understands a joke i should have got a lodging elsewhere   7.218227676617347
unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him   6.250151119566971
0215m you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place   11.974305188179624
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun   16.94967910838463
he took them with him without encouraging them or promising them anything and without concealing from them that their luck and even his own depended upon the cast of the dice   9.75193535882279

but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases   5.988833258017589
well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal   13.506803200419737
and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere   3.7249381357278555
his eminence asks for the letter said bernouin passing back into the ante chamber   8.787723190065382
the others withdrew   7.504048507291068
the four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark   10.467315318288275
this must be then an affair of importance   14.037274964013926
dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what i sabring right and left among the bedouins can have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels   0.4390257729353486
but then he may have stopped at saint germain   19.74322192165277
tis here said athos   8.442215973441172
this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning   14.440713414291707
no repeated noirtier   10.591558453307215
i was four years old   8.792359653631761
i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king   6.48639101536108
well   12.652750771920191

lackeys   1.9903295374282042
indeed   7.600485814621951
to day it s a sort of diplomatic arrangement   14.206611805471702
exclaimed the young couple   14.689622396597276
and you will pay ready money   12.554728766518611
chapter xlvii   7.494113459151537
0023m alas sir in the most unexpected manner   17.935207797817938
for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire   10.467533967589867
or rather i will go for him myself   8.810081147075161
two held poor assunta who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners   11.68406363119215
and you are the person whom m   3.0744534509550157
but that is the history of the hundred days m   14.190913887668781
has this woman been relating her crimes to you   13.94485582433214
you are a prisoner   11.168666659053715
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say   15.645850602966313
in faith tis time you came back again   7.92359474064851
he had stopped like raoul at the hotel of the bell and bottle the best at compiegne   14.472981348000722
he asked coldly   10.673126692654401
qui vive   0.9874950424383666
the whole assembly manifested great surprise but andrea appeared quite unmoved   12.870162116857514
oh man man race of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do i recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves   11.99508413532583
all three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools   6.5076015208199705
but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation   16.684373752411283
but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit   13.904899894492
here said she you see i have thought of everything   15.702768716184247
i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here   10.890071633609013
one may forsake a mistress but a wife good heavens   9.343215037730008
half past seven had sounded   8.043143393725586
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his   25.90377655985791
i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted   11.10050340855543
porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent qualities   14.85954682449509
such was albert s opinion of the count and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it   5.738858975276736
it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman   9.498269156125335
your orders do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten minutes in half an hour or an hour   14.06812628069116
have you it   14.686991014497723
i pledge you my word madam said the abbé that my intentions are good   8.857851520160963
you have not by chance married a protestant for a third husband have you   9.055412966010325
there is not much time lost yet   13.737260259182548
yes my lord replied the servant m   16.075075209325867
and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him   7.4301617156273485
sinbad the sailor   17.25111440174446
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary   9.779688877768056
but why have you not fled   18.188374680893073
thanks replied the jeweller   14.047683728918594
on each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the carmelites who listened to the divine service and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests without seeing the profane or being seen by them   11.66965952414476
lord de winter   10.239549132057231
almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me   14.95663899103038
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too   8.997780771699777
when you have purchased the estate i desire i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road   7.785845269881137
at one of the doors that by which he had entered i placed our scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out again   11.112606317206874
it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life   14.740940952996919
he had walked as one walks in a dream   12.756812261729095
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel   12.402652264438528
so much the better   13.696499704882346
to the boat   14.857868182730137
then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at giglio giannutri or monte cristo   6.079106726329822
but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it   15.116891225074772
m   16.030701681342705
now to supper said aramis   16.194016770248577
this harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort   12.014203304797707
but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a musketeer i wore an enormous cloak said aramis   4.632213329116505
yes sir replied the young man naively   9.910637429724037
the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame   13.165982107945409
for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin   13.870784668413961
i must however first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of life   12.774395328517866
my name is ah   9.062289394411337

from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years   14.68918265927082
no but i heard all   11.459787425560823
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis   13.288993153249535
said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of d artagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds   12.197735952338123
in a second i had disinterred the box   15.798151153833487
where will you begin   16.526548067625754
yes   17.05311645415363
monsieur porthos was six feet high   18.440330983774565
demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo   22.681964988284115
i swear to you again rather than betray you i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces   15.20257144118106
sir said planchet i am in all things at your service   13.150046115890914
presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave   9.358626863019492
from england   9.71285610158295
madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted   7.6193079773371455
where are you running to   9.598517727302559
d artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing   14.630046636359197
send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic   14.645892578518332
which box do you mean   6.020058012751308
m   14.107415415104503
why did she not let me know sooner   10.768092446567985
certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it   16.20315257972484
we dispense with your saying grace   11.928839580239885
does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris   10.827560648616883
cried milady throwing herself at his feet   14.374103954863461
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated   8.702262582306254
d artagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his agility   5.403210307675579
yes   13.026950270007472
come m   12.16315844164473
i have never been understood and no wonder   8.474008448541285
he hastened to open the secrétaire and found the pocket book in the drawer and in it the letter of credit   11.981226347099275
come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you   16.844155533531467
grief does not stun me   11.428887365838088
but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked   7.16081601716498
what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousand livres which he wore on his finger   12.859381108906216
it is indeed   14.750711531883947
i will embrace your knees   8.710076359783722
or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed   8.239246542892891
he understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to rome   8.8791164803803
you have ordered your carriage at eight o clock precisely   13.459478595629559
begone quickly   10.41297931646125
in stuart s room   18.09235290368674
why did you not have yourself conveyed to paris   7.961506235529814
bah replied monte cristo impossible   8.20815397514718
and i clung to life partly on my sister s account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance   12.869829832237583
had you commissioned me   5.299803653695516
and tell the confectioner that i will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his pies not only now but when i leave my prison   7.189728354075036
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly   10.493785036273731
the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention   11.133287888406038
take care i repeat to you take care   9.715903222646023
peste   16.633161102585095
the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest   11.645551809535721
they had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed place   14.763180205323277
farewell   12.522691621541087
and what will that signify to me   23.906100539895483
you excel us all   9.32554896197778
i was going about at random inquiring of everybody when i saw you gallop past   11.100308041250441
her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals   14.446702192479108
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath   7.789003905959817
oh dear grandmamma are you worse   11.849888975511496
and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute   8.921987574934985
said the abbé in a peculiar tone he is happy   15.692954403765638
there are moments when a man grows young again in his children   11.78314191573473
tell us then d artagnan   14.706757934584664
perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight   4.090746014881935
those are indeed holidays to me   13.498853367919471
then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he said the prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday   9.169999066221992
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression   14.769741955524477
great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality   15.178599338593038
friquet   10.92816810379674

mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m   18.200311864583206
no no returned monte cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion   19.275023396687452
you never knew her   11.824105171854399
he caused me to be instructed gave me masters and when i was thirteen years of age he sold me to the sultan mahmoud   8.04848567105909
a don quixote clothed in a woolen doublet the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure   10.831781513560296
on tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and excitement   11.752578607698613
porthos and aramis did the same   8.208227821592134
exclaimed raoul alarmed   12.034376613393999
i shall stay here for a few days longer   17.044524954125556
ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered   15.904294523416825
she therefore contented herself with saying that m   9.872881421151133
thank you my dear beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice   19.60775806864317
and your excellency has one which was let to prince lobanieff   14.146027997763417
poor barrois was very thirsty and was thankful to drink anything he could find   12.080838431376002
none   10.210852196994814
three of them stopped after an hour s gallop and one fell down   15.28594674732324
we will read and sign the contract before we separate and this evening madame de villefort shall accompany valentine to her estate where we will rejoin them in a week   7.253666463800818
for the persons of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me i should break to pieces like glass   16.512260030000668
50261m i am he whom you sold and dishonored i am he whose betrothed you prostituted i am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortune i am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger i am he whom you also condemned to starvation and who yet forgives you because he hopes to be forgiven i am edmond dantès   14.634938585441702
he said nothing almost nothing scratches nothing more   8.07758958701709
and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf s remark   13.861342448110571
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting   16.26238973270376
i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him   15.075546022219392
the feather in his hat is worth at least five and twenty pistoles   17.095653759435763
listen madame said gondy   11.549411395982663
athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes   16.67416250317969
said d artagnan do you not recognize his highness the prince s carriage   17.726912666230604
yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it   13.228785412759825
but i did not expect you   10.56940316625494
noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot   15.257284682070573
albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for bertuccio but he was gone   18.05812503388768
caligula or nero those treasure seekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for   12.459847720248122
and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters   9.039044881923415
there were collected and piled up all albert s successive caprices hunting horns bass viols flutes a whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music   10.075504972591622
cried she clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven   17.08372980964704
but i what have i in the world   13.788201525887628
we will not constrain you to help us   9.675410468868776
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule   19.850856159534054
but before he had finished m   12.467852169608273
the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either faria s or dantès cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain   13.167212618990302
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him   19.34546930044039
you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body   7.409295460151798
morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew   11.379650053172854
stop   11.99297938977426
bonacieux and the duke entered the louvre without difficulty   2.720673570334693
well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited   11.666168548254289
but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers   10.630903641644297
these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom   10.606448005674165
chapter 62   17.65509945906701
yes said madame de villefort   5.11147082784296
but said the count so great was ali pasha s confidence that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care   15.04945801960637
porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter s skull and crushed it   19.941980442762375
you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are   12.58051864392248

he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me   10.99258658500337
no no   5.817187726777421
the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed   5.211876283787945
cried he what are we going there for   8.714529328750318
i have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly   9.260888422184308
and who now unable to kill anyone because his hands are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity perish   13.075334107360655
want of fortune perhaps   8.02956030381766
i am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance   8.629241987579036
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha   6.802014922014693
the old man s eyes remained fixed on the door   16.733256725282114
the lemonade morrel was in fact very happy   13.997780794979564
and you appear satisfied with the explanation   8.419988553079246
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped   8.551240777291095
said andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me   16.891407586720568
the drum beats   11.867599342678059
there is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime   18.62231087705567
continued she   12.659883950536392
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive   20.506746629823375
athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord   10.529594069924833
did she return home   8.744870924129138
of all this household only two persons deserve our notice   14.526917157576726
do you know his abode   8.765009137558877
her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water   14.270371859473615
now he said are you in pain   15.489115539732335
they reached the rue st   11.23770345287919
blacas remain   19.220114580048385
if he were not he would return to us   16.658280564466747
cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed seized his rapier and returned toward d artagnan   17.55578715022053
the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission   19.75151268880375
come come   5.488412096311109
by whom is it commanded   12.963744743247826

i hope said d artagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that i am worthy of it   13.97751556659461
our partnership began in the month of april   5.520833211649866
but you are no longer our masters   8.217258161052559
i think i hear a noise she said   8.536151727776137
bonacieux   12.985542171984997
charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected   6.602111140790247
well   10.353599046901317
athos arose   15.22058869538947
here s a promising fellow and it is i who have found out his merits said monsieur de chavigny   13.378937474906973
yes   3.5758313355749554
and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud   8.299283520021568
i should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years   4.76792398717786
oh yes yes   8.638444873128437
the ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one another s arms   5.446534536903997
may i not drink to your health and you to mine   14.991855550841201
yes it is one of milady s bastards   5.002787950341051
but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time   8.052724471584078
well said morcerf for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppæa while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl   9.426964139596205
oh he would kill me   14.994057802268987
when they reached the steps raoul saw three horses   24.219385254074187
the other one the gardener s   17.807389223344867
suppose i refuse   14.527387790628037
then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her room   15.745638542053934
have you succeeded   9.963218104703268
the young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance   17.723327765890566
i am lieutenant in his majesty s musketeers said d artagnan and consequently your superior in everything   11.484805280202632
dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was mistaken   8.97698636679035
presently the door opened and she perceived felton   17.153860378534496
i ask much too much perhaps for i have no title to request it   12.644989091848451
if i did i should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do   16.655657424360964
d artagnan had appointed six o clock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was right   7.772954706140315
said he is not that you whom i see yonder   8.37167559262017
he will tell thee what has become of her   8.761021357192133
and yet sir you may make me even happier than i am   9.198052896955017
if the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps i should not hesitate   11.394234240691684

one solitary feeble light was burning in the porter s lodge about forty paces distant from the house as baptistin had said   12.070708401207495
said the abbé   19.635351684982822
and he oh he   4.465630670478818
it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty   7.203068565322746
come you are no longer twenty years old   6.78237712815561
continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea   14.864351228840448
and remember that i am waiting for you   14.122864579978812
oh no   6.186595262896115
but where are you going monsieur where are you going   11.112380423422097
what game shall i find there   7.319619987648378
as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal   11.96878697445221
danglars riveted attention eugénie s composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair   7.115559924211336
what would you have   15.182988470475102
i never had a better friend than you   10.510413301174191
listen morrel it is noon   15.289411310966601
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated   16.60140922416435
we must therefore watch and play a close game   19.74077885217348
asked monte cristo   12.032103683029293
ah this is not right   14.785273663822043
you might have taken lord winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him   14.477278531652763
and planchet with aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by d artagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream   8.804960400716059
without her captain   17.553330329138685
and of what are you so sure   10.874288896182689
you will speak in italian said he   12.863472630190683
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companion s half reproachful observation on the subject   13.439203070184655
i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure   6.55004845055776
probably   11.949095968671466
her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor   10.196419013328086
forever   19.767888559341827
you haven t the heart to kill me   11.19726641241309
you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel one of my friends had not stopped him   12.532898279135308
if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us   12.052043261728233
albert de morcerf   6.330458456812591
they advanced towards a boat which a custom house officer held by a chain near the quay   12.119673027382795
yes count   14.527374051229419
cavalcanti   9.92863762748787

the lackey took his place by the coachman   11.976547588367442
and then there won t be any parliament at all   4.959602397647591
i have heard he had three or four millions   15.003340702287455
his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed   12.984548828780712
i did replied the count   10.808886147642916
do not concern yourself about that   12.07230171365227
the sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening   15.989043026959216
40070m from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass   12.571407604703829
ah my dear sir   14.054905471458778
m   8.44040117214273
for heaven s sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me   9.17637530830787
i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol   16.62612768191189
this letter is your game   6.097182927934365
that is rather difficult but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty   19.47069378960448
let us leave them she said   11.316186564547955
no replied d artagnan   14.516351382142522
thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle eugénie perceives i am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions   15.02732928791783
to himself my friend to himself   17.78010336080846
charles stuart said the colonel of the english regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner   8.097177056909231
anyone can see he s a gentleman   13.808284403153346
who was your brother   7.613442968551281
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her   10.434184315407292
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices   11.141614474433604
and he made the same friendly salute as d artagnan   11.970361963937409
the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph   14.287089766616894
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips   11.138763724155027
cried friquet you re meddling too   9.256809581619702
50089m maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtier s eyes seemed to say quicker quicker   10.837614642579377
i think so   15.530488090862312
you see it is your interest to take my bank notes   13.595916115690187
fontrailles his aide de camp had an arm broken   5.029518998004991
what is that   11.876445745964643
noirtier s reason answered morrel i can readily believe it to be a good one   11.142532180965615
exactly   10.261192593332863
adieu my kind friends   17.837433293401595
then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity   6.148638756559427
they don t have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four   12.856332859843633
monte cristo waited for the two who remained   11.440084344968064
i also replied mercédès am going and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me   9.549869217243607
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice   10.730835273825459
but go a little way from france go either to aleppo or cairo or only to naples or rome and you will see people passing by you in the streets people erect smiling and fresh colored of whom asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say that man was poisoned three weeks ago   14.379611522941508
chapter xxxix   7.006788465087433
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant   5.218641404974038
30315m villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball   8.516845073438756
de villefort s office   9.074098866464945
was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality   4.539379158717554
in the street of saint thomas du louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of quinze vingts   13.160098948175234
but you were ill and illness renders the head weak therefore you may be excused   15.95730136598044
well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and to night they have sold you for two hundred thousand pounds that is to say for half what is owing them   11.705323454797748
oh   14.322352343872735
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women   12.816286392657176
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire   14.863062542485464
i am all attention said eugénie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze   11.720262763210217
pooh   6.2852432288223685
because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a corsican s nature to revenge himself   14.469314303849806
and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man s shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size   10.900194035604855
edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was   21.824429035879152
felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord over the handkerchief   12.13211512086233
whereas on my honor monsieur de chavigny though i ve been here a week has not ordered so much as a tartlet   1.3179128868047698
yes you are right   0.5135694525502998
but m   13.441077407750589
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite   11.880419373521308
well said he filling the glasses let us drink to captain edmond dantès husband of the beautiful catalane   10.63342957672499
they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted d artagnan to rueil   12.127076376976289
he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport   23.695709622193963
never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me   11.169011750711595
it is waiting for us at greenwich opposite the isle of dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights   15.826406790450365
the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception   17.610312985749445
and of what religion are you then madame   23.592675377511835
bertuccio lay covers for three   11.874574785429346
i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses   10.84051583552366
for a thousand pistoles   13.367080265956783
his palace was my paradise   14.681064330859762
wretched wretched that i am   14.918061197022942
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound   20.00972673385768
through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park   10.397257651496918
on arriving at the rue des prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the church   10.451982993268034
not so bad yet replied athos   11.555999455519284
i know that by name at least   2.7700195470338524
the window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than before   15.457614010114833
the boat was now moving with the wind   6.6954699426253175
they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville   12.053174861665186
with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and faria had been equally silent   11.608696029677837
when i had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a word   5.107976832695168
yes the king   16.78730508921204
the sport was bad   7.072169763882116
you wring my heart   12.957075667770487
on your brow i read despair your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings your hands tremble   3.8635312684597114
ah i had eighty louis before me   6.46308355102593
ah   11.610682802816026
murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired   11.843905667898142
i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome   14.46877509921561
come then said d artagnan you are right   14.257739949582618
and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success   13.576469665705659
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed   11.922720423069011
turning to his friend dear maximilian said the count have you nothing to do in this land   11.738225019760902
anne then motioned to d artagnan to approach and he obeyed   15.718831143451725
he sees no one but the king   14.300813019320941
i did not expect to see you again said he feebly to dantès   12.047188131797453
bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom   9.246060996773663
about my height   11.203227542567006
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood   9.701874121573105
the queen was still standing when he entered   12.169668279788112
now continued carlini if i have done wrongly avenge her   9.534641511314334
noirtier whom you see here   4.598611887508514
one opposite to me the other with his back to me   13.134158084946701
he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet   5.342024205736297
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers   13.230903570659986
i could mount him with thirty balls in my body   4.277482102524778
then she picked up friquet   14.481027808464928
follow you   11.145141083090724
she is some emissary of the cardinal   10.213593476249258
it concerns nothing less said d artagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the queen   17.606853152155168
for an apprentice musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love   17.541337134779816
dantès was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead   5.45450093679726
some one who would know how to cry aloud to them that all france might hear it that it is mazarin who has reduced them to poverty   16.343270082891905
and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god   13.595123259987105
if m   10.874773002021541
i say my dear d herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan   10.087027088041271
the demands in that programme must be granted   9.202243766862892
chapter xxix   15.6015501049088
yes yes   12.581186274134494
you still confide then in sinbad the sailor   12.807480824547541
ha   14.53475530543926
valentine seized the count s hand   7.531066015748861
do you think so   14.228183713981666
the frenchman knocked at the inner door and entered the first room   8.535813760861716
besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration   18.805233610428218
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand   9.88896077920498
and moreover my dear child continued d artagnan i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian   11.246436883027156
no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts but such as he really was at this period   14.500876366462718
he was her grandfather on the mother s side   11.345968769432409
some of the inmates of the lions den were watching the operations of the prisoner s toilet with considerable interest   8.477441719547349
upon that athos yielded   14.394397644719303
lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient   7.85517895606294
but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits   11.656925115792559
it shall be so   9.11681442108846
she will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies   12.687454675036896
one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind   9.871079423947819
i don t know   16.100934795714004
oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered albert   8.979097082844083
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister instead of aiding to crush him   15.368931544861933
i am acquainted with it   13.617246192882911
the king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied   13.794874393534387
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled   14.277264515995029
something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne   9.615191067464934
but they may come any moment for you left word that i awaited them   17.221031465954184
said the musketeers   7.766991135437487
nevertheless it was plain the letter came from milady   16.409626074573886
he can always be found as tréville says   8.94711419826951
and so in fact he is said the owner   5.8249890185137705
he conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks   18.547306595492593
as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about   12.671541587814414
i am a gascon said i only when i succeed   4.485403052690814
ah   13.953890235313924
replied monte cristo with bitter irony   9.789983416394893
he passed over my head and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps   15.664533248610523
then cried villefort was it you who bought m   12.948577398234466
if your eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said milady perhaps i should partake of your confidence as to the future   11.525920218935955
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de tréville   10.185586116696808
1   13.082748557300942
adieu valentine repeated morrel   13.377866192296938
in april you went to dine at the minister s   10.509734355323173
it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply   5.544061854304219
you mean to say we have lost said athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table   11.504334414459294
at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears appeared   19.369200331059858
but you who are a reasonable being lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountain head surely you ought to prevent it said morcerf with a smile   9.339262877064856
this indeed is praiseworthy nay more it is sublime   14.912393560345254
but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking   14.759093325218988
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you can   8.163298456277431
replied d artagnan   12.804946083327357
and if i went to seek vampa would you accompany me   18.698899117945142
said athos you require too much d artagnan   6.021297058953886
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs   11.003556621761513
but he seemed to me cold   16.69922101718851
oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding grisette   13.083511249859125
into what room did you take him   17.162125411276268
haydée what an adorable name   11.182578605253685
one takes no note of time   13.286664894501484
well my faith   16.816353584217488
i will not appear to parley with rebels   13.039098934191273
you are mistaken i am not the count of monte cristo   11.390242810363004
a deathlike silence oppressed all nature   5.348528143410999
as we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him   3.910478148170885
i can not see   11.221098042475377
have you seen   11.737805122965273
i have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was concerned in the abduction of madame bonacieux   10.90110013982862
he was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet   7.760219971210855
you are welcome count   7.782292531395657
14   19.301853385767696
yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin   17.618286878406533
so you see we must do without this little superfluity   6.023820896908694
bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world   11.005814265472138
the governor can be present   13.312163232211176
still   15.157717980954102
the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses he saw albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need   11.244516626205511
albert rose to return to his place   14.470755922867907
he is a coward   10.927194040309214
d artagnan s arm dropped to his side   8.746277165105312
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden   13.889803807219236
d artagnan remained standing and examined this man   4.3645875779741345
in fact they touched the sloop   6.282573360879043
judge for yourself replied he   16.85444858255745
really did they   12.661523253612474
then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn   14.95387068849962
what   15.671885302056326
but never mind i will put up with it for the sake of remaining with you   17.25625889871098
asked another musketeer without addressing anyone in particular but on the contrary speaking to everybody   10.18042380800507
bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand   17.342455818204186
at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms the troops were firing from underneath   3.277897569740839
aha   15.019601601065887
said athos   20.363852143269646
among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words behold the misery of the people   15.916635043548464
my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat   12.454517628649162
thomson french   10.1251650536854
debray   19.017692214029278
sir said planchet you must know   13.350966123309064
beauchamp is a worthy fellow said monte cristo when the journalist was gone   9.690797994531277
i may be mistaken but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display   14.62465037983467
be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which d artagnan took and shook in his   9.013348475171945
i beg you to excuse me madame   12.445766363201784
you have been asked politely and every question is worth an answer   17.688501123781545
yes no doubt but improved upon by ours   13.440754815588205
your power is great i know   10.208734710678225
valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images   7.122514178116488
what is that   15.275139459068683
we are cousins it appears monsieur porthos   12.571136697083134
what line would you advise me to study   17.34523914886631
but one has come of itself   18.344268575085053
oh plenty   1.1614853873349045
m   10.599882990104302
monsieur if she has escaped it is not my fault i swear   15.921556899049891
as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea table   12.590916811488384
she makes the young look ever forward not behind   8.059501241214779
oh attend to it valentine i entreat you   10.41395250659593
morrel uttered a loud exclamation and frantic doubtful dazzled as though by a celestial vision he fell upon his knees   11.266757862320427
franz d épinay   12.785039553635517
asked the sweet silvery voice of mercédès   13.524372711505453
yes count said milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met   12.55882775253949
but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman   4.0834943468038905
said château renaud passing his arms through the young captain s   8.975024321286792
chapter xvi   10.992832317192699
said d artagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance   6.307874972657629
when he was quite a child and only a shepherd i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arms   18.05510442434592
de tréville as he has ended by styling himself in paris had really commenced life as d artagnan now did   16.162996840748065
yet i expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment   18.942631430725086
i have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention i believe of making me a soldier   18.707254482449734
tell us   10.678078372033935
louis above the order of notre dame du mont carmel and st   5.917608698125847
the secret has been well kept   16.094495631391723
i have full and perfect confidence in him   18.058368957779827
but will you have the kindness to wait a moment   14.285125987933903
he will set sail tomorrow morning   16.42899688685734
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal   16.735947824903924
doctor every son of woman is born to suffer and to die   15.592738638027301
i am an honorable man   9.758596210488623
what would you do   9.167644860704513
said she   15.513682180734964
e   14.513181621669574
ah indeed   6.075427976323754
ali had indeed given proof of this   19.554983607504084
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a good natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work   14.998188010151399
be silent you simpleton   12.671685246617924
and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended   14.681087363290438
he went toward the place where he had left him   11.92594920000503
the four friends followed ten paces behind him   12.43479041908646
do you see that island   10.821429766604222
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket   14.515278891423726
if we release the prisoner thus we shall never know the truth   10.106012023930646
possibly   6.185548814838939
so much the better so much the better said caderousse   15.531358394829683
i hope it does not exceed she stopped   10.040272103551912
oh nothing easier   13.601634601069584
on the contrary do not look at him but at this   8.545207959454732
soldiers are big children   10.334927161314663
go then animal said the duke   17.380968577135132
because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it   15.439385356854267
no you did not   8.761795193999301
but the hackney coach drove on and the head of neither mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband   12.943745237487795
no my lord replied the gascon   15.661986601937699
and mind if the wine is bad we will send him to find better   11.28211523273949
giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord for in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness d artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible   8.191672274803881
but i wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creature the more so as you tell me this d artagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor   14.011025738033227
and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you   7.361519021589153
what is there then behind this wall   11.45397609684199
morrel looked around him and then drawing dantès on one side he said suddenly and how is the emperor   11.607452484492583
noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m   13.521944759677865
a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings   15.995415231961001
we must fire as long as we have loaded guns   18.82891873986722
he however darted not the less quickly toward milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron   9.597688644141162
said d artagnan   9.282914815259801
he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness   7.421674185085853
i was going to say if i were in your place well   13.659606627196611
d artagnan said athos this is no joke i trust   9.365025448391224
i am not condemning you for this monsieur baptistin   9.686272036720043
well now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame bonacieux   11.177016865199723
leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me   6.370973882346043
i shall pass through those who attack me   10.196091570547274
vampa took cucumetto s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn teresa remained outside   13.257456847384107
speak i beg you   13.043019458229942
from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep   7.523124707827057
villefort s conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage   17.717247529725782
you are in no doubt on that score   9.40793610264015
i see   10.800545162825554
for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to lord de winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queen s carriage had left the court   14.749847687982907
he fought like a furious tiger turning ten times round his adversary and changing his ground and his guard twenty times   17.5050235572012
meanwhile she is not very wretched   17.50659629287316
your horse is falling said porthos reining in his own   7.206389666243647
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de médicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik   8.689866174614743
speak freely   11.016016761934567
she opened and found the word secret   9.855537025166656
here said he is a proof of my satisfaction   16.90771999132037
most undoubtedly   15.678005360711762
does the letter contain anything valuable   9.220567177781799
i have however already told you sir i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter   13.765514297830432
a glorious prize   18.13542937231017
very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate   16.067258003899077
resounded through the city   16.483549552866194
thou again   9.763790965667553
then as they had been accustomed to do they had recourse to m   11.658175819676309
he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it   14.847751980560897
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door   12.94598442419247
they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent   4.649438576288591
a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england   5.4618796038027115
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor   12.251961162811364
yes yes the mortuary deposition   22.807395224029463
and do you really repent   12.265555418525762
but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply   13.506135520126039
returned rochefort   16.468119284946248
she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of d artagnan and even gave him her hand to kiss   15.983218238351654
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable   7.284887784453294
the image of devastation and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over a field of battle   14.507336875052102
athos raised his sword   9.395310576734957
one throw is soon made   10.469754682883389
i will not have you left alone so long   14.642662865016591
they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass   11.924888040226316
courted by my step mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom   7.048744785118765
they demanded 6 000 francs   17.009098489567574
is there nothing more you wish   13.520123606819302
bonacieux eagerly and looking at d artagnan with disquiet   14.527173113248866
d artagnan recognized the cardinal   13.43288569113548
and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious   5.491132933956969
it appears the conquerors had something else to do   13.60913285016183
de villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour   9.84256664277637
i believe he s swimming toward us   3.6809837951071582
yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty   16.01555965139924
i believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for i did not ask not being inquisitive   10.015572456157713
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious   15.43532483167515
franz entered the hotel   4.732913918174748
ah   10.223002870193907
said lord de winter   12.596953274039105
a florentine adventurer sire and that was all   24.3200797777492
his presence produced a good effect   6.676070972535281
his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the fight   11.183267911813115
m   13.048207219068424
oh sir   6.872915521673142
replied d artagnan   16.777611589126863
meanwhile the heat became excessive   9.593621476429552
no answered porthos mouston has no desire to fight   16.70866642843158
planchet and fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor   13.704595285187462
on   18.35575516264109
the man made no reply   18.012746074426367
he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor   7.461456016500123
one night however i heard his sobs and i could not resist my desire to go up to him but when i reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying   14.36695650719937
the three friends hastened toward d artagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse   13.425689755123834
they lost her   17.132921951294573
indeed   17.563649792460538
alas no   15.557100404711445
this is the case said d artagnan   12.848228866683773
you really vilify me   11.662908027860528
cried the jesuit   9.01378891012596
they both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak   16.615881979429602
but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night   12.623994829818706
perused too the application dated 10th april 1815 in which morrel by the deputy procureur s advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort s certificates rendered indisputable   8.224176715862356
said monte cristo   6.728291784965658
and the major gave a letter into the young man s hand   14.162300598242267
i have just been with him   12.585678085388572
in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions   14.691384994896282
things look black enough replied porthos   8.503993955552348
noirtier the girondin   14.338463028081438
you will say that i keep it   8.784134995468627
ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot   13.820961180823538
he was the worst musketeer and the most unconvivial companion imaginable   17.362138408379067
dantès redoubled his efforts   15.094789165663743
and then immediately the eyes of porthos wandered anxiously   13.949596694186836
it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have forgotten   21.10961319024905
do you hear not a single creature   0.17982667472722547
i see   10.683697691442866
and we sailed under mizzen topsails and top gallant sails   10.701741395589057
the adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other not that m   7.459894584076115
i believe that besides the packet captain leclere confided a letter to his care   12.077253249870687
valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in noirtier s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind   13.15313574287859
he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy   13.727661866255271
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions   13.110762720278402
and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting   20.1588503092092
porthos gained fifty pistoles from groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be   4.768404917660233
exclaimed the terrible interrogator   9.678537454352416
my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady   11.482140586231733
then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty   16.145241067761315
swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown   11.49491197594446
i actually love no one sir   11.509457797493786
just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to bertuccio said excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner   12.725380042457028
but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me   10.663132738638991
morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness   9.696996871214003
and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible   12.808850108999476
the coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses   14.377350558497929
my faith   10.139990305902685
oh   11.496467869894381
would you pass in his eyes for a prophet   18.174234782431515
her crimes i know them not   8.881366889755675
who was it you were talking with over there   3.3223857579564537
i have my conditions to impose   12.401906593027055
as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo   10.661722098129262
you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated   5.644841679044437
i lent you money and you returned it   15.197186027994313
nothing is easier madame   10.37277560312852
and when is the wedding to be   11.431852380789127
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs   16.18550009712637
well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever   10.87414016283549
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos   7.796089572936681
saved   9.12459434510571
come in said franz   6.492155095468617
eight hundred livres   17.02803661416735
eh then what are the sentinels about   7.474359290529801

what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty   9.66461421389338
the abbé burst into a fit of laughter while dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment   10.409738232290518
quick   12.608994008608498
here s the letter he sent by a messenger for sixpence who sold it to me for a guinea   9.779051049537596
thirty strides brought them to dry land   12.242867954599673
he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of nessus insatiate in torture   9.71312949411612
let me speak to her of the east   10.504840883615717
oh do not be alarmed   9.325949248588646
by the bye he said i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for porthos and d artagnan   15.919885415278074
but exclaimed monte cristo why was i absent   8.510397868144935
8   12.075997741125901
sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least   11.42564053216496
as the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door   16.773374127664884
thanks guitant   8.273114817170146
the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor   6.295368352753467
i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said haydée quietly   19.48385798129977
then we set sail to night   14.597635995494192
leave us alone then and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves   15.010898490359345
the hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence   11.70866410095454
well that she may have no doubt on that head i will go and inform her myself   7.441778386275249
where i am going   10.114666126259689

ah i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man said mme   11.113703639066804
the elder prisoner pondered the matter   7.631651066113573
i thought that madame was ill and i wished to bring her help responded the maid frightened at the terrible expression which had come over her mistress s face   7.415480231276767
we have lost too much already   17.331247936661867
you didn t tell me of that aramis   2.33870186283616
admirable   15.739952480339749
i faith yes said athos for i am hungry   9.033352467881631
silence and fatigue together overcame d artagnan and sleep overtook him also   14.611243256874511
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour   13.243569130371016
she broke the silence   14.171078653142443
the queen entered   8.782814919485814
your age   14.940663930878685
at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed   15.228112967949954
and here is andrea cavalcanti s baptismal register given by the curé of saravezza   12.276134503795872
the death of m   8.26327308303513
asked athos   20.98379877826949
valentine could not reply   8.042602271957882
and he went   16.311716293545995
morrel had agreed to meet him   9.614142143307472
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know d artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul   16.225682931921
if he persists   1.320588466908692
yes gentlemen in the king s room   15.344646392733942
war between england and france was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carousal   5.029254950532406
ah how good you are to say so valentine   6.313157567912898
gutenberg   14.412910183695178
m   13.753652285882337
and acting upon this principle the banker s daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise d armilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company   15.482913912650263
the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings   10.924158355550416
yes yes said albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our children s children and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to you for had this been known oh beauchamp i should have destroyed myself   14.102326683951912
broussel then proceeded to his wife s room and asked for breakfast   10.935292354186748
punctuality said monte cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns i think   13.937810524653218
asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother   20.055151987247438
monte cristo had pronounced the name of fernand with such an expression of hatred that mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every vein   6.821930049548593
i don t say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind it s a sure way to prevent it s coming true   11.817927156322641
have pity on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself   8.066616348171989
beauchamp   4.328875923644865
that tall harsh looking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute   5.836547934046284
we have the first throw   11.474615589467703
in a short time the two unfortunate beasts who had not eaten anything since the morning made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged   9.375598161765978
oh heavens exclaimed valentine who was supporting the head of morrel on her shoulder do you not see how pale she is   13.670387487417159
good day m   9.074547992788894
i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give   11.409207732566259
true said louis xviii   15.664883448005684
ah   16.2824881799504
in one of the mourning coaches beauchamp debray and château renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness   11.341915461042557
perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for   9.972985861001
and lastly the most convincing proof i can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life   8.86896253407317
no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure   6.704334747144502
i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent   17.850108183099508
the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts   15.518232443996629
she is going to have him killed said d artagnan to porthos but at all events it shall not be by me   8.700908151195376
cried d artagnan and spur for your dear lives   19.2214209377005
my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes   9.148220702303115
have i friends   20.134190475416048
and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10 000 francs will you have your supper with us   16.15589149371023
he bowed   14.794706597694505
so too was the door of athos s chamber and that of the park   9.72239054178706
i will see the queen   7.95489804029672
he was one of those english tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling   14.174082989735581
demanded the baroness springing to the window   9.184863518198053
this son is named andrea cavalcanti   13.11525437398429
in that case his last hope would have been destroyed   9.72601387888687
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you   15.978486785388505
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman s side   13.728065950145997
exclaimed d artagnan bounding toward him who says that athos is afraid   14.946816385031184
but she was cruelly and promptly undeceived   7.07278602551793

all i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there nonsense   16.24029641581549
watch everything hear everything interpret everything   19.48551994951932
but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events   15.058159384648249
asked the abbé   8.448139449234851
he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man   8.452510032969649
for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe   18.95903111610335
on whom does my bleeding heart repose   10.42287216843593
you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today   10.90063109819987
which you refused   13.827743393385843
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when monte cristo went one evening to pay m   11.047285980920288
i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence   5.661206665442322
i attach myself to it   16.304097984645708
an old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hands   16.400162035365344
comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor   15.133002467998875
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her   19.749012299159244
the countess g insists upon it that he is a vampire   9.974781270696212
know it   5.539346011041566
de villefort be for all your goodness   2.398332702215665
ah ah   18.087733391397794
0303m but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret   6.525361600337745
we will go and see said the doctor   7.342951075111353
sire   13.339869461666508
for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred   13.642185891364848
yes   18.666008216477127
winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours   13.158571228453889
ah   18.496577683819197
d artagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past m   14.340077945918674
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman   11.542837489685613
and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m   7.582838903571721
speak doctor i am listening said villefort   16.293389641850506
impossible   15.02141061443034
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet   2.862482183732725
depend upon it i know what i say   8.987605583301455
really said athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so   16.218952467034676
explain yourself   12.464502222908644
easily said monte cristo   21.048943127721635
listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him   11.616186434479328
then with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex eugénie drew on the boots and pantaloons tied her cravat buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure   4.983457005481396
do you possess that right over bertuccio   11.875082787721613
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel   17.105548076092468
cried monte cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which morrel was raising towards heaven   15.401789961430044
but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth   15.280356249298396
and you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons were separated by a distance of fifty feet   11.916966718407224
porthos remained silent and motionless   3.4890059299349065
asked the count   9.483727777589374
then turning to mercédès he inquired who is this gentleman   9.543977900990399
that was a noble example to follow monsieur   10.049137097016281
he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours   15.078314861227126
teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing room   8.234288487413357
he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day   10.73366520609127
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library   6.63937927358876
he sent them two excellent horses and the fugitives went out hastily from tours shaping their course toward spain trembling at the least noise following unfrequented roads and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn   10.597888170203301
that man is a messenger of general cromwell   16.324308307201083
on one of those immense staircases upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house ascended and descended the office seekers of paris who ran after any sort of favor gentlemen from the provinces anxious to be enrolled and servants in all sorts of liveries bringing and carrying messages between their masters and m   4.855683386589116
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m   11.93601237251425
then answered albert i am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse was   24.74919466321341
the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred   20.630244056723114
the bonnes fortunes of de tréville were talked of as those of m   5.374840726348197
remain here fasten the door inside and open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this   14.868644649586036
you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felon s life might live as other men   4.294659067697475
as for eugénie she was as strong as a judith or a delilah   14.75581734439713
but what do you expect   11.480564683911249
he exclaimed i forgot the recommendation of de comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four headed combination of devils   5.865089522496452
she looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfather s room but on the stairs she met m   10.33564069766778
but d artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him   17.918312916045117
swear to nothing   10.673636744888515
hope   15.037806817651662
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin   2.3077223698697757
oh fear not said maximilian stopping at a short distance i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me   9.587011941179105
instead of going direct to his study m   16.013161879029454
héloïse de villefort   19.56178837172012
at daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of caderousse   12.393722572941563
porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income   4.352514873190585
monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished   5.397728949398805
you understand me replied villefort affectionately   7.260448011450549
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so much   7.025744691253733
let us go back to our places   5.61738037630913
the old man died as i have told you   11.04674944157516
i have not failed to do so your reverences replied the young man returning their salutation   12.754508219745437
however that may be d artagnan replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true   9.498829672461818
as for me when i have no candle i can t take two steps without knocking against something   13.478416589583345
if they meant to execute him at la grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of execution   10.455433362593492
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath   8.132914381133467
cried caderousse   8.877643509165772
truly said monte cristo with your post horses going at the rate of two leagues an hour and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or ill tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move   13.643750350336363
the coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed   7.055676858759732
is all safe m   5.411735488355609
gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late   17.113842579233697
we have had great annoyances there   11.311381474848446
ah ah   9.423498600626232
nothing dulls the intellect like sleep   10.181418119112145
that name sounds strange to you said athos smiling   12.07051623621425
and yet he but desired the good of the people   14.678483794972463
well comte i am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the prince de marsillac who is happily in paris just now   9.048012031619674
see what good fortune i brought you   10.712867248015021
and on what have you written all this   17.44174058276517
then he murmured the words of the english poet frailty thy name is woman   13.610324145137398
the musketeers hastening to the hôtel of m   15.252341816411702
d artagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise   19.49589346843649
40062m well what is haydée to ali tepelini   16.40073187767147
it was no longer the same man the fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him   9.36771639082982
how dare you tear out the drawings   14.296809351322725
yes sir i certainly committed that imprudence   10.406097994556617
thank you   8.918249909053126
himself   10.367236054898939
but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity   17.269100999054327
oh i obtained or rather claimed that   8.121605135179028
if anything yet remains of that great that sublime king henry of whom you have just spoken he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself   20.506065659059413
but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur d artagnan for i can affirm sire if i can believe what he says that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal   9.881734417620187
are they in danger of dying   15.885063244621616
leave the room and send me a woman   12.874719586296033
well   9.47084374495086
let us try not to jest if we can   13.970421458977656
i asked said athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure   12.506274308990257
said porthos let us hear what he says   11.03418408691519
but to dantès eye there was no darkness   6.525665364150028
and if we do overtake him   15.47065423768309
your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it   5.194114501185902
he was a foundling   21.573964646512245
noirtier   15.37338364106601
to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services   19.55661605852777
teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him   12.206064327118085
but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two words   14.000491933108018
our béarnais was a prudent lad however young he might be   15.701961985186404
let me see your plan   12.573801453356023
asked la ramee   7.749210103122703
there will be time for both   14.799691003578346
upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could   11.501369733559669
the one m   11.828973556293246
how monsieur an investigation of my papers mine   11.77633869262099
yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself all is not lost for that order is not signed   18.470939398287175
yes he has just gone out   12.122781436163324
said athos   10.964643658335266
preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that   7.935172922010644
yes i am known so that proceed my dear monsieur cavalcanti   8.922821742295152
but listen to me valentine and i will tell you all about it   9.840995922850947
fortunately it is too short by six feet   11.385885730753127
since you know the solution of it i ask no further   15.383478975516429
well i have ten thousand for you   6.913079120343036
mordaunt   14.477752979278838
athos placed his two hands on d artagnan s shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad smile   11.877620908678667
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty   6.562081680529645
what can i know of him   7.608796853126278
as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it   17.409223031552294
i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly   13.519041206562092
you are going to make a patriarch of him   11.137516167954338
then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation   5.053086741592184
why i expect to be made marechal of france   13.761610513383955
oh mercédès i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair   12.453870269652565
d artagnan trembled   14.859817058543827
oh i recollect him perfectly cried m   16.637215729304707
de saint méran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression   14.601669884201675
with all my heart returned albert   6.0168929130507784
really said planchet   5.48593436017596
yes horse   8.981221184835682
after the execution   3.505512595535448
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir   13.901686802157055
the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other   10.700659165056207
the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church   13.765715244960424
this door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian nights opening at the sesame of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world   1.8499660758748409
they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay   11.965482484876835
no   6.9885632515149325
how can not be   6.659633963005004
cried the duchess seizing athos s hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you   13.839752433619608
said he   14.979221658319721
yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four hundred   19.067304741497058
m   10.164923763112673
or from your generosity my friend   6.027261710638736
conclusion on the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of buckingham s assassination   5.870928979329342
the halberds were for the audience in the rear   10.769631078467107
asked d artagnan as they hurried along   14.472867650983014
but i thought you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival   9.058232283432023
i have been advised of it   13.509958102189401
plenty   12.475487766354695
but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with anger   8.101856820228287
ah me   9.380564150447988
3   9.28143202439634
ali had received his instructions and went down the corso crossed the campo vaccino went up the strada san gregorio and reached the gates of st   7.950878568769147
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture   12.051456251308228
do you think i love you   12.722472984598204
i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders   16.299060113894818
madame where do you keep the poison you generally use   12.791512542423376
d épinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty   13.27122959015087
cried the gascon don t threaten   5.67644797231342
as they stopped at the door of the cardinal s study d artagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his shoulder   17.698390920260916
the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered   11.693249547651499
she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair   14.431856526273338
now i have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics and that in all humility that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have caused me to neglect study a little   13.857596638281315
all that edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss grown rock   11.839838245162742
that is impossible replied the governor   11.691671955150175
why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me   9.787045019806342
where are your passports   19.668880181862484
i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained 400 000 francs by it of which 100 000 have been honestly paid to you   8.391541098488537
will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of silence   14.949862005001531
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine   11.301795520112488
every revolution has its catastrophes returned m   22.21583645457202
outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection   7.453155475452788
now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday   17.57598382442796
it was simply yet richly furnished   22.453554860034632
although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual time   12.33368480066873
said the king what shall we do   8.049391079718102
they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to d artagnan   13.50817749865107
then d artagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting   11.790842480990904
you will not watch me   19.162550216289993
i once spoke to you of four men   10.331323567971202
that name written in her hand   15.70673844317664
as the ransom of a young christian slave of eleven years of age named haydée the acknowledged daughter of the late lord ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his favorite   21.065301195869708
d artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many   15.62627891885469
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way   10.385032672014898
he himself was not in question but his horse was   12.4132516209238
monseigneur said d artagnan this was what happened to me never mind never mind   9.449772517326913
no replied the young man   24.497734471468743
let us strive i beseech you let us strive to be cheerful   15.49470942143488
whitehall   15.793760404057736
mine you have heard and that is to pursue you on earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of god   12.04267669198619
the sergeant saw that d artagnan was in earnest   12.683295177591667
my weapons   13.193941419099742
and you are afraid i shall be unhappy   7.9901211478790675
and she made a sign for kitty to leave the room   12.638907944327002
bonacieux   20.19102456689205
de tréville in his office contiguous to this antechamber received visits listened to complaints gave his orders and like the king in his balcony at the louvre had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms   12.008167065186342
you are exactly in the spot   11.988655295540463
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere   15.831502877477268
serpent muttered d artagnan i would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name   11.695998750022262
and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth   21.201090448457226
you and your two friends and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty if we should meet him   14.499544490530008
i don t know   9.139475210474465
when he had concluded his speech beauchamp bowed coldly to albert turned his back upon him and went to the press room   13.461309494255135
were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clément ever known   26.435405574201308
it is singular said d artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i can not yet remember   11.439447275432078
the officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon deck   9.467796062617868
be assured then of seeing me soon return   12.30031611868776
ah   14.29512542416754
why should i   10.3160993248568
oh   8.40274137341047
shall you see the king again   10.580952468360932
very well you can retire m   11.075596733866758
now resumed grimaud i ve only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest me   15.008612151099134
another valet was engaged for himself a new servant for noirtier two women had entered madame de villefort s service in fact everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new faces were presented to the different masters of the house thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family   13.944085437596181
cried d artagnan to the coachman   12.086913349809652
and that in the presence of witnesses   14.689723781355568
when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well   7.478790555357614
the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber   14.062180645391173
gentlemen cried chatillon the truce is broken that is evident   10.169405053175591
then he slowly uttered these words who is now dying in your house   14.70333293994765
ma foi   18.056008989034538
in fact the procession arrived in safety at notre dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a te deum   19.719154656950487
you believed that i would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch   11.956982383592447
a captain is nothing but a father of a family charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary family   18.350533522352812
i don t know much about it said athos   4.671604816586587
asked the one who carried the lantern   14.324426665530348
well be it so   11.743525825178782
but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes   5.603261210039186
if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood   13.444846306063617
rest yourself first my lord and we we will reflect   11.452665202250438
org   11.357669244515503
but what danger threatens him then emmanuel   14.70666263221962
ah yes i am indeed deserted   6.1769824798389905
said the englishman i have the key of that door   11.44062322702648
this portrait attracted the count of monte cristo s attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it   15.896344508103411
he sends me for that purpose and here i am   13.621438684892325
ah i understand said beauchamp on our friend albert s account   2.983789424587364
my mother begs you to come   11.434820692127852
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market   14.366511177708581
the four lackeys guarded the door and the window   15.42020420918046
you have never seen our africans count   9.45624389767465
grimaud came rubbing his half open eyes to answer this noisy summons and d artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lackey   10.18392972976066
well   12.828176715369075
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors   14.58719918831278
of what kind in the name of wonder   17.98050835225439
and it was they who told you something which made you angry   20.91004985239341
my good friend said albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not   8.225145349656001
yes indeed my dear duke   11.225762804367328
let us load the guns   8.535675006396037
asked porthos   22.82838988629804
alas   11.489097486492842
a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures   17.505873947969054
i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches   11.226741831924805
and dantès knew it from the first to the last word   7.161750661647051
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance   8.301811358845482
inquired the count   11.303501686486047
with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud   10.281219029155599
have a care cried porthos to his opponent   17.39399445506012
the veins of the throat swelled   5.0721039618005115
the daughter of henry iv   9.130301158565572
entirely my dear count   17.516571973161522
where are you   14.915916632073763
yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him   12.658079233865962
very well said d artagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me planchet   16.444419405177584
a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat   15.821862823407233
and is he aware of the danger he has been in   12.82887031028144
sir replied haydée i have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief   9.913370639663892
and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own   15.913717427522077
will it be long first   18.86874836571607
the devil   15.727856063965204
this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives   14.45658318115304
the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief   13.644702904931032
give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of the cavalcanti   13.126128082257415
answered porthos   14.036894542957203
what was it that you thought   6.7516438645220385
perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but i love him for showing so much interest in you   10.100692544912429
there is a dupe somewhere   1.779110252793025
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in sight of the place   11.461507486287305
cried athos   15.030251504561535
to do with you my lord   13.423824038433006
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily   13.03749650569787
he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man and fainted   12.532479915925407
believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are there   10.962725947555969
at length i heard the well known noise of the door which opened and shut   9.809492299886458
in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him   10.322042966031468
i had been told but would not credit it that the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of ali pasha   14.77866105094415
the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad   16.627237519166464
you are my uncle   14.771959287276403
well said porthos replied d artagnan   17.110381512746102
ah   7.904555161870165
there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day   17.104115901399137
there is only the comparison of one state with another nothing more   12.224067699986765
the explosion soon followed   12.910998569071786
the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed   9.815868337040634
this diamond   9.92350264110804
oh nothing but a scratch said d artagnan   10.498229838223327
you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended   7.909714291380412
i like rustaud my lord   9.20440604393276
i absolve you   12.069625379254141
but i was hot headed just as if i had been drinking   9.965345539306362
what say you to that   8.271511994228616
you are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer   14.703542467499524
he s not going on a message for he goes secretly   13.093223213580432
when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan   19.147087980864512
and you say that dantès has gone to the catalans   13.604537780334223
i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison   16.79112689174042
all the same it is well to be certain   19.59507713214491
come i beseech you lend me twenty francs so that i may buy a dressing gown   13.136842413952705
morrel s service and a most singular change had taken place in his position   18.124508939644166
they have selected a field of battle on which i am an abler general than they that of a conference   6.8735660018436455
porthos wanted to follow him   14.450562216013648
d artagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench   6.18877185728329
is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante chamber   14.824774619611585
while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron s meditations whatever they were the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should dissipate his master s happy reverie   9.127695296508936
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and d artagnan turned to him   14.345520055793868
as he said this the man came towards edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence   11.676804803609695

he knew that it was barren and without shelter   15.458370463079298
no   16.421366799154022
in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe   16.710215937644893
happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to one s self and the walls walls have ears but no tongue   14.222498404509707
inquired charles rising   11.951277158292802
he soon felt that his ideas became again collected he could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning   13.108278148106992
come he said if i pay you the 100 000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease   1.1417318484848558
felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door   14.917295308645478
do you then never appear but to act as an escort to death   10.806523982660323
i may as well blow my brains out and all will be over   10.000984810195973
asked milady   13.843512225261788
de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared   12.782230894678925
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal   10.550105584206321
the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him   11.654228971446903
that is to say patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks   14.547815841601999
your prayer is so much the more generous from your being i swear to you in the power of a man who will never pardon you   6.330676468465708
the glass is three quarters empty   6.517683685863083
he fancies he possesses an immense treasure   10.55350037155614
the duke de guise killed monsieur de coligny in the place royale and nothing was said of it   18.969519015151715
the longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca   11.939563604085501
but i have often resolved to visit them   18.051554711959298
to m   12.21100440816269
at that moment the countenance of mme   11.635623713989395
rochefort and d artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips   20.43426131303893
never   14.989098380656571
cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity   11.878056493142964
you are completely mistaken sir said monte cristo coldly who felt the perfidious manœuvre of the young man and understood the bearing of his words   8.870022636769702
bertuccio and go first   7.936902824126198
20311m he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocket book and both began for the third time to count their gold and bank notes   10.263656682651915
i faith i don t know   9.518038660535831
she will ruin us   15.71820984236527
what do you mean by having made a stiff   20.720602167963868
this event might have three causes the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majesty s guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a well furnished purse in his pocket   11.92701932216256
they are always the same   5.17838276142097
from france   6.296315888117156
you bid me adieu   13.124095853767606
prevent me then   13.502619098681798
nearly   12.31554413342495
cried andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged   14.063693661013875
by the light of one of these torches d artagnan perceived men in uniform   12.61657606156184
at one bound he was upon the duke   12.344217618946464
in the whole house said friquet   25.486160971221082
grimaud immediately obeyed   16.33456713019085
no it passed into mine   18.52805943448846
help me   13.445242072470661
chapter xiii   9.515809064987343
at length an old worm eaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of d artagnan   16.023267001140926
because i happened to be in the ante chamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance   9.463954670818152
it was fourteen years day for day since dantès arrest   12.062864916699631
this chase was however advantageous to him in one sense for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead his heart began to cool   13.589810912277422
now as d artagnan used no ceremony with aramis seeing that bazin forgot to announce him he announced himself   11.910737007204402
he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale   9.408504624311277
that will make me at least partly happy   19.111701862937597
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he can not without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money   10.654125696033915
very good resumed danglars   12.850464656582123
oh sir   9.335636948109784
and he went out   8.3556065707405
however recovering my strength and my ideas why said i should that man have carried away the corpse   12.200293975274928
true   9.707596023976128
said athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him   13.893964330999319
this is a council of state d artagnan remarked to porthos   15.9323216007632
at nine o clock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or milady pronouncing a single word   13.157467700541686
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened   18.813431640375555
chapter 87   16.067524088106513
no thank you   18.11081499448872
beware of misadventure   8.93888427073146
you will conduct us yourself then to that door   11.235750897114734
i think so   11.000009923815785
pledge it then   9.408824127131615
oh i will be revenged   14.980377741905851
as he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations the door opened and rochefort returned   13.299350122631248
you shall go to vincennes where monsieur de beaufort is confined   12.027757184617313
sang diou   11.362280405068924
and if you wish for more said porthos putting his hand to his pocket thank you sir replied raoul blushing   19.010558851091428
i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise if i would   12.732032768978273
patrick galloped off reached the duke and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited him   11.213329266217947
he has been a soldier a smuggler in fact everything   10.168104476035854
have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito   10.738043269663637
even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy gates rolled on their hinges they had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning   20.5618034794428
if it is i whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner i reply that i hold monsieur le marechal s opinion in every respect   7.887272850580454
having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the allées de meilhan belonged dantès next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth   11.531883785647278
only remember one thing a small dose is a remedy a large one is poison   7.397930752706258
then m   15.203820936072185
once more farewell my dear sister   15.503116899692854
not a word of what has passed   8.257140039526684
what do you say of that young man   14.547212808984755
that would be a schoolgirl s reason which i consider quite beneath me   17.97335050855453
yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost broken winded   5.3586918657510045
he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation   17.038693141021625
no nonsense caderousse   16.642992385122053
he gave no other name answered julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letter sinbad the sailor   9.055687105492963
it is more than ever a settled thing said lucien and considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures   15.36093767660761
as he said this he pressed grimaud s hand who seemed honored by the distinction   7.809273820193273
pray have compassion upon me and do not take up every word i say   7.77706980242699
it was then that he told me two cavaliers of the parisian army were seeking me and named the comte de la fere   12.415275324448757
upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him   13.878103426318106
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand   10.915312496676405
but meantime send for monsieur the keeper of the seals   9.922932903614969
where are we going   13.00186482860412
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket   5.871590695070689
barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him   10.613607526835851
but it is your own fault   12.044578487205449
chapter xl   5.22054734116951
be it so said the count come   13.178207421134037
whence it came no one knew and it spoke an unknown tongue   10.678849000604025
oh you know it tell them tell them   15.0425484732132
this he said to planchet must be the archbishop s chateau the abode of the fair madame de longueville   8.331363933442674
have you any suspicion of me rochefort   12.590215504550414
so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience   13.623667505335014
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs   13.212757487764504
i am quite familiar with it   8.526804327146815
cried milady   13.174294175740016
what procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against m   16.963197013342953
apropos what are the names of your friends   11.16261318688635
and what am i to do with this young gentleman   17.374008910649295
he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé s cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this   11.660012388070626
they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea   7.8696839481678404
very well   12.484410306242891
the hands were white but without delicacy   11.262766257958537
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest   11.12800953337006
he recognized albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomposed   8.824145474384965
moreover he had this advantage he was master of the count s secret while the count had no hold on franz who had nothing to conceal   15.777260355080484
2   10.904872354571076
the door immediately closed and d artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity   11.409454338402655
nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma   13.645614648735217
and now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman which faria had related to him now open sesame   15.991691674991293
the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence   12.017362326994741
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other   16.222612031721788
here i am in the heart of paris   12.201027353057853
but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say   15.781397200218171
i have not the uniform but i have the spirit   6.774553688863703
monte cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit   12.071046855488635
the tie is even more direct it seems to me   6.392704642418585
he looked around him and saw mme   15.528413252689251
but where did he find it   7.9339881025364765
it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villefort s dressing room i saw i tell you silently enter a white figure   6.505597839128469
supposing the assertion to be really true   7.843911940813476
athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned   14.146862419553392
when we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge   14.652531163400907
but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die   9.10998469791138
private interests are as nothing before the interests of all   13.654584186767622
but never mind he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time so he s welcome   4.950537204238567
good   5.641960181963979
you suspect me monsieur de rochefort   7.888576679609387
halt   5.519906897158545
chapter lxxxviii   12.491172970358088
mazarin read and construed that smile   13.22956018797478
yes sir   9.615443594543084
well don t be alarmed if i return at one two or three o clock in the morning   14.1801027491608
a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal   11.685722128156218
the same day they came for me and took me to the bastile   10.309300964512998
indeed   6.9789658029501815
monsieur mouston said d artagnan i should indeed condole with you had i not at this moment something very pressing to attend to   8.83454184184426
has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin   7.5481702564279
they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other   6.592823427539362
i think i learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued milady   14.042458442450526
yes certainly   10.330537062292747
villefort went immediately   10.242156538147928
have we ceased to be men   12.285706848149879
but why need this annoy you   12.04937863741551
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows gentlemen   10.23017402934079
another sign in the negative   11.560425079291221
and who afterwards sent the cup to me   7.277649157443886
truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate   17.245729717296555
inform the queen   18.059522304450088
the mercer s pretty wife had disappeared   18.676530537595944
exclaimed the monarch   17.602354479837768
felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall   15.501507647871566
he is now in his fifth year of captivity   20.112957005929175
it had been supposed some of the papers might be in the arabian romaic or turkish language and the interpreter of the house was in attendance   13.83391680606384
thus bassompierre who was at once protestant and catholic protestant by conviction and catholic as commander of the order of the holy ghost   18.116194450182178
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts   12.23249995694734
50209m the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the street   10.520579955624287
i do   11.408999743649176
so added he turning to renée judge for yourself if it be not important   14.001234434453874
said madame de chevreuse eagerly   14.218427519192874
25   16.276573746887188
really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions   7.218609613919333
and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of france are caused by mazarin her lover and her destroyer   11.302201945712735
then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice   19.82810914858402
if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth   12.515421791631839
calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel calculated its probable method of approach   13.615301958101725
you have despoiled me of my fortune   18.294059774883557
that was true   12.745875995028502
your wishes shall be fulfilled   14.411455704610628
milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon   0.023486889230657226
two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds   6.836522182801687
and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed   10.005781021991936
there s not a day sir that we don t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of monsieur de gassion or of monsieur de bassompierre   5.549809364785879
oh sir what are you proposing   16.590545703876437
maximilian understood him   9.422137737581451
have you any friends   16.96014600159053
d artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive   13.078226479623284
i adopt all customs speak all languages   15.525244742324833
sign the liberation of milady de winter said felton holding out a paper to the duke   12.629563347288556
with grandpapa noirtier   10.76038311447803
count she said you are i fear gained over to the court   10.184865426566436
which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of god   15.467185178425662
m   6.855571461450445
he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between m   13.361194646955166
the deuce   14.764683609920944
i thought so replied emmanuel   16.568149861796652
the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay said aramis   17.879467175211254
exclaimed d artagnan looking in astonishment at athos   15.775226484811713
repeated morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness   15.126875632460292

because it is a secret just discovered   10.924325328419032
if you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to god   6.318492402145725
in fact at half past eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawing rooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen   16.483978284689222
you know one can not change his nature he said   16.001230314894162
1   8.47104554323496
but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome   10.361476801773625
no one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman   19.2751564897644
he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human   12.673239097979176
the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner   10.29615118800098
the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction   20.40765680419237
asked his eminence   16.299505547271483
my good nanette be quiet i beseech you said broussel   4.930064479284868
but who is to make four hundred pistoles   12.120482349651208
but the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his eminence   9.846489118985094
d artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment   16.897802448601908
on a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two dice boxes and dice   14.934593070596875
but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness   11.248242324646888
you are the king of lackeys   6.710319395051769
so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again   13.203157129118413
proceed said monte cristo   10.852608662608558
impossible   11.650720452594397
what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker so fortunately become bankrupt   16.604057374062663
at dinnertime we will rouse you   21.184838738909722
monsieur de beaufort escaped   6.591854040311705
and he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors   14.14603403446237
let us go then said athos   10.896937011699226
for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences which even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes were seen to be utterly futile   13.033269001209591
therefore he has gone and i am free forever added madame danglars in the same supplicating tone   8.566211671033841
it would seem so   10.770911757377512
ah there you are marechal cried anne of austria joyfully   15.654001849118202
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majesty s voice and await the order of their captain   12.888584854058312
but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday   11.0517021291979
was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphius s rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horace a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch   12.7383353756904
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself   18.27442523807066
edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided   12.188052783151269
danglars will not fight with me i will kill his son in law   18.077567703968295
the footman went out   13.801162171418078
asked athos   13.715187968032899
hello here is my watch   9.212445099943329
he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand   16.643026204390058
take care of yourself monsieur d artagnan for from the moment i withdraw my hand from behind you i would not give an obolus for your life   12.489045996961407
it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty years of age dressed in a tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers   18.567049617618707
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal   7.224549253161233
after which they withdrew   11.248252421552793
then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures   9.02386889779891
we must not send for a notary but for a doctor   11.565582375886402
you who like ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like caliban verges on the brutal   13.59649308832039
oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing   11.747072713055765
she should have wanted nothing   16.748289855869515
and with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day d artagnan directed his course toward m   16.257994146930486

i think it charming   17.389056196325146
it was completely deserted   10.279466383930027
but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent   7.7698621769341045
a thousand thanks for your honorable company which has saved me from all the dangers to which alone i was exposed   8.857961095809717
you have my word   19.00831115232297
cried dantès letting his chisel fall to the floor   8.408268693218574
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my house   13.96726662342015
i am to wait   7.612398573250562
diavolo   15.754872881999797
i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background   5.027875353342446
it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him   17.45791616766638
valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening   1.130881937767274
planchet stopped short staring at d artagnan   8.072618996506323
he will sleep an hour   8.808331011129168
but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living   11.244510859778254
cried felton   17.15541052505829
him   9.995262256356474
what does this mean monsieur cardinal   10.666481073514044
i do signified the old man   13.253535791840186
danglars which is one of the safest banks in paris   1.6146508875270396
bonacieux had not been abed   12.977542651143901
monsieur de lillebonne lead my horse by the bridle if you please   8.286654784095445
oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things   15.94950428020941
the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court   13.69468055773941
i will not suffer it   12.847306889110817
whatever you say my dear count   8.162904762185905
how   11.670475957110643
the young men looked at each other with an expression of fear   13.370372839285984
yes said athos that s grimaud s business   16.581593032290584
on the contrary said the count after this time you must live with me you must not leave me and in a week we shall have left france behind us   7.380971081025246
they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but athos replied in excellent english that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague monsieur bridge the approach of the king   16.044753201199274
then turning to mazarin he said now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to heaven for your deliverance   12.879577160604791
poor kitty hoped to speak a few words to d artagnan when he passed through her chamber   15.526897713138904
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased   8.677105894903793
and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering   13.270122033028946
the best   10.179571311790319
by whom   2.7863666820986612
the orders came   11.16774377422959
because as i have told you it has to do with a great queen   13.568450497564573
is this the same lemonade of which you partook   10.068745486113368
more than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service   16.552595098783343
but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention   13.89831267689934
no replied the latter   13.646741621915805
monsieur the governor was all astonishment   11.65310522095147
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart   14.930054928859004
exclaimed the count   7.626388336650408
the sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words   5.166849828679096
athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him   10.937967395023527
and now said d artagnan to the governor s   11.577628803993003
madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase   10.969526313342088
this is indeed a house of mourning said valentine   10.868115799760401
to them or to us do you mean aramis   11.01895046204428
true the garden is not large   11.950595127889871
you understand me perfectly on the contrary said danglars but if you will persist i will tell you that i have just lost 700 000 francs upon the spanish loan   11.852551269902893
0087m do you indeed think so   12.56016245728719
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister   13.941036282897883
uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather   17.17784751047588
it must be aramis   9.184073515308745
well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at paris   10.749935152828044
they were placed in a wagon built on purpose and thus the sterlet lived twelve days the lamprey eight and both were alive when my cook seized them killing one with milk and the other with wine   17.904496308342683
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master   11.378261686354643
this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count   11.963082147474339
i will go   6.662169994594499
his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate   7.714380122208875
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at d artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship   13.194767536632753
the camp had entered saint omer   14.208031060151688
only it will be an infamous shame   16.290238262265085
i would not wish for a better to sail round the world   13.333621498380126
well i follow its course i track its passage   17.370942229429716
it was therefore on the footing of friends that d artagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois   6.033945495666259
the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs   16.260533618144464
so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination   17.03043229759109
he comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions   6.232676300035371
and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so   11.801475820622805
coquenard had seen everything   11.511595565757995
adieu then edmond   20.234859072651815
listen   15.229160836040238
but let it be done explicitly and positively   13.751530668791396
and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out   11.611719950570956
but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education herself   9.953426214109925
that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers   16.20415008361222
but then by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position   8.474160940517386
the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number   14.15672507268459
we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly   14.19894625404009
the officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets   8.31567624009293
quite so   7.96105115340534
stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation   15.537555113339563
on y va coming exclaimed peppino who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms   2.505649312480161
are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the rue saint denis and the rue saint antoine   7.343491041597917
the devil   16.15366744236055
it is from your father   25.2687215847655
it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion   9.324027558722236
cried anne to humble myself thus   17.31324526604498
don t you see them   16.469395367882633
he kissed it and then as he reflected that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death   9.205980904942281
said d artagnan   15.26370193336951
cried mousqueton reddening with joy   18.79853834145944
de wardes that provoked her thus   14.515948158432202
but that athos on the contrary would despise him   11.505020025850225
oh god   11.945199321087385
said he to the sailors   10.530187177154843
cried a voice from the landing   11.308913808875381
and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer   1.0530581449352514
villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child   9.097211831547426
all the crowd gave way before morrel   5.883632153238305
oh   10.833982439738834
although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity   8.94396791434743
take them   8.443950016697132
she continued when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier   12.346049102924773
oh yes said the count you are looking for the sailors   15.23328471349162
his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love   6.674449994492652
i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you   14.640056971196886
you have credit with your landlord then   18.696611736284193
every one turned around and beheld athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat   15.607548585591374
if she had committed two crimes i would say here m   5.386252194431074
capitally replied m   13.567883871055198
monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count   6.987375135839788
here is a letter which must be taken to its address   11.75181104152419
with the opera the jockey club and other diversions can you not amuse yourself   12.01327620498192
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper   16.8146218395032
bonacieux   13.565907186676641
it is you who stabbed selim   9.592982429469256
it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m   13.943291781527991
what does this mean   10.66267468157377
what   20.38448974674888
but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count   9.50082745269186
come speak my worthy corsican speak   10.019328868838533
we dress the king in groslow s clothes   10.929212787061052
in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us   18.61559420768065
each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lackey   7.036553722715616
the unknown day for which dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned   10.68268440873935
have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it   5.488362871146416
in passing before d artagnan he recognized his former master   11.763268332159887
i wish to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish   16.93644717506925
the fact is mademoiselle said barrois i am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me i can not say i should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it   15.239562587210958

ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation   11.423405487566832
colonel fairfax repeated bradshaw   2.8194837092542233
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse   9.08931806270602
he has gone said he and the house door is shut   9.24498587107177
well young man said he we appear to pass rather gay nights   7.194183479238516
wait wait   7.92365110285637
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence   4.387973319545077
are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain   15.051955524103779
by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct   12.122641144828878
you are not boasting   15.140472528823206
call for me at eight o clock or shall i wait supper for you at seven   14.568527795757133
for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone   7.465645199761686
and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mother s side at least and a baroness in right of her father i will help you in the search   5.692527489631797
in the house in which the judicial inquiry was made continued the impassive cardinal there lodges i believe a young béarnais a friend of the musketeer   8.297327667439598
perhaps   11.000006879417171

they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse   17.207414150941872
he approached and soon recognized the coachman   6.186958930500128

cried d artagnan   11.391488652214276
the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered   9.82254461413501
and during its progress the count of morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of madame danglars   13.830771302393188

and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said debray   14.197832051955237
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined d artagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal guitant and the rest of the escort   16.49178851095648

oh i am a christian cried dantès guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him   12.079812240886012
and that man what has your eminence done with him   4.209644060790667
all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stock jobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow   6.5411823943230125
i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist   18.054946391897797

we can not say how long the night seemed to milady but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness   15.104236776939594
he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen   28.674911984409814
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door   8.34186909407869

we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard   15.905772731176079
at this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor   18.025879523640615
however difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished him   16.22753098654203
it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us   9.408703714494273

the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé s ladder of cords   12.620815955556807
later said athos   10.853588246616484

her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied mazarin   7.383259291049371
he stood badly with the liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists   11.224347326963024
then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison   18.287058323354913
grimaud   14.756146469100042
d artagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud   13.675694546763559
at that instant the little side gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared   9.82396549086775
you will not oppose m   6.5980593498762525
you have suffered a great deal sir   12.60569966257704

yes i think i received a flower pot upon my head   6.045095372701467
but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard   11.334588884625221
poor king charles   10.395284247390377
you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20 000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us   5.068996237477971
d artagnan pretended astonishment   18.319605031907855
we have had a narrow escape   16.85259057449539
ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host thereupon   7.036908782409312
and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars   13.449228306218647
oh i can not go without taking leave of her   17.984316726643353

madame these conferences will bring us peace   9.422584010892493
and what is your opinion   10.591282836379172
caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly pale   11.063209508245349
he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference   11.80118290558768
that of my betrothed was stay stay continued the abbé i have forgotten what he called her   10.507902594105728
i beg you to return me that dispatch   16.890232408992965
but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out to night for paris   7.660145524233506
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission athos for generosity is a hero of romance   9.581568885316235
she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after   9.655443306647474
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere have i not obeyed   24.573758240491404
chatillon and flamarens looked at each other   8.25667030263178
she was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her hands   12.26495311565531
while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole left hand corner of the cellar and a tun the cock of which was left running was yielding by this means the last drop of its blood   19.916338170972605
asked beauchamp   19.571505524336242
are you very anxious to know countess   16.27754660397258
himself monsieur bernouin   18.707872276684245
beauchamp was in his bath   10.290310620233955
we shall be safer there than in the doorway   21.410809302476814
it is unnecessary for you to understand   10.345572093127933
that completes the 250 000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains   15.147236839083956
it is what i have just reproached you for   13.568340486704159
monsieur man in a hurry you can find me without running me you understand   17.098403629076643
oh i am free then i am saved   6.7623667628472415
my dear count we have only just begun   14.485582990657509
the barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of titian s portraits   8.41049729555216
and what will he promise us   6.441808919331558
she was said to have a weak chest and like antonia in the cremona violin she would die one day while singing   11.21719931312344
come finish your cup of coffee said monte cristo   9.260692901818349
yes but the son has done us no harm   10.737139136725418
it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes   11.56650150723689
but this letter in which he recommends you to me   13.017024751996107
and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared   12.947553976988994
m   12.856577027104233
oliver cromwell   16.66435958158405
i know it because yesterday monsieur de wardes in a saloon where i was showed a ring which he said he had received from you   10.944136578192694
six hundred   9.957065359949414
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way   9.840855057220343
i have already answered that question in the affirmative   14.905840585161723
yes you must   18.033113704071052
here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner   7.408357764413314
but this creature must be a demon   4.328569918454826
he was there   9.120578652150854
yes   3.6592908490518194
yes   17.40715985165757
one moment yes answered the queen   7.325549215863817
namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly   15.764940619625683
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury   6.067664502852152
did you not yet know me   13.635608673478737
the devil   12.00463633845336
i was tutor to his nephews who are dead   19.499803151977705
that is replied the jeweller i offered 40 000 francs   7.216304883521417
said la ramee scratching his head   9.273058604073197
fatality   16.008103391036116
at least i hope not   9.812695711633854
on my word said the inspector in a low tone had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad i should believe what he says   11.64538043259542
besides even you didn t recognize me   9.70357924231709
that is another thing said porthos   17.797106057663964
you have promised me to go said the queen   14.303376932436072
well   14.682872523639046
false   10.135606100352636
and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe free   7.3811932833318235
on foot yes in a carriage no   11.212730960268205
father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room   12.532577027991262
not the least in the world replied bonacieux   7.669507208344183
but why all these precautions   0.8840494131261778
at nine o clock the contract is to be signed at my father in law s   9.68370893287636
her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity   4.215817833171875
probably   7.691525869389184
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet   16.618029092899263
and then he added in a low voice tell your master that his eminence is very well disposed toward him and that his fortune perhaps depends upon this interview   6.644642351540485
what are you going to do   9.74713093478358
oh dear no your excellency   9.985249837711121
at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a man s stout and furious thundered behind d artagnan   13.442035511681933
the thunder growled in the distance   14.503227503423187
this i do not comprehend   10.997025950333313
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you   9.757400105243356
de tréville a long history about the queen   2.8638924952945075
yes sir he had very good ones   16.118144102060587
you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan with chagrin   10.78373076221188
but do not do not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and constrained   12.424096056403755
mordaunt   13.412164267695141
let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off   5.020843303967045
ah that is true said de guiche   7.956583837837932
but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first   9.404699511699283
said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by d artagnan and porthos   4.159792662140394
what would your excellency like   15.007330364836905
yes   6.551858197848411
oh   16.84293008937173
1   10.577369322037107
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report   12.19253218801423
coquenard   9.730699736857558
i have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend   14.889483139694093
just so replied aramis   13.151034205057943
the others my lord   10.339763110187828
in short i see you to tell you that we must never see each other again   18.291412479848294
then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do   10.257380407240897
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open d artagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid   15.370586883111987
but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly   11.756964037644464
just now   15.19880448656072
and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule   10.031821118029285
aramis cried athos i am arrested   10.397993319604588
four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis   14.879368178376552
d artagnan it is wrong thus to neglect your friends particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time   10.35790483060034
two months and a half elapsed in these trips and edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman   11.73062882397029
but it appears to me that my guards mine are also his majesty s guards   24.920888285951442
don t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess   15.46623837591799
do you take me for half a woman   14.420647979369177
comminges immediately left the church and entered the rue saint christophe   7.744025516235571
are you fond of horses count   11.875701670209404
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor general is no other than count fernand of morcerf   12.55482012254853
the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son   2.3326195772990435
the thirty two that we shall use tonight are its progeny   13.027313387314901
one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and tréville next or even perhaps before himself   15.760690460673352
chapter lxxv   13.612516253492203
well   8.677803258116725
where can you find them then   12.424461947370903
asked the notary   11.306294799735518
said she in a hollow voice   14.837866291349998
but the march of those who remained was not slackened   12.462629889904907
i have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled down   18.385352295528847
and what have you done with your ecclesiastics   18.595547035298768
adieu gentlemen   12.024676600097434
at these words madame morrel rose and threw herself into her son s arms   7.8959521766395415
bonacieux   12.84092584879696
ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied franz which will make it still more difficult   14.598439504949617
cried porthos and aramis in a breath   7.056183889167246
while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared   15.694751619161286
then the court once safe i might be forgotten   16.884301005324268
to the king   16.927548713004423
albert entered   10.034367029074994
where were you placed   8.88871743591449
monte cristo motioned him to be silent   9.87469646741122
germain   17.986471500729746
impossible   19.660210781635932
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family   17.05238304296846
you will bring him then   8.061735570505487
and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent   14.496851311455337
sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be   18.719563758998422
first and foremost dear d artagnan we have no title such as count here   7.240444422991154
and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts   13.825939900877648
he had not even a knitting needle   12.040379990076895
if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thing a shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with ear rings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies   17.406219110640237
that is what we must find out returned gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star   7.312530884219866
her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger   10.30425041077208
demons do not die so easily   13.181671373130573
he made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside him   8.818508291117238
de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees   18.9292037679217
i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger   10.6026735911455
bernouin re entered the cabinet returning in a few seconds   19.48393033379874
i am at your service my lord   9.18372776509707
and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself   17.251265888937834
if the supreme being has directed the fatal blow said emmanuel it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment   11.033041075686917
tis true my lord answered la ramee that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent   18.169019706854186
did you come to noisy to defend him   17.71300792258708
he had reserved from his annuity his family papers his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary   8.888738410439668
the former executioner of bethune   5.641251010255042
suddenly he felt an arm thrown around his body and a well known voice behind him exclaimed father dear father   11.52947321657382
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me   9.660217482136584
i feel myself quite in a humor for it   12.553434221270068
we will judge you in spite of your silence   18.109830524129336
cried the king taking up tréville s words police affairs   20.62385566369042
scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly   11.363214542660408
what   9.037655763144972
but then we are lodged as you perceive   4.492851503946847
come gentlemen said he they are beating the tattoo   8.753584669109681
is it not a halt in death s anteroom   18.98529559312822
oh there was no harm meant answered danglars   14.827412942619192
she seemed however by certain signs to recognize a door and approaching that door and now monsieur said she it is here i have business   16.900623599755445
this evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate   16.725937287904067
well i hoped to get an exchange of arms to substitute the sword for the pistol   16.439595892972296
i now believe in italian banditti   17.083017244233083
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal   13.160310323388686

yes for you who detest those unhappy princes beauchamp and are always delighted to find fault with them   11.26808957529497
de villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic and one of the softest and most brilliant days of september shone forth in all its splendor   20.41426582724037
that would be useless   13.060539530241735
is the countess up yet   17.94791346011411
i have heard speak of a mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question   10.527446302095715
i mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion   6.60910185646104
ah indeed   14.451207174606616
the review over the guards set forward alone on their march the musketeers waiting for the king which allowed porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the rue aux ours   14.260572715487017
one hour s rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man s bright anticipations   12.71593749018971
yes said porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two   7.1896130127978495
does he regret me a little   3.3297828280620685
said d artagnan   14.416684870031803
our position is truly a strange one continued athos laughing   14.27180941360329
i am saved   12.083931035068966

did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saint méran has fallen a victim   5.204010751663501
does she come to borrow money of me   14.25328379924932
oh my god   6.0426756342237935
said porthos   15.566803461192215
yes i inherited this little property when i quitted the army as i told you   5.432924525473879
impossible doctor   15.849054621010032
for when crime enters a dwelling it is like death it does not come alone   13.909902037231799
grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence   9.71834034158034
but what name can you give it what name will the lord give it if i am innocent   11.186230695947758
and the swords crossed   11.240885549015758
and lastly because i fancied i had found my cæsar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me   10.499155363869882
enough enough   2.9385152869960365
the novice seeing milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior   7.451762685622445
bazin who had always been inclined to devotion never quit the churches   9.318775533700265
richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect   11.903492373907511
all minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language   6.841238991613114
of bethune   10.266560680339776
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness   8.960260403551938
bonacieux and if she was returning to paris why this fugitive rendezvous why this simple exchange of a glance why this lost kiss   3.0912197610166636
all this she owes to d artagnan without doubt   12.77618072147807
it is theology in verse   10.826963598137745
i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome   8.626826506700066
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner   13.803251390072449
well don t you intend to bring me another plate   17.094736540323353
rinse the glasses said grimaud   15.196007089821421
then gloom settled heavily upon him   12.26913866355049
fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised   5.9500429340258325
and people are wrong d artagnan   11.729750092321966
perhaps i shall stand in need of a back door for retreat   15.91890431739729
as for porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them   10.807498802414738
but you general were you not at whitehall   13.103103862258923
yes indeed   15.125781309252954

i have seen milady   7.196089886287649
my dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box   9.102649327283187
albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick   14.973796231513333
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information   7.0246173106422045
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes   10.778719477028137
they jumped into the ditch and prepared to scale the breach   11.849985470354323
and the moment the door closed they have seen each other   14.737361776045299
there is now a truce and a conference   5.559448155758031
the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of her amorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her   11.970559840404945
yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation lord de winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future conduct   18.850109071096558
yes i see too plainly that it does exist   17.43642690022944
yes have you breakfasted   12.063374976797435
mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry long live mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on porthos   10.852955754540863
i see it and i thank you for it   19.40428390823459
i do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king   22.58054392261063

the comte de la fere   11.561830392024158
so after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply la ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud   12.139396381460093
it is in fact magnificent said andrea   10.119303506676207
luigi slowly relinquished teresa s arm which he had held beneath his own and teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille   16.728450712244154
you see   13.360044297147954
she is going to leave her house said the steward   12.260723404011054
a cavalier richly dressed was close to the door   12.015803306209103
it is owing to him that we are free   15.076434887231057
this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that i wish to belong to the church and that i avoid all mundane opportunities   11.758476271680815
by general oliver cromwell   5.4421483667866
monsieur de flamarens   7.161673290679369

she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocket mirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible   12.260487283039058
yes yes they all said at once   11.546006015166551
he exclaimed   22.005427652452966

but wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet   12.867645909325585
this time my determination is irrevocably taken   15.388313357895361
he had taken revenge on mazarin and had aided in his father s deliverance from prison   8.22530724815964
but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered   13.78036809516152
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit   10.806208595775377
he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is monsieur mordaunt   10.913794440892884
de tréville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become darker   15.730284652532305
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor s answer   16.358777214086107
this affair does not then weigh upon your conscience   3.933297760330344
yes said aramis i saw her also at that time   11.605624200904863

oh what is the matter   6.16356882314815
i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends   12.086830283361348
besides i am the person punished as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis at least   6.977870035776024
and who thinks of using him ill   10.628896182805319
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied   11.118230301147078
in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me   10.751288260533297
it is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you   14.357652258517945
hush   7.674438109275117
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay   11.280114640069069
that s what his adversary met with   13.781428858961021
having passed through the rue du mont blanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the rue la fayette   10.64403402938676
i don t know him   10.289088157011387

and imperceptibly d artagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper   14.284496028671992
we shall arrive at eight o clock   14.91489447928352
grimaud speaks   8.936171581384908
very well   12.56615106898304
one can do it   8.18730449683294
a sword for example richly embossed which belonged by its make to the times of francis i the hilt of which alone encrusted with precious stones might be worth two hundred pistoles and which nevertheless in his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for sale   7.60639785910414
you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us   7.541472086140693
oh   9.627770098827668
this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day   11.961016956321743

he will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body   11.437278670246952
my guards exclaimed that they were sure of it   8.946124742206688
at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before   19.16092735408008
towards the louvres   11.160989964695403
here in an hour   10.50705356397434
i do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me   4.6095753370955235
once outside he and planchet set off as fast as they could   12.236072225018185
add to that d artagnan s rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him   10.195969678395848

the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with d artagnan   13.654419531653389
no   12.848309437601054
he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed   15.435158753316177
at this moment m   15.646963072399954
alas   6.42031048639152
planchet two hours before had asked his master for some dinner and he had answered him with the proverb he who sleeps dines   10.127237671502538
well madame i perceive i must do as you wish   5.828934740181025
d artagnan was really insulted   12.772985860848204

cried d artagnan finishing his friend s sentence   5.485628340217203
he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper   11.159960198418082
at that age he can not be a traitor   12.899215737456588
my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes   10.038011886854694
albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes   14.063308863242774
well well dandré said louis xviii   9.66262935712568
he will treat me better the next time i see him   12.09101098050489
oh i am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller   19.406444445338693
he shall go thither   8.204701546067765
why that s as long as the almighty took to make the world   12.978272364887763
s   8.7830340932507
monsieur the coadjutor s carriage   10.864394047406893
athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read dec   15.229652321821389
i do not want it said the old man   4.566135250786315
but you are sure you are not mistaken   13.25444012561054
the skiff lightning   13.465969047561481
stay   10.145466712097178
your excellency has 5 050 000 francs in your pocket   5.828992024394742
yes yes my lord   18.30007074722821
you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions   13.404637858435954
in gold silver or notes   13.653649596541506
i know it well so take grimaud   14.98133406397848
asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation   6.988495956148595
toward the town of louvres was the reply   7.446464414194544
ah continued caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the south the world grows worse and worse   13.627207009206831
certainly neither i nor fernand said danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner   15.187616271575529
at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened   5.273275184715867
raoul bent his knee to the ground   4.572648428794485
sit down in mercy   8.220947061086187
in the meantime the king finished his toilet   19.668238347455265
and do you comprehend grimaud   8.594426506299216
cried the cardinal astonished   4.093961266733416
yes said he   11.14797325574796
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenant s sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak   13.446607830136925
as happy as possible   16.120817986047875
apropos when do you aspect m   11.575055582588497
said he   5.274317436655263
why so planchet   6.811229663495287
at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken   15.281019502966835
a charming woman   7.181701575707583
leave you   16.67297350701012
she told me to wait and i waited   16.784783996831706
if his mistress abandons him he will find friends i will answer for it   11.23727784726295
would not m   15.468217972200144
that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought   9.083081802960558
i married   18.58894532498968
you mean to say you have been freed from confinement   9.469115653879289
said caderousse emptying his glass here s to his health   13.753364548577498
madame uttered fresh sighs   16.78583338388961
all paris were in the streets   11.380223267607196
in the clover fields beyond the chestnut trees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning song   10.955897146531303
d avrigny took the young man s arm and led him out of the room   20.01728816483029
the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron gray horse   11.555988671154273
the young count s conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long   12.263816895245427
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin   17.554150417427486
e   7.413852597150517
i know nothing about it   11.558911860782974
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped   15.530265179952876
have you not said that that abduction was entirely political   7.615980393286513
but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers   8.480394828794456
what is this rent   17.35085030647755
asked the officer   19.7430382749545
mazarin again   8.182031488346198
with these four elements paris is ours in a week   10.453341220728973
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet   11.792499881810606
what   11.535022620529725
and that worthy monsieur du vallon are we not to enjoy his society   13.455274739375266
the last commission of poor captain leclere   10.313072755676217
the gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart   9.819811216469759
were the following lines which i can never forget the great wars of romagna had ended   17.66860890011355
well i wait patiently do i not   10.90362476062095
raoul began the examination but the result justified his opinion   12.840948189978047
god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune   13.643690680087003
but your mother   17.705083051870908
i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5 000 francs   12.25452854952043
count albert   17.79079063881276
you don t comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me   15.446871901128558
procureur   13.283982974960367
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself   15.914154909612726
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity   12.841101984099978
his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same   11.762179019327462
come fanny we will put her to bed   11.00728333932134
how do you do madame dantès   11.15931769304953
you were asleep you are fatigued   13.0787515907445
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude   13.374820863196648
everything considered you are very well off here   12.366203320643923
but yet i do live   1.1320490858606114
what the devil are you going to do   13.65123305098468
ah madame said monte cristo you should not talk thus   9.586338381764524
and this room   6.47940708591499
milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward d artagnan   14.604788944799035
so i think replied d artagnan   12.439198111808782
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed   17.952517498390215
on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure   12.477839243496119
the traveler made a sign of assent   13.44741813456032
yes madame it is the custom not from gallantry but prudence that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular hôtels in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them   12.255418787699606
so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character   17.93057386488583
he found edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless   17.455680179847633
porthos you are as vain as narcissus   5.775108758834809
he is a very rich englishman eccentric almost to insanity and his real name is lord wilmore   12.304447969788042
everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity   13.960117457724813
ah my dear fellow excuse me   17.54422610047923
no doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre and would be allowed to pass   11.806429757689587
you will take their places and i shall not lose by the exchange   11.694355446355615
but in going out he put the knife into his bosom   8.098553655226112
no   7.626771413380949
he was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his hand   9.120150560205555
and what do you suppose is the count s age   6.107950188692074
fernand rose impatiently   14.655585491662546
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant   16.72319430341225
while the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound milady s hands together   13.927826836056868
queen forsooth   13.783714539765729
yes said he   16.52598240773049
to wait   14.388055261187631
you may make your mind easy said the doctor   11.766141110993557
albert was right   7.117554621976625
can it be   12.018750506705736
ten times as i told you he came to see dantès father and offered to receive him in his own house   10.67230955632244
what wounded man   2.428527054174351
d artagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at half past nine o clock he entered the ante room   11.051139013281698
exclaimed baptistin eagerly   14.801303446223915
you know said the abbé that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada the last of the princes of that name   10.332225006408471
the friend of madame de villefort   15.953790359578829
i will facilitate it by repeating the question will you or will you not retract   15.88445296465461
you love me   11.428631594972593
exclaimed mazarin   16.381722694605322
you will be wise to do so   11.030240045268089
i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or man s countenance is no longer to be relied on   0.9535560543314876
but please to observe i won back the equipage cried athos   13.458585554033924
hers had been accomplished   8.223969453724475
the second was the man s conventional abode or rather sleeping place   8.334659995188566
the devil   5.10666945521325
i embrace you with all my heart   15.90451020081031
that is not all sir continued mazarin   16.124626187750017
he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood   17.67151534112269
asked beauchamp   12.28455561220435
hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself   12.905038567837726
i live retired in the house of my noble protector but i do it from choice   18.698760674438226
you are perhaps a tulip fancier   7.988839153322425
murmured the voice   9.84757713172245
perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed   16.719263884195293
tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me outright   8.003443199090643
i beg pardon interrupted beauchamp   15.428239740684345
and cheerfully would i give up five years of my pay which i am never paid by the way to make the king five years older   7.095628490647743
my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us   7.236008305735226
you have a sword by your side i have one in my cane   10.564773826250008
i present my letter from the queen to the superior and i bring back the dear treasure i go to seek not into lorraine not into belgium but to paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at la rochelle   17.19161300658177
de villefort followed them   16.164911152425496
add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him   14.093147243588604
then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franche comte   9.097693020778298
now for my idea   17.52036843748235
asked valentine   4.359049871506486
ried in a place he knows and has visited with me that is in   12.242417462033739
it is his voice   3.6110084151196773
said porthos haughtily   7.001380521285542
and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture   7.108171146932202
ah   10.606883123233466
see look at fernand and follow his example   9.52473042872128
opposite the tower of london he found the vessel that had been named to him delivered his letter to the captain who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to sail   18.978430395920793
andrea drew the garden the court and the house   10.438690599423337
the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand in whom the grand vizier ali tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence   12.681356094261032
and so i came added caderousse as fast as i could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend   15.334043743297046
but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was non capisco   10.130746422967587
said the concierge   16.100475073186413
thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover s arm   0.19096347184910378
and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain   10.919612706621281
monte cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens   11.267871163667722
athos smiled   14.282049281320399
only one thing said the italian   5.717431235098063
said d artagnan   11.023090559871827
and what do you believe   15.888629769335221
d artagnan made kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following morning   11.445228589178155
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words   18.273731531916212
how does that concern you   11.527748576295707
i don t understand you bazin   13.027998924736565
i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such   12.337017163018453
she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named teresa   11.34417564019875
in that case i can give you proofs   12.794855234342311
andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie started up like a jack in the box   13.414874678100908
he had made up his mind to write to her the next day   9.463857604189203
he then rose and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness   7.383478031092973
you have a charming young person with you tonight count said eugénie   10.928362803930696
faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it   9.610177244198741
the young man smiled sorrowfully   19.75194450530988
the one i have hired for you   20.66001296109507
haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver   11.2072125668001
tis true   12.941281650498352
you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my child s room   5.486310949843389
certainly replied the count are we not in carnival time   10.014271121248566
la ramee s mouth watered and he returned to the duke s chamber rubbing his hands   8.59135647251837
i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue   17.042556107974942
who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one   12.80960663426448
no for it would be useless   7.845227597625405
each retired to his own apartment   12.726671134199941
indeed the last three days some odd adventures have happened but what is the matter   10.352883308216871
it s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young cavalcanti whom i do not really know at all   26.105021678833644
go up said the host   20.069180583328937
said athos   10.880427877239413
he arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before mercédès with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched say mercédès he said once for all is this your final determination   8.05270003297814
the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease   18.595872978603175
one step farther into rest two perhaps into silence   4.538346620561586
then from the bench she went to the gate   7.239479108429999
i mean that miserable d artagnan   14.251798076553436
anne was caught she could not draw back she signed   18.25577608039766
it matters not   13.361508643943965
said buckingham looking at felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them   7.595999776541361
adieu then and be of good courage said athos   7.20136424556152
hush   9.606842650265024
gutenberg   20.193781302253605
and he glanced timidly at the count s blue coat   16.40994420476052
you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to do   3.107660595392888
while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels   19.18478739491345
we are listening   18.55462763507255
your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount   5.486672780351562
the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for   5.163371924925815
look at her still beautiful witty more charming than ever   12.976039346713053
when he had finished he said my mistress said she should expect you sir as soon as you had finished dressing   11.064624495801377
how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten   6.5076326463475125
yet i let him die   17.88370716628702
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count   5.308478752994406
well go and fetch them and come to my apartment   11.009273652653269
the man who lives to see shall see   13.694828748225243
but she is built to stand any weather   10.651563317805994
he darted from the room followed by the count   14.349304370535526
it was thus and by mere accident may god pardon me if i blaspheme that he heard the confession of the executioner of bethune   7.636829061322821
and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist   8.485140910983214
it was then that d artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it   13.423775975891687
cried raoul swimming on   12.581807920016288
a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort   19.658347074481917
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen   6.2643667542468915
said the tutor joining in the conversation   13.66413733385152
i want all my household at auteuil   20.209936929475308
two open   11.002441258342403

olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword   13.79190621909419
villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught   13.229063735071911
you know how much the queen loves dancing   9.705740483410311
but he sank down again immediately   13.966458915733071
and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him   13.035338852283921
make yourself easy my friend replied the abbé   14.215935372688325
and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoled you the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power   17.442071766850127
demanded andrea   13.337291244074704
he struck thrice   13.625323941449432
i expected as much said athos   14.172573752458021
hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it   13.184510795847226
yes and that s all settled   14.312331052446847
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions   9.454044545305587

oh i consider her perfectly lovely she is just my idea of what medora must have been   6.909238970541494
as bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back   15.070980317462409
morrel looked at him in utter amazement   15.030466812303802
at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with a loud voice this verse in jeremiah god said hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom i have sent unto you   4.764542080164663
said d artagnan   11.97907481943236
indeed   9.393652895724525
the young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself   15.325895032325088
but milady remarked that this time felton did not accompany the soldiers   6.260887404809248
grandpapa noirtier can speak now then said edward with his habitual quickness   15.822602676008964
they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously   18.453283998105796
he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant   16.2711326066905
now sir continued morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like valentine   10.278851354234057
yet this catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards sicilians and calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow   7.242499849528692
no replied mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm   12.590767063919708
planchet all astonishment was busy grooming them and had already finished two   15.853238222357469
planchet said d artagnan i am going out for all day perhaps   8.358582570026865
andrea turned pale and drew towards the door   12.49237237381884
we can now part   9.633888895002908
they could willingly have strangled m   13.600605875163343
then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me   5.211661126245124
there the aspect changed   10.745363885407741
for the dead man yes replied m   12.600024219523828
you have friends left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the liberty i hasten to restore to you   7.842680510204983
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her   15.708827852234643
wait a moment   10.560664706571071
the stranger met julie on the stairs   10.338789385597313
give me my felt hat bernouin   8.908542596734227
sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary   11.971080427822828
well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends   10.733944376212692
the cardinal repressed a smile   10.71999712421498
i believe with your majesty that monsieur de tréville s guarantee is more than sufficient   17.260224593992742
thanks m   9.295835108067832
athos lifted his finger and grimaud was silent   5.981753421734406
ah   9.182109270888198
but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison   13.075606693988078
they set out on vulcan and bayard followed by mousqueton on phoebus and arrived at the palais royal at about a quarter to seven   15.950751360320956
hush said andrea   10.790086110806532
he is and he is not replied athos   8.469714733928782
i think i have discovered my father   10.77770149447096
in gastronomy   8.416985956129153
and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3 000 francs   10.26280158394805
morrel unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m   15.593431272875703
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great lady for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass   13.369954561038757
i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest   12.960401559953176
the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise   17.244345843139786
come and sit down close to me said milady   16.155641476877857
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo   11.909250225020122
perhaps i am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to mazarin   14.61640407317342
d artagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked for nothing had led him to the examination that the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and horses   9.961817583974065
but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person   6.3323435027449735
then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister   15.704362072448578

i am still beautiful   13.947912773981253
cried the king   14.72605937018022
morrel smiled and shook his head   13.530900894942773
you were among them you were   15.236146825441473
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault   15.884981222285308
what has happened then   4.682442139412558
the carmelite convent at béthune chapter lxii   4.651095031784119
an old proverb says like master like man   5.402668182875154
and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle   15.49894195876907
the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the half closed teeth   11.274046249769327
no count   11.080823498342259
rich   9.54641150860987

d artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handkerchief   7.085645924464133
really   12.243127492246346
i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de villefort   11.064384596912248
meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of   19.127937749372176
and her name is countess g   10.280204612319395
at nine o clock the night had fully come   15.906856912066662
no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of   10.098365842769146
because in truth albert you hesitate   16.62558215805135
but suppose they come unarmed   7.555678882981706
unlimited credit about two o clock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his features a person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron and directed his groom to inquire at the porter s lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there and if he were within   11.150931469518513
he saw a little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in everything except drawing a sword and firing a pistol with something haughty and contemptuous in his face   11.342406524192361
the same   12.5292133382551
you have deceived me   7.336964643329708
murmured the cardinal   8.956677912951005
explain yourself my lord replied the prisoner with majesty   8.290189279060119
yes   5.636438317715048
don t make a bad use of it i entreat you   16.21179153078732
yet i must know his name   18.097278174842323
what sort of person is this count of monte cristo   11.121789026406894
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot   11.372479550716019
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity   16.69357365077362
come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel   14.367827248331864
you were not expected   9.199641817473006
two long hours he waited in terrible inaction   13.539794372431599
i answered in greece   9.49804766497047
ah captain   17.389238183778843
well well   7.443518913314156
his chin had joined his throat   18.310932616910414
now m   13.83134633618782
very well cried d artagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge   19.280974457952603
athos talked of the discretion of grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth   20.52213363150135
the young man s trembling voice was scarcely audible   14.74477792771904
sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law   11.419056995729045
they had seen no one   13.788660953777944
it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the hôtel des postes when chance brought us together   8.283487999988246
may i be permitted to inform my wife   13.155105429146854
pshaw   11.610870425864224
but of what then does the equipment of your company consist monsieur porthos   18.780278759393752
five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to danglars house   17.332649040818847
work slowly said the curate   14.411611091629739
you appear to be an honest young man and i will have confidence in you   15.432236299996038
therefore i shall not get into a passion with them   13.917853788068813

she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care   15.802047706206672
he has seen him said athos in a low tone to aramis   7.5662191028324175
yes yes everything for him   8.788902894797955
these horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as cavaliers   9.38929060577306
it is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery   9.772841416336016
i simply told them where you were   10.91147750155005
oh sir twenty five years   12.41211989816586
at this moment laporte reappeared   13.422879811454523
said aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarging   8.811617237153488
he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment   7.145581053132154
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing   13.789121091245063
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen   12.611235167528125
i offered you tyburn said lord de winter   13.031198969107484
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on   11.883237465138333
grimaud bazin mousqueton and planchet   12.466059938455729
and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles   9.741216924510205
then you were going to rueil   17.57909919877177
what do you say athos to that proposition   19.563899895636403
why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a hay cart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierre s bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things   15.397251282611212
when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation   9.546443798934174
yes   10.897004125633266
from london   10.210241670301683
after ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten   8.567453175956162
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed   11.729117006287431

the procurator s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse   11.450276731383969
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation   14.23109542247878
when will it take place   11.24793954253678
well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain   12.147501583546564
tell them said morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that i am her betrothed   11.45452528316047
what do you say of him   12.944498597839338
besides the end justified the means as you frenchmen say does it not   4.07978479784574
the friends obeyed   15.118191491487895
in what a tone you speak   15.655665392808102
like jupiter they like to cross the race   11.78129091146559
lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him   9.488594520415699
but tell me said beauchamp what is life   9.696990418465937
i should like to have seen his face at that moment   12.512035317458313
well sir what you tell me is impossible   7.627748663548592
the prince smiled   12.338617517165376
i was in utter darkness   10.821629158107381
but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves   7.333115813875263
i will go down   9.925306392052212
in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves   19.128010980534455
that is unfortunate returned monte cristo   13.5471967484664
s   17.30715595709046
no replied athos with a singular smile   14.24836654403159
it is not the same with you and me you can not have made the same resolution i have for i have come to warn you that i bid adieu to your house and and to you   11.896282026579277
but d artagnan whose anger already excited was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos caught at his bridle and stopped him   15.606110961527913
down with the officer   6.566619750006541
he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him   3.8333089606581137
tis a matter of conscience with them as with us   15.037955731570172
on every occasion i have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and i have preserved lives in exchange for that i took away   11.310646102702494

the dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saint denis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station   4.886699851504058
made a peer at the restoration i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal bourmont   10.620554223945547
said mazarin i have been proving it to you this last hour   10.84636904217615
that i can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word   15.231568334024383
he bolted them both   16.24025014020104
sleep well your last night as citizen   9.841796702073069
but my lord if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall i reply   5.84041095118658
monsieur d artagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns   12.470125513777132
fine sport   6.716290775305089
and he presented to dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which edmond read as follows   10.350041353331115
comminges who was on guard that night at the palais royal ran in   9.910760166857141
cried the monk   10.481973307964912
nobody knows you   19.055540338292385
i fear i am committing a great imprudence   8.384341190781782
he knows her brother in law   12.42354499626585
i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the hôtel and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor   6.766807535574274
a surgeon   12.609721819368056
you are a fool m   15.97007990033071
d artagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him   18.625536770484032
then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open ledger   18.30477618646736
indeed everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance   10.534963265961839
impossible   11.905231942805237

what would you have planchet   8.84238912105753
milady looked around her as if in search of something   15.780523511180405

your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves   16.691792141735778
for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun   15.403977472318562

d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard   22.57776664660081

dantès took the hand of the abbé in his and affectionately pressed it   10.881732527075638
tis an unfortunate year for kings said the mother   13.651647231659457
in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust   12.88730916986938
he said   8.930039672836532
how much were your animals worth porthos   17.697497657179294

and if i deceive you bring me here again i ask no more   18.559168414007157
buckingham remained nearly a year absent   8.486882047092465
and taking it from felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it   7.625343826807208
each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion   9.687836538536544
of whom i bought her said monte cristo as i told you albert with the emerald which formed a match to the one i had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills   12.697792846435132

he followed m   3.8529881617042943
i wish them to be promulgated immediately   13.756574891461698
three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded   9.583470698871283
athos and aramis looked at each other   11.236889246717517
her brother   19.012703239366957
he will not come in time   16.109490278845048
and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time   14.225224095029375
poor danglars looked so crest fallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air towards him   5.958728231744033
1   7.379580932448402
but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view   16.586097618920316
truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing   8.25788908418555
and i am like you i want capital   11.05548804896445
now to apply it in your case to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable   6.876952505061619
what could be his intentions towards him   5.246198419317173
and at these words the musketeer in irreproachable costume belted as usual with a tolerably firm step entered the cabinet   10.365360035181574
biribi   15.588980492240673
aramis smiled   15.321574868438603
because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return   15.305785635478129
as to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found shut   10.916579960636108
this man your highness when he saw me stop before his shop where he has a display of things which would make your mouth water my lord asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the donjon   10.161635625481933
that is possible said the countess reflecting   12.686345801005173
it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near   8.629863599428688
i was born for a diplomatist   10.758898369217214
he then began to ascend the path   18.549351710974605
thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped   16.677408508767613
misfortune refreshes the memory   6.826159762382065
none sir   15.722652576898872
we must do him justice he had had a great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them   9.702654725082892
interrupted valentine   11.160698405849852
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set   16.13214400893843
he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort   11.343553359735441
said athos in a low tone to d artagnan after explaining to him in french what the sailor had said in english   12.4848933158795
noirtier s eye was fixed on the dictionary   7.29254266885894
toward eleven o clock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court   11.1930714337424
but they believe i am shut up alone here   8.891536748693692
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention   8.864982930782382
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child   3.280287252930929
porthos arrived a minute after d artagnan   5.598444457223766
why you must see your excellency cried the steward that this is not natural   14.394255228551852
we have an instance here   14.488647224354589
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man   14.022748973141285
my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself   10.747923582585951
albert rejoined his mother   11.636504026256713
still further athos obtained of m   11.235596070607388
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved   10.153597127442826
the curates asked him what was to be done   7.3972996434313565
said franz hesitating   9.615914808582174
the major s eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment   13.661394490535631
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m   16.912342111224067
the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul   14.526791839988274

d épinay   6.265770516489655
adieu valentine adieu   12.596637569342487
sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour   15.386969676951233
bonacieux holding out her hand to him and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall   12.899959470972444
0103m it is a conspiracy then   11.59503869911941
it is the first time he has ever been in paris   7.5819056941201595
instantly monseigneur   8.876326415951256
cried milady   16.88351033488808
why i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man   21.997406801820375
why not   8.254303642988424
never mind   15.84165593444192
it was in his service that my father made his fortune   15.649302395293473
the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one   7.443307210114987
thought d artagnan   4.600925694727597
said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips   14.976780174751239
since i have the good fortune to meet you i beg you to receive them and to hold me always as one of your friends   12.287204026904806
and how was m   5.5303230291421865
dividing the proceeds the apartment on the first floor of the house in the rue saint germain des prés where albert de morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious person   16.715320867542058
nevertheless he understood it all but was deaf   11.322349187441729
i am not aware of it said albert smiling sorrowfully   5.887572099311818
then you must come up into my room   12.986459681352793
coquenard   12.052807313288744
and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor   12.682738630431814
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet   5.130568402162769
morrel seized the count s hand and kissed it   8.452907315933896
then taking the glass with a firm hand she said drink   8.464209470772367
you m   17.178382877465108
cried monte cristo it was m   12.49788759062323
have you not let it go out of your hands   9.200654505186776
nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it   11.99520521494988
well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the legion of honor was announced in the papers we were all sitting with my grandfather m   8.631131076034519
eight thousand crowns amounted to 48 000 livres   15.51197159407082
how many have we killed of them a dozen   7.121595797788442
we have arrested monsieur de beaufort but he is the least dangerous among them   13.852401365446102
the fifth sharer in edmond s bequest was his own father   11.726800853221134
he was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and i heard the phrase very often as rich as a spada   17.210126699665413
bonacieux who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the louvre was abducted   10.518332482094106
they were waiting at the entrance of the rue sainte catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade   13.957694007328433
pen ink and paper then called fernand loudly   2.5299997690289846
and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich   13.512874725556706
right   13.960139002226681
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality   13.696369471094005
i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaetano but you questioned me and i have answered   10.28539063357381
chapter xxviii   10.52321242816552
that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise   12.745517435538837
he has punished you   8.602090965210289
d artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity   12.296962244471985
debray who both mount the minister s arabians   14.459862280293851
if you wish to see me the king s attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician   12.575935439443278
but the name of m   10.609354719191966
well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits   12.600563325351732
a letter from charles the first   12.859539683526018
well your majesty said he you see how far my enemies go   8.23526970473957
i who was looking on an eager and curious spectator i who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy i who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course i was watching and bitten to the heart   12.29747539183688
and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations   20.001955347382037
is there any crime in this request   3.6183023205006126
that i am exceedingly disquieted sire   11.25181339313419
no   15.005372522087885
i have but one promise and but one heart to give   12.712238741964255
the storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen   15.096339705804262
i will set before him the example of madame de morcerf and her son   12.17817965810801
i believe so said the major   15.216362421612809
both   16.243152506533573
providence is now opposed to them when i most thought it would be propitious   17.10719724264708
i will be an abbé if it suits me   17.232751649074704
the rain of blood as the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glance but there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened   13.374879212747137
yes your excellency   9.75201550789099
good lord how quickly men forget   21.53232904077685
in what month   8.902271118346054
asked d artagnan   10.743482850408276
it is the count s reply   10.611177040940678
they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs   6.779138546678652
two varieties of demons ah cried milady and rochefort together it is you   7.953305661215497
he then walked slowly towards the allées de meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story   14.599243362105629
the young girl looked at morrel   15.501045797963004
well let s say no more about it   10.706444465597867
the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted   15.257812902845643
i must have left it in my room she said   10.616261900672576
said m   13.457473298455227
at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act   6.199258650881882
it is true that the indulgence of his foster mother encouraged him   12.584163223431288
you know maximilian grandpapa once thought of leaving this house and taking an apartment away from m   17.474635890042617
replied mazarin   17.987644780361855
then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m   14.364375279651748
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful   14.488786491256157
yes i should expect so   6.246891352971639
he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked it   6.613333425726854
he ejaculated   9.428804524078606
you say very true responded debray   12.160543816995759
for i criticise him without knowing what he does   8.874096856701009
we are so good and gentle to your eminence   1.057448747918082
but he is advancing by gap and sisteron   14.415699805232531
1   12.33217142063051
i will inquire said morrel   14.2995756118424
yes   12.456578145114285
the prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court   8.056542517911476
yes   12.045492742522313
and the two separated saying till this evening   15.027372301354129
ah since the dangers i incur on my own account can not stop you think of those you may yourself run   12.297735939236054
inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it   13.594269797846795
here you are home again raoul said the comte   14.518152646895803
monte cristo advanced into the room   16.61498683234177
will you be so good   15.654529602502588
de tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon   17.414563533095286
and why not   12.825017919423871
asked franz   8.35935546167735
you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valentine   10.531224153208548
true this story has diverted our attention from them   17.29795170233614
i would rather find it triply bolted   6.1714917542876435
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft   9.119116392883493
e   9.240378903643228
how so   9.881009309937236
are the english expected by land or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers   20.807725026614598
the corsican ogre chapter 12   16.54436342344592
now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither   15.34323600250514
but come what is this about   10.515396448710735
talk only by gestures or rather always listen   10.55925472336986
the fact was that emery s son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed   15.43581529906266
the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great bitterness   8.296669253550613
yes it is indeed he   7.825288194836981
interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders   13.130245859024079
but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man   8.503355672135548
is that true and do you speak seriously   8.275253459188821
the count who perceived that m   17.749453044336356
one of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its hinges   11.150472760044474
as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentine s room to m   6.462801000338962
but no matter   18.227056707226833
he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east   9.761717165124603
this time felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him   11.133167955985412
and with a firm step morrel went up to his study while maximilian followed him trembling as he went   5.3732233248909385
exclaimed mazarin piteously   1.8192035961440638
but as to free will aramis   14.298102036490127
b   9.762305218673125
depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you   14.119738630911659
i saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness   12.295561186070024
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugénie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty   18.172696528810686
asked aramis   11.308612504322507
here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel   12.625048953107482
i will shape it out for you with my knife   14.23664927169435
so my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me   11.473247773238143
the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father   11.98869293951324
ah ah   9.651459240501246
oh no sir said madame danglars   10.009625440279725
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance   15.445791484391213
i am sure of it   7.44838544831698
oh the devil   19.352451355335592
so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room   15.403282522542783
now m   0.32125211603864834
and with whom   10.15428205866736
our conditions said no revenge you will please to recollect   15.235898455960484
no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill   13.751294824309646
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success   10.739625347224326
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand   11.450581364773445

who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed   20.1391143717787

i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone   13.721144369964653
well and by my faith said athos it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being loved   17.40185432441995

what is to be done   9.513274563964085
the prisoner himself is named edmond dantès mate on board the three master the pharaon trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna and belonging to morrel son of marseilles   14.96789317823914
from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his   12.161691253066785
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel   12.051707226901131
the time had come when the implacable spectre which exists in the mind of every human creature arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart thou shalt die   7.341044111961557
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit   11.273986046785268
said madame danglars   14.992525306732864
for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings him   10.87487995682162
repeated anne   13.33828884073284
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinal s cap   24.097064489927472
did you observe d artagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton   19.14122267374701
chapter lxxxi   15.939082625045687
but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips   4.976012229247725
i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me   9.098192330491528
monsieur d artagnan   3.93639504579661
do you invent then said fernand impatiently   14.225833468815178
this chancellor was a pleasant man   13.248124899069046
then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment   13.74490254791061
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it   9.726742117895055
ah pardieu   14.04168604471622
when you like   9.519951030563778
on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow   4.012455710747705
monsieur mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please   13.063506904246154
and when i was removed to the château d if i managed to bring the ravellings with me so that i have been able to finish my work here   16.527112569027125
cried danglars we are not returning to rome   9.403442510630061
and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos   10.084182693448241
here are five hundred pistoles he said   11.001275965107302
but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants   11.16560135046217
towards the evening of the third day   14.289802264879082
but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting   10.485378397620106
m   7.700239694545798
i   14.774275023988189
what is it grimaud   9.780482519161211
i know it said athos coolly since here it is   15.360789699225219
well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them   2.8323588190954805
c   17.969576252750525
i learned that she had been assassinated by my relation aided by four friends but i was already aware that i had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by king charles i   9.69221608590157
besides what dantès had told him of his interview with the grand marshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed him   12.712380486302223
i hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim   14.14711650367122
speak said the queen   10.783440719219989
he shall see how a gentleman can die   14.176897270240085
so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hour s time he stopped before a little isolated house   15.688045145083438
you may copy it give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www   7.4013060389438605
we say slowly for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts   10.041396424585368
the order is positive   13.438440887638947
are you aware my lord that mendacity is an organized body a kind of association of those who have nothing against those who have everything   10.913670456445255
that s all very well replied d artagnan   12.365081736000015
you will be served thus madame three times a day said he   12.503647931394552
although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to speak   14.650993498559673

bonacieux at home it was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king   10.63840967975263
they expected to hear some mention made of d artagnan or of porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and reforms   15.862081609706639
creating the works from print editions not protected by u   19.509902019795
that is to say those who were called   11.496015440135114

haven t you something to say to monsieur de flamarens on your own account   11.591816801494137
i forgot there were three more steps before the landing   8.794575445419337
dantès drew a plan of the island for faria and faria gave dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure   14.302122807251152
but by our holy father the pope cut it short for i shall prune you in my turn i warn you   10.257113398272491
chapter lix   12.407184888218076
one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced beauchamp   7.7273721168757215
or sully louis xiii   14.737460564332586
replied raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life   10.165757855061262
devil take them   9.471201155453977
exclaimed la carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step   16.662704712302617
and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there   13.011070241809266
at all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother in law with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy   10.629392226663295
at last   14.140574808033506
cried d artagnan it s quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here   15.819905607795487
no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud   8.27740897332928
louis at st   11.641442179728225
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and d artagnan and advanced toward the door   15.450674425066047
without doubt   17.353599802746977
and then said madame de villefort endeavoring by a struggle and with effort to get away from her thoughts however skilfully it is prepared crime is always crime and if it avoid human scrutiny it does not escape the eye of god   9.820664483745055
it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino   10.719243561788005
aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution   7.600698297588707
de guitaut mme   21.349433679993737
how do you mean   18.501269764206413
cried the steward here   10.541357087248823
at the age of five years   19.252707343667133
ah   5.944433023526538
the night was extremely dark   13.869315742389741
monsieur de tréville is ill so my company can t do without me   11.990215695254621
for the demon of speculation drew a line or in other words projected a street at the farther side of the kitchen garden   16.011567992133394
an adventure on the high road   8.71928539069118
then raising his sword sound trumpets   16.81918374088084
what for philip   11.220795085841162
continued d artagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other   12.947364295354083
1   10.288080357139286
d artagnan related his story simply with the omission of names   10.420563942226767
the last month s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude   16.71091328183147
my friends monsieur   16.045357712730848
cried porthos they have not even pursued us   9.767625772105355
happily d artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties   17.64671806881811
but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again immediately   6.745314591935333
then d artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house   7.137590087526262
which said the abbé to himself you would have done   11.514361938811428
to say that i shall live here like the mercédès of other times gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe me   14.734746907270665
they made all speed to come up to this gentleman who appeared to be in great haste   12.171915881792783
but tell me valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart   12.561815913327052
the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the swiss   13.524696587725838
come gentlemen let us all propose some place   19.300969413659438
winter give the necessary orders   6.647777700754766
what is his name   15.354145954068855
dantès was on his bed   15.557557969168512
asked the notary   19.814831482922383
answered caderousse you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner   18.74085581443841

grimaud my good grimaud   8.244778969327665
the heights of pindus towered above us   15.306969504216589
he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the âme damnée of the cardinal disguised as a capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked monsieur de laigues like a ninny as he is   17.579575983380714
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages   17.298370750132282
said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial love   11.450548770313969
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed   17.48737988169517
the southern districts were ill watched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nîmes or uzès   14.211820880287277
who are you   16.38121012649857
said he i have travelled through sicily and calabria i have sailed two months in the archipelago and yet i never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate   14.554443794323275
cried blaisois i wish i had been in his place   11.464716140204214
porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room   10.036859186784765
valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy   19.85477579825816

he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still insensible   7.958271290316283
i returned to the seminary   15.431521091617393
the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms crossed   11.254517820103345
alas   10.249323581459144
this threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended   8.188573936434189
once outside the city d artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood   10.043134585545904
we can not say   11.242432233656894
i follow you   4.551714006365459
but of course it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you   5.2155352491434765
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion   15.978755641135091
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de château renaud   10.818061575387619
ah   11.126575871118451
dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door   12.308951076771542
come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly   8.888277030183541
said athos   7.8991434791619515
yes the porter   5.749386650356865
the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700 000 francs in the course of an hour   8.642767952714149
and to you a good journey   13.90646837104887
but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth   13.118870504255556
do they know him   12.676914677739546
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other   15.622490357534716
to what do you allude monsieur   22.796320831862943
d artagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for   15.358540820339131
well pardieu   9.357981298208017
did you know that   8.069242349411265
go therefore and await it at boulogne sur mer and promise me to set out to morrow morning   12.446576330118093
death is always death that is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from grief   15.568320849375649
speak   14.147303130620118
danglars turned very red   7.117821150234586
dantès must be crushed to gratify villefort s ambition   15.401175288117821
replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats   16.49729371365837
you have promised to be secret my good monsieur   10.194745867845961
suddenly we heard loud cries   13.554673712881069
everyone offered his own   2.9213739262188962
but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard   6.585090568422039
ha   15.909357925525201
monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him   10.406328321145644
they will come in due season   21.298989076478776
besides i must think of my outfit   10.42923193789243
9   20.879854216539773
that s well   9.91893772290991
this man goes to give his last orders   12.831515362846774
tell him i beg you that i am his humble servant   12.21801022973999
said la ramee   12.653883689409144
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart   15.176440405028607
she thought that lord de winter had hastened her departure   10.638665723558471
perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them   8.486241953261167
at your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one   13.84820216277458
we are in france and i am spanish   14.024434046228304
i am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so i keep him   4.022506043421151
workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house   16.285079231358484
yes you are right maximilian i will follow you   9.600909020989265
i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment   11.73303051815982
this house is part of valentine s marriage portion and m   8.951391411711464
i have a son   1.969465866348557
asked château renaud   13.291697988195033
and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man   13.364353549533513
benedetto   15.163633582400177
do you know him   6.675780010120423
it appeared to d artagnan that he had embraced a statue   14.626302076371
but as we never thought of coming here i am informed that there are in all only three beds in the whole establishment one for the king one for me and one for the cardinal muttered the prince   16.67264663341965
you are a noble minded woman and it was your grief that disarmed me   10.196626621089617
said the young man laughing i confess it and so much more the readily my dear bonacieux as i see there is no concealing anything from you   13.03254214038239
i have now to confess to you   14.279734070464137
no one will come said she   18.325308831332933
my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it   8.32716627687529
he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary   15.834403819922894
said debray   17.953056424687425
when the procession reached the palace loud cries of long live their majesties   5.642178136855759
well sir   10.78667376530072
nothing will ever go well with us hereafter   10.764877702904007
chapter xxvi   12.823691884530053
well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boy slayer   16.36831611597816
at them   23.237370072415246
the lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother   10.108997204205133
i trust all this will soon be taken away   8.212744858780505
aramis shuddered in spite of himself   11.949024657816304
and i also said porthos   7.305725777853634
my maid then entered with a light   10.082416346710298
and his immense riches whence does he procure them   12.45231629688796

i know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much   3.536415723995587
asked monte cristo   9.664303001066692
what undertaking can have brought him to paris   11.022907929854778
sir replied monte cristo coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs   17.627260948407056
you ll excuse me i know   13.227010431176543
bonacieux   8.400927234803579
said monte cristo smiling   12.17487839184242
on your return you can not make a mistake   10.026428972523595
my hôtel will be always open to you   14.51689448300419
ah   13.742967292587208
his eminence sent me   11.7814641917865
m   17.843036490481072
but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have none   7.795278345738205
how is it arranged   7.514189907483447
let him come and he will find a change i will answer for it   14.280940214233867
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied   11.724704464165377
a rondeau   19.3598642217171
that s right   10.914270590930727
when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you   11.92191039465062
there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin   18.138961904325853
grimaud begins his functions   13.258867550483986
well i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him   14.968543345842045
at the louvre   10.832568265253938
look my lord cardinal said aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love   16.303607128994617
messieurs athos porthos and aramis   18.208483082796803
d artagnan called the sergeant   16.94008263170567
they thought that nauseous   14.44028980301329
as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you   15.3486653601265
not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile   16.714692475798202
let us pass on to private and personal stipulations   7.62728532293212
interposed laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle   13.294500813352778
chapter lvii   13.314775996877131
de tréville   12.361322254092547
a propos you have probably one or two friends   10.013444802668161
we are never quits with those who oblige us was dantès reply   14.81018843259121
i think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in france   14.736097532545555
exclaimed aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him   19.5478269632951
d artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear the fact is we that is monsieur du vallon and i hesitated a little   14.45253941329329
some grew rich and some were ruined   4.582280366076336
these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness   11.69836614000118
he calls himself so   8.206858874689795
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person   13.9111852133265
but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior   13.283307330049272
a keeper replied grimaud   15.927233750446053
however i will not go back on my word and i will give 45 000   19.162745921003662
lord wilmore   19.885381553390797
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawing rooms   11.037740383533194
m   10.151201554411482
said he i hope all is over explained and settled   12.752093930156496
at the end of the second day m   11.81343445193596
the monk   9.991031160885004
four marble steps led down to the water s edge and below them was a boat floating on the tide   6.670640431441897
and the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and mademoiselle d armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through   10.21645386886532
let us be open with each other   11.85369093939271
i was now safe for i could swim along the ditch without being seen and i reached the canal in safety   11.192589958484517
it appears however said lord de winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me   9.187457890689704
very rich do you think   16.684212423881355
when do you leave   6.041754740192024
50095m i rave   20.142620284491677
a propos inform bazin   16.75487926959037
28   5.114715654755633
you are in a hurry sir count said d artagnan   8.752517930922457
where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese   8.34538923513879
do what you please monsieur chevalier   10.429300937439614
asked athos   19.511948667278016
bonacieux had opened his door and seeing the apartment had returned to the man in the cloak whom he had left alone for an instant   10.631432192881622
these words redoubled the eagerness of d artagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace   14.650356110060194
see   12.586605597918814
they had understood each other without speaking   17.833709440576747
asked milady   11.620035603289962
to me she seems overloaded observed eugénie   9.618431529851446
i accept   8.91401950718138
these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his pocket   19.310076536375323
bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description   12.008399885888286
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him   10.903837316468744
ah   9.65308698235674
and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse s tail and thus they took me to nîmes   7.0492232021744545
daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak   6.783448703611641
asked gondy   8.042392378914387
hum   16.87751104919554
and the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of contempt   9.462458535871125
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit   18.98770039494079
has he any friends   13.707613377221547
you are a hundred times too good   6.050629027308183
why   12.304319879455472
asked the duke uneasily   12.412459681030331
and she has ten or twelve days as lord de winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told her   11.726413633549017
meanwhile albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying florentin is your horse fit to return immediately   11.366896568211539
the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard   11.771042632056567
not badly answered i faith said gondy laughing   13.048321235482886
mazarin   9.587929011824109
you are much pleased with yourself said he to raoul when they were alone are you not   13.664997536761371
the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night   22.15173864665323
pray tell me how it happened   15.701594974559388
here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum   12.165426282197664
who could have said so the evening before   18.194667924617146
oh madame do not think that   8.22464734877846
the crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee   15.561422792858757
he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings   15.919215018182964
look closely   8.838669290520752
let us see said aramis how are we to act   11.959067888733122
but you continued m   12.53728558828731
oh yes yes   16.83627934433516
athos is not a man to be thwarted   17.140781759240596
the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be difficult   8.14104384335404
this idea while darkening his brow drew several sighs from him and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance   11.489782817940931
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life   13.910006985941349
she exclaimed rising   15.605850893246632
d artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword   10.629797128770736
could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida and the chinese eat swallows nests   12.363113969776188
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired   11.695512048605233
the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france and also to escape the frondeurs who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes   23.650352581682384
morrel   2.8036160563020758
the division being made by the light of bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis   12.885853049018555
said milady   8.987218386670298
here it is said he   15.935557669443247
he was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face   13.58477459941029
it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death   7.180573488176004
agreeable   13.973676483311738
the latter smiled   11.105326352267264
i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow   12.751814569833035
he asked   11.066196382806158
but you will be resigned my friend   9.856391136463385
now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch   12.307505864203735
well that will do charmingly said the count   9.322624987068147
this evening said the governor when the task was ended   17.48187047315458
the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded   22.13499856214981
but that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the boulevard de la madeleine and an income of 50 000 livres   14.242277729948732
ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen   10.77839412788921
and i even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for you   4.563836615902316
i have not yet had time to see him again   14.68534798679337
to whom   10.26616041011478
d artagnan he said you are here to night still infuriated by yesterday s adventure   12.866999013706893
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abbé d herblay of whom you have often heard me speak   9.011204014765685
they found the carriage where they had left it   4.17144681907239
it is possible   13.669316274546922
yes if my friends agree   10.992151616568723
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment   14.832860789862089
your hands   8.832760992586351
perhaps some accident has happened to him   17.144777214358058
so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced   20.422549124251464
that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today   10.585788543289018
your uncle   18.506919335927982
and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the door   17.18917521577353
at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase   9.84953563061423
1   24.790026022457504
d artagnan shrugged his shoulders   23.640231081423856
d avrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door   12.496737274470489
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough   17.471250533068453
he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons   15.06988811699014
you are certainly going mad   8.798850975622168
but instead of adding if your succor does not arrive within fifteen days we will surrender it added quite simply if your succor comes not within fifteen days we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes   21.32839631705796
let each take seventy five   17.132294767586508
pardieu   12.106044725057842
well now you understand mother   15.13573137721858
and according to his custom d artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him   7.125267149850739
what the deuce can you expect   8.451768603229809
we set forth on our journey   16.940068081218655

and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier   8.815227257360412
that the baron de chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward mme   13.662456203638682
this is the last judge   17.216091036952445

i wish we were already there said d artagnan   3.8058065395370537
no no albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orange flowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes   5.652639016625847
and the scotch   13.263008052975131
oh   15.807086442459463
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it   11.795415879212053
now we are on the right scent   14.397119244735421
sire said d artagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question   24.592205260760693

the law would seize it and put you in prison   8.943942881141272
aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell   7.282410258227444
here i am in their name said m   11.077347086714557
he has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it   15.85709939754775
however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone   10.04289302248902
then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored   8.498304643427003
his only fear was that milady would recognize in him the man of meung and of dover   15.17598446356544
it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements   13.77782748621204
don t be a coward or i shall cut off your ears   12.273715465414108
the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected   14.536383780691931
and why should he not have this   10.795428307381476
edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow who had been one of his own sailors as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance   10.299927712597354
the valet entered   14.066463421668725
well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world   4.630704607062728
come sweep away all that for me   16.514164339047348
the bustle which had been observed by henrietta maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason was occasioned by the battle of lens announced by the prince s messenger the duc de chatillon who had taken such a noble part in the engagement   15.280674341479417
i am lost   9.113304042375663
they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word   8.00290696894528
but after reading them over many times i found out that with one hundred and fifty well chosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know   10.172819250030994
what folly murmured anne of austria who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances   16.835738787462308
i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome   16.930147890218855
but la ramee who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art passed his knife which had an iron blade to the duke   9.519018555196325
it was the governor who hearing of faria s illness from the jailer had come in person to see him   17.678716150426794
you can t imagine how much this conversation interests me   11.564149426209347
yes   7.8090629641821145
yes monseigneur replied the young man   11.933155239538369
the abbé busoni said la carconte   13.58697996695887
in my opinion the people are right   14.856110190154986
monsieur duke i must have those letters   19.032560381694132
the name of the owner of the winning horse   12.231203227706068
eh eh   10.529564782435484
instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts   13.725501765490371
but the accomplice shall become the avenger   12.692253987167277
the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale   8.215410492773948
dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice   13.431718534108319
obey that person implicitly   13.092336812385515
milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes   20.641959184826696
be satisfied monsieur said planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in me   19.641470013449947
if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it   6.473909709933809
you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m   18.374273856930035
no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not come   13.8448161977293
and d artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one   10.071881783315064
what has happened   16.255458397019158
i call those second rate fortunes that are gained by manufacturing enterprises joint stock companies viceroyalties and principalities not drawing more than 1 500 000 francs the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions   7.52460716116182
the queen had just regained her chamber and d artagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly touched   12.247873212659458
well what is it   9.885413407542739
athos and aramis exchanged smiles   15.98432933950325
yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock   12.223757366878713
the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal   6.284381372119887
however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible   5.883702367929526
that is one more than m   16.33715559174702
d artagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise   15.158548213435106
from a certain abbé busoni   18.000228069648106
concerning a court intrigue chapter ix   14.643665639739185
i hope so at least   14.768647649026425
they can gain battles   10.135049661850797
and however i may be honored by your friendship my worthy friend if once the extent of our intimacy were known i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby   8.490755710129424
take every care of him i beg of you   11.04100185394067
bazin remained at the window   12.757605435898165
from that time d artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of mme   18.293776730239124
the less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man   12.374912290091164
ah   13.325218611131572
planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible   1.0828007715966308
on the 1st morrel returned   7.4946677119297185
now this was a sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him   3.533554843663362
look at it and tell me what you think of it   17.18878347437994
even to swear by mahomet   15.644364363571176
you are young   10.822775413429751
if it brings us back to france well   4.7834171417442874
renée uttered a smothered exclamation   8.803788732562806
you mean a mischance   12.82435568183709
i received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact i rendered him   11.842542746559253
in two or three hours thought dantès the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm   14.098342851756062
i deserted the church for the world for you know that i forced myself when i became a musketeer   18.626269069040077
you must return to the rue des fossoyeurs   10.7408745470014
at rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal who has either kept them near him or sent them to saint germain   13.969239975088154
the same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king   18.58668652288148
cried monte cristo   13.987074202300729
i can not endure the modern school of painting   11.475887267233595
the third act had begun   9.308351258301936
my dear blacas said the king you with your alarms prevent me from working   20.98922934200126
well i m sure said morcerf this is indeed news   4.598950639189984
previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle   16.603678025619505
but listen to me listen and you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief i am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon you   9.489296878365472
really my dear monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me   12.304745825916147
accomplish the orders of lord de winter said felton with a gloomy smile   21.829941892546557
gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to rest   24.60478476456822
said andrea my servant s coat and my hat   12.435387795291831
le baron franz d épinay   11.218445516491856
well then you wish to know if i am of mazarin s party   13.641289783607261
have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten   9.03284927181853
sir he said i can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty   11.625434973111078
what does it signify to you if i am murdered   13.107563519062351
dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay   10.012094457826954
he guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurator s wife of the rue aux ours which was the more probable from the church of st   13.092738829008072
ah   12.674610162320903
no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father s actions   3.3257109864437773
and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man   14.366959748746956
tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger   4.668243060890035
bless me   4.6075523106428
you do not doubt it   14.658581607631454
the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden   16.19385181767508
go and see   12.063083837397011
do you wish to see me again   10.667114704882104
they soon arrived at the silent solitary inn   7.348861692841291
for heaven s sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heaven s sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch   13.49183188400888
asked milady with surprise   14.882105442554899
gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor   7.16405466605153
to paris   5.823885055781022
yes in so many words   19.971625287720727
no monsieur it is impossible   13.160973165046547
demanded the notary thinking he had only to insert this clause but waiting first for the assent of noirtier which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene   8.359378191806854
formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request   19.594985627488278
then ringing the bell once look   14.82824511295432
i have found already   14.234891565012626
i agree to it too said porthos if d artagnan approves of it   11.98161831450092
d artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword   13.171455394917324
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened   8.24047804056469
pardon reverend sir said caderousse   8.555527425634473
in which m   11.90290120029044
for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet i made it fifty   12.074990902871951
said dantès wiping his brow with his sleeve   6.850476289224127
what do you not know your house   21.337242233200612
they must be good animals then   10.911063214070458
as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit   8.750961353019315
duke said the queen blushing never speak of that evening   5.37634880044789
her hand   12.362757560239421
it was to visit her king henry iv   9.899199244806573
handle the musket and the sword my dear fellow   12.096506192849418
the swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded d artagnan as an intruder   17.117564542554646
no one answered   19.501464453685077
and pray asked the baroness am i responsible for this loss   23.264547390732524
planchet emboldened by the first exploit sprang upon lubin   10.374809967934532
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them   6.1502801898719035
50253m peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the fowl   19.64807222374442
but the gates were too strong   13.042187815191703
what   6.187040365369791
but know you who he was   16.207641401026304
come in said louis xviii   17.8416513664299
she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity   8.308640903088001
he was no   7.432965145259696
he will inform against you   9.652060789284743
most likely replied vampa coolly   9.15340188679672
chapter 41   15.605730780235328
d artagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to return   15.621627898305793
then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death as i now am sweet beloved valentine   9.36435966012867
silence said the abbé   11.337568879878503
and for myself i assure you i could not sleep either for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast   12.333930876119306
monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out   13.776517055550691
why   12.917277377072642
was it you who asked him to drink some of it   14.86498587102281
we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and double barrelled guns   16.413687434888963
you have guessed rightly   15.136386331036563
said albert with increased though stifled anger   7.413441238170402
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself   6.516803321371484
the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived   13.826727151703261
by circumstances   6.372841479604705
if they continue to advance we must fire again   14.962506465202907
the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint   24.464295228175565
i neither approve nor disapprove my lord   13.089190499717159
if we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource   12.99521590628451
does this oath satisfy you   8.61485548045876
but a confession made to the judges a confession made at the last moment extorted when the crime can not be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty   12.993768599735857
said porthos   10.95664207241782
you   11.50016366397053
then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all   7.470134386042906
profession artist   9.80031759654715
the chevalier   10.5219023204746
obey said noirtier s intelligent eye   11.96049047242507
perfectly well   7.969488723028338
good news   10.622878662084004
let him be removed from the house that he may not see master edward is not downstairs sir replied the valet   13.653367833120607
mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in paris replied caderousse   16.48423983719676
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door madame he said i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay   17.126018751609777
he is dead sir   15.097013518088067
mark   15.064849353493978
two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire furniture   9.487631188450269
he resolved to end his anxiety   12.300977693064727
then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief   18.122930489951727
and we were impatiently waited for at paris were we not   11.106533744474497
perhaps so replied d artagnan   11.187700714490049
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question   12.41880280195292
but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments   8.696507523249334
said louise with regret   13.485684079943649
monsieur you run no risk for as i told you i will stay here   13.912720574924261
but you is there nothing that you want   9.564110614648873
i will confess all to her i will tell her daily that i also have committed a crime   23.671519642118433
that makes ten days   11.038007538540349
he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof   10.322135709251715
and that was why i threw myself between you and him   6.334712170301906
why this evening said the abbess   15.915263467381592
you are not a woman said athos coldly and sternly   13.077992169937795
to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening   16.1250199952652
if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase project gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1   5.564275873521572
yes indeed that s the right thing   13.616856137832894

that is not for me to say   19.18854405887699
that is true said the king   6.593253345432416
to the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal valentine s condition   10.802011264129053
silence d artagnan   12.372638405133213
but d artagnan was still in a desponding mood   16.278347518074874
an instant after the broken door was removed and the pale face of athos appeared who with a rapid glance took a survey of the surroundings   2.7980763588280695
de saint méran s oldest friends and chamberlain to the comte d artois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence   9.849074625999101
in this room at about ten o clock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound   15.915826645432956
i know the full importance of the statement i have just made and the disposition of the man to whom i have made it   12.63331771064704

whence came the blow   10.245217279958332
one evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to marseilles from the catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever   21.922058263609898

we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel son of marseilles   10.135848594625774
none of her women accompanied her   9.392269916727788
your captivity shall be mild be assured   12.399125757828607
yes madame said monte cristo   15.708382479977361

they can t be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse   18.400772095308188
i will complain to monsieur de tréville and monsieur de tréville will complain to the king   6.476427229647456
richelieu knew that in combating england he combated buckingham   15.773348214705996
eh   11.824662069407859
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person   5.816508275954832
she will escape us replied the young man   15.998664066292884
and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer   18.927564920926518
d avrigny continued to look at noirtier   10.16673290034466
yes yes let us fly   7.513076496421052
morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol   14.192836912631094
oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together   15.424431548533844
come come said andrea sheathe your sword my fine fellow   14.82454791297971
de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms   14.290632942997455
at any rate i think so   8.309729061550076
but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts   14.626904406140486
but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me   7.832530698648579
one must take the world as one finds it   16.063216255755027
faria still continuing to instruct dantès by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another   13.570414345399076
and now the ranks began to open   8.157163162443773
i know that it is terrible said d artagnan   13.527212500547472
on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his oath   17.595596748138405
alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe   8.159038919233627
0123m but how can i sell out here   10.301015096954002
morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted   9.997803186718091
then said tréville it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace   8.781354622136465
the cardinal s guards   13.485470843359007
advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour   5.872762344275844
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement   9.573425497497848
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief   9.122266821265404
from the same drawer she took a man s complete costume from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was nothing superfluous but every requisite   13.37500352659103
and the illustrious what s the name of the lad whom i made a sergeant in piedmont s regiment   11.913800308425861
what do you mean   11.23058367816023
i narrowly escaped catching a fever there   13.947072840413584
but alexander vi   13.640990450832854
franz d épinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife   13.810928744607393
bertuccio said he i intend going this evening to normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day   15.318423069290226
these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long   6.795004674369664
at one corner where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it though situated but a hundred paces off   9.067438622824424
chapter xlv   5.8344727151397136
go and tell laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the marechal de villeroy and summon him to me   14.238365827555123
be kind enough to pardon me madame   12.034067003260859
is he some minister out of office   5.039086473603171
said porthos   10.84631320796131
he began   11.824013467305083
they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning   4.94108514877637
go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this   15.070122220498035
whether queens or not they are always the same   22.115203435731893
well then wretches cried danglars i will defy your infamous calculations i would rather die at once   11.543973384884483
milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled   9.006683030204364
with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of madame de saint méran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at m   14.635472352489
5 where lord wilmore lived   15.222361362893484
the monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed   14.097814789233485
four years ago penelon was at trieste penelon count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become gardener penelon when he was at trieste saw on the quay an englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of june 1829 and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of september   14.484408151839661
i can do much for you my friend replied the count   7.527357231987791
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man   14.97640539286039
i have not that honor   7.151926484860224
let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said franz   6.565018348023835
but you stopped at the idea i hope   11.663252688601748
while speaking caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions   19.259747037115282
but monsieur you know then i know that you have been abducted madame   11.289158731176927
but said franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law   16.098918643331135
he also was dying of hunger   12.462437482869591
such as the son of a noble house would have   7.979851754297337
aramis smiled   8.215560800420764
and albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at her   14.18821219914303
albert placed it in his button hole and the carriage went triumphantly on   12.28191284017465
ah said mme   17.39083152077548
the count received him with his habitual smile   15.608891306000935
well then i should say for instance resumed danglars that if after a voyage such as dantès has just made in which he touched at the island of elba someone were to denounce him to the king s procureur as a bonapartist agent i will denounce him   12.131911991418104
aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud   18.201874329512798
asked d artagnan   17.604694506992775
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you   10.379734187907712
i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state   12.270924413274416
all is over   11.180228844524155
no monsieur no   6.780892558256842
how came it known   10.253035903257995
you were no stranger to me for i knew you from the time i gave up two rooms to you invited you to breakfast with me lent you one of my carriages witnessed the carnival in your company and saw with you from a window in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted   7.387851148413125
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber   12.0557562020443
she was young you say   16.294386722932835
my friend   24.093502678506137
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion   12.546317584189564
and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection m   14.125441879693549
morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness   15.327122630944938
michael which came from my husband   20.286991853019696
france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch   9.970414916873256
oh don t be afraid sir replied aramis   18.993469431926584
not if thou dost not oppose my flight   14.115324339277306
raoul   13.501356001803506
porthos and i will stay here   4.157865101265447
asked d artagnan hesitatingly   11.350336060933651
one went to support d artagnan the other porthos   14.600351540145592
for i presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her   10.710147672568212
the count and franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a door   9.925002130113434
asked athos in a low tone   13.672007351200365
i have but one portmanteau   14.656143999495018
repeated the inspector   0.5502490860162101
oh heavens said the young man oh heavens what are you saying count   13.114466628314608
he was now a lieutenant   15.422625661285629
they had been ushered into madame de villefort s room who had said she would receive them there   8.417916151083757
to day the third will be there also   15.07836488212569
thanks to the attentions of raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him   7.253677982837462
it is he   8.619096610960614
she became excessively pale leaned her beautiful hand upon a console which hand appeared then like one of wax and looking at the king with terror in her eyes she was unable to reply by a single syllable   10.505452450850063
truly truly said madame danglars all my linen is marked thus   17.352244582282385
the devil   9.562176332022593
that is true enough returned caderousse   15.216781050637454
in private   7.645549739516609
grimaud s first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour s riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe   10.88096950560378
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself   17.314558019202533
we have seen them at villefort s   6.029066415319116
i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo   16.652703588626668
the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair   11.639681263405771
you have them   8.551867253878772
in addition to the sword there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of henry iii   7.715942413635188
that is correct said the executioner   8.784264222466474
your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead   15.772703100900664
inquired the baroness   17.29414321128431
to you no to you alone   10.342826927906167
on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before   11.478020050964847
thus all my opinions i will not say public but private are confined to these three sentiments i love my father i respect m   18.558465751996376
and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor   13.495366866112215
you   15.695577800230964
m   16.929380583115854
what the devil can you do with all that   11.988387216056825
besides you know i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france   14.041336427910366
alas   19.38380090297902
you wish to terrify me i suppose   12.738368601704751
he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court   12.94681966922352
in malta i forget what   12.824862360590828
you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough   11.798472281315924
thought d artagnan the man i am warned against by athos   12.534986499272456
and you would act rightly   6.223989202457771
you think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors   16.517051394918028
noirtier   21.03317225006599
poison death   16.45070899619014
caderousse sighed   15.47121537224325
a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms   21.45079994657378
by a lackey named lubin   12.040655871201366
well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini   14.586340935646918
have you kitchens here   16.754672056291692
then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in lyons   10.365804747185917
at this order given in athos s habitually calm manner the face of the gascon relaxed and porthos s brow grew smooth   4.770106378909934
that is to say i visit an englishwoman the one i named   12.509269293672597
in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of god   14.554774184347131
porthos made a most significant grimace   11.767578265668988
on seeing d artagnan rise porthos rose also   7.967123420311192
thanks sire thanks said the duke   9.332069601785015
what did he say in the letter   12.792354812970315
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way   19.663583995618012
the appointed hour was about to strike   10.371261791496178
captain gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma   18.06108166610477
but this proved useless for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six months   15.756321520263807
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression   10.735876698911252
take the least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be gone   12.099372133623998
yes   12.843103803563576
de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume   14.875598623799457
besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible   14.089366170940812
god will give it me   4.855520100353139
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile   7.412202307742246
whom does your highness wish me to send to you   18.776273783997784

ah said monte cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance   12.538966095108364
i had a plan   15.965426597493144
it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked   21.527871499836458
is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles   10.309059068400721
first a thrust with the coadjutor whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet s and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me   15.791776038156446
that is true   14.730470002293501
furnished with this plunder andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes   8.83369922113065
franz d épinay said he   9.564200741048971
i am not referring in the least to matrimony and i only addressed myself to m   16.148812212605215
yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner i have described   10.84294428480533
you are right said monte cristo   15.382567429536302
you are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me   5.410228303755953
but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities   10.938486431584826
many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated   19.068921004996522
cried he clasping his hands   5.796756247573715
so i have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone   8.12298715439705
in the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet   7.552620015043316
you know about it   12.414677574844562
he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres   19.08677950341984
only 700 000 francs out of my cash box nothing more   9.305415661197156
not only a benefactor but a father   11.779395342371226

arise vicomte embrace me   6.723855893276697
saved   13.040714919674928
caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor   10.481873005996754
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth   9.473842591280883
then you are wrong madame   6.170387019968971
that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument   16.191543517867633
those were the count s windows   6.551718370798783
well we will go by the corso   11.598572046257846
at the fourth the count knew what to expect   17.009947914289874
you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal   15.865000155540859
it appears so   16.751196324888216
he thought of what was in store for his poor horses   11.166924709190708
ah beauchamp i see you know something already   10.706856190558723
take care said madame de villefort the king s attorney is here   13.621822938600223
cries were heard from the camp come down   6.506136407092942
is it pressing business   9.860110146456568
i neither reproach you nor hate you my friend   13.698464567968278
the footman s mission was an easy one   3.434026832359363
monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you   6.810421396131069
oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere   16.727717497323823
thus i was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen   23.19122759282172
yes my lord   13.73237555433727
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queen oh my lord   5.074147475029252
cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with joy saved you are saved   8.532325435957128
why do you offer me 4 000 000 for what is worth 5 000 000   14.601309574710214
how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of porthos   13.002675615943996
but where are you going   16.603887529921867
ah   9.601211021845902
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly   11.092547076175425
shall we return together   14.33466440339797
is he still in a fit   17.868980336108656
at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside   17.176054329521392
then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued grimaud   18.422672059687436
major cavalcanti   15.687669710093232
is he here in paris   14.023384884487015
are we going to continue this pace all night   9.8696364848239
but as before she expected him in vain   10.567042915905672
what a confounded long time this first act lasts   1.5153366450846821
life is not worth speaking of   9.474805386963002
alas alas what a fearful extremity   17.93911550255358
make yourself easy we are quite alone said andrea   12.02415011451705
in honest truth raoul   17.066195219647092
when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father   11.130574392601808
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me   9.649705798551635
but on my part said milady how should i repay such a service   16.34331070503859
see paragraph 1   19.490455703407875
don t let us disarrange your eminence   6.940318716212356
let each one pick out his man   7.6294238784915756
because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road   15.591657778842858
asked debray   12.787190906755216
monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it   5.546630411946873
but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body   7.906025408691415
do you know that i am to be beheaded outside this window   10.406194937628502
at this moment the door was opened quickly and a messenger introduced by one of the gatekeepers of the bastille gave a letter to the commissary   15.970520013062188
the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery   3.1526024908354042
that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it   14.178388594156331
she exclaimed let him come in   5.943246231902055
in getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at court   11.765133417040694
and he who says in projection means already decided said debray   7.485381672186382
it arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saws   19.20964854160525
d artagnan then only half lied which is lying but little when he said that by going in search of milady he at the same time went in search of constance   9.928462658693503
and as to my other instructions   6.636054587188702
and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime i believe i do society a kindness   11.965186918414794
my lord said athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much pain   12.556033982882678
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day   25.95069566171098
i confess myself conquered   15.835946778279288
de villefort   4.106798287175822
and he put his horse into a trot   3.297038290089608
the conditions will be better than afterward   20.28826711496469
you should always strive to see clearly around you   0.08266453907337734
for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother s faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus   12.41874814872051
sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword   13.130116225250804

i told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in such houses as those in houses that had no signs   16.01797077168203
will your excellency deign to open it   15.388820000733846
still he had not even uttered a sigh   11.830295362429668
de tréville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress   10.73740118614216
and how was the anonymous letter written   16.102823990380685
and here is the second   18.666898159053545
but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date 30th july 1816 and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again   14.55206198807619
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano   11.262512447830957
in spite of his prudence d artagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below   12.905941568374741
yes said cromwell   8.131589779194845

de tréville   13.102002082446631
inquired the grave digger who was looking on   10.559602841244276
albert de morcerf is no coward   10.191030377966813
good morning madame said the count bowing   15.58255114336635
cried comminges   10.00500895177018
only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas   14.670165900111614
he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals   9.38401187674317
f   16.585452407845075

bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe   9.969020879054845
let it be then the day after to morrow said aramis   11.432111742179897
i know my place and am not so presumptuous   11.632488022008518
exclaimed emmanuel while two large tears rolled down julie s cheeks never behold you again   8.937722464661622
then he is not dead   18.125511137503068
why do you doubt   7.485065798827737
at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him   17.094534669021968
but where you go i go   11.278872496281968
no bring me all four together   10.64613113182126

but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added athos knitting his brow monsieur d artagnan shall not leave us   14.708472261559642
such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it   4.39747698922451
or camille de bois tracy   17.561959435075305
but either i was deceived or hell has resuscitated you   8.924161290675954
what more do you want   12.946247939714395
in order that there might be no confusion franz wore his peasant s costume   20.93201031393354
ah ah   18.56521417296862

albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother   15.16351695569837

so he only said that she had gone out with her step mother and that she should be fetched   20.035868964982722
he was a stout man of about two or three and twenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach   10.502503975878374

give me drink said he i thirst i burn   9.664253821221422
it however proved otherwise   11.415468087207937
yes sir replied franz   12.419355611083123
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name   14.604253201495224
no one has been able to accomplish that   14.577642809178883
the burning marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light   13.26955754738194

i am glad to see you are of my opinion   14.788441515279871
he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket   13.8479240288212
the count s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl s mind   11.26302521610544
by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her   10.716030982458346

it is because you love me   13.99801584904094
i am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible   11.171125535579181
