oh sir how good you are   64.08968012884276
just so   33.36449141769464
ali brought in the coffee   157.32884742642506
tell me replied faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape   78.09643567020251
indeed   138.93276186039745
oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart ennui can find no place   131.47933192715723
said d artagnan the expression is strong   130.0054304573396
and you understand that they would have saved the king   210.20172334360237
asked d artagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery   93.50664062358989
valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed   104.45114493439661
the family had all retired to rest but villefort who alone remained up and worked till five o clock in the morning reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates compiling the depositions of the witnesses and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered   121.58510921287612
oh   33.78640690162371
she is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it   173.37660911974928
madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon   96.85500818044689
it is excellent advice   192.03001634788788
but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty   76.28498763282431
in the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait   180.35669390415305
at half past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour   100.75901633469782
your affair is not bad said athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good   57.90879360710887
no monsieur   44.05268922600813
the cicerone reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coachman   146.15062681720963
is there anything new in the wind   100.66656958546955
jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it   96.25845339374304
no maximilian i am not offended answered she but do you not see what a poor helpless being i am almost a stranger and an outcast in my father s house where even he is seldom seen   155.84599657013194
after which ebullition he departed not however without walking several times to the door of the press room as if he had half a mind to enter   191.41446469227225
she thought felton had told all   110.29304085038669
for an active ambitious nature like that of milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious days   60.288903423878914
oh my god my god   106.89375249512531
yes and a sincere friend   66.03555442574554
the door at last opened   142.237395781273
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king   136.11222966954162
speech failed her   129.07314046201782
ah indeed   186.0101339009671
he has probably been killed   88.46637883324973
the count understood him   181.61823314633176
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town   5.45763540292991
the man who abducted my wife   135.1095262674717
what dreadful sufferings   76.03833390489015
then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown   187.6648236007526
morrel   73.7712469959709
de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair   167.98451207383516
does your excellency happen to be hungry   67.23426388630898
better then pursue our enterprise   119.80539591129208
and we sailed under mizzen topsails and top gallant sails   61.53851724969453
because it is the air she always breathed in her youth   125.33387144796869
good   124.89204816529062
i bought two thirds of the shares of that company   79.68699509280574
listen to me franz said albert   114.15230577266107
my friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose   62.667675494677006
oh then some pledge of your indulgence some object which came from you and may remind me that i have not been dreaming   25.569531928234
he did not look like an executioner   166.0986535387851
probably   99.90660620180535
while reading this letter d artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers   111.7599646274945
they are mostly foreigners scotch irish or danish   48.27229297599695
good answered harrison   91.75106299878819
de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art   151.7113921506026
he was a dead man   66.30374503094964
it is singular said d artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i can not yet remember   100.41799276790275
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards père lachaise from the faubourg saint honoré   126.976231430577
i will sign it to morrow   148.4559966955576
i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier d artagnan lieutenant of his majesty s musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that i have ever known   205.6083961019748
the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad   152.12567037511567
she must have confessed everything a woman is so weak   168.51202283835278
one hundred thousand francs for a loaf   105.69233640746523
de villefort relieved all dantès apprehensions   63.584026513650116
madame replied villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father has at least i hope so abjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and order a better royalist possibly than his son   55.995565212309
but the secret   160.7682930438353
lovely as the greek girls of cyprus or chios mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral lips   9.711708282580389
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door   133.29718443136497
i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years so i began to sound the wall   132.0980571127348
at these words he rose and put off his frock coat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his son s toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers   103.51724106133432
excuse me said d artagnan reappearing under the shoulder of the giant but i am in such haste i was running after someone and and do you always forget your eyes when you run   164.76249093723783
he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money   13.139945419983619
cried the lieutenant   56.925045133329455
de morcerf into the drawing room said he to baptistin while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase   298.38006219019985
we will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen   217.37058479245167
ah that s true   144.96329507219772
chapter xxi   233.97416727806407
and who is the cause of all this annoyance   130.73324205615125
but to insure this you must rely on me   41.96342113648437
because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of anyone   243.60798347081067
the devil   45.605819203444
said aramis   163.06354264759625
the whole world my poor child has abandoned your mother   134.70348646337217
remain neutral monseigneur if you find that i act as becomes a gallant man   67.56323239828149
dantès hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly together   59.261130904445
de laffemas whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinal s executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture   85.66283319979868
who is to know   123.8521109478939
for my part i wash my hands of the affair   109.13419982553178
look rather monsieur said d artagnan the clock shows it   119.97907167318331
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so   11.150464663099925
has your excellency anything to ask me   114.77927465917357
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him   40.00238975940282
and i even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for you   165.3922733310324
woe he cried to those who confined me in that wretched prison   115.84801290607395
oh where will be the end   124.55892213985301
be it so then replied athos sorrowfully   126.79893891000432
oh as to that monseigneur it is true said athos   150.25203952197475
well listen morcerf   171.15804491972364
above all if as i suppose it is payable at sight   115.47093992458727
shall i drive you back to paris   231.74177145485282
on his account i add two hundred crowns   98.6377536673725
you shall relate them to me my child   86.21134595347502
yes   188.9717864434242
i will complain to monsieur de tréville and monsieur de tréville will complain to the king   31.05422797964995
patrick brought the object desired which laporte recognized as having belonged to the queen   147.69150438624567
cried aramis transported   72.51573033009964
i have something important to reveal to him   165.40130351191613
50141m mercédès had never known misery   145.89081206554798
raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger   146.93239084463565
de villefort i beseech your indulgence for him   179.88642244258506
something of this i heard in epirus said monte cristo   220.13753739596928
what must i answer   177.8710865030326
i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i   155.29176827500265
yes if it isn t contrary to the rules   101.21470130495189
valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered   138.86768183370646
by her step she must be young   131.3738836506464
go leave me   53.44354409864395
this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim   55.80402841139876
yes   95.39186592990748
several strokes resounded on the door   42.466656413262115
then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to franz who read as follows the public is informed that on wednesday february 23rd being the first day of the carnival executions will take place in the piazza del popolo by order of the tribunal of the rota of two persons named andrea rondolo and peppino otherwise called rocca priori   102.02715170408776
then as i believed my husband would be at home i hastened hither   44.3962937204074
i do not think he is   197.59584454569466
let us take arms let planchet post himself behind us with his carbine   145.37871395524942
ah   136.55633338563476
where   107.1070760679781
ten minutes after he raised his head   105.40958128736372
i had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fight me   195.1296122983171
they were perhaps in league with him   94.45665801867227
and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them   136.02388834215395
coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities   151.51121236886559
yes i understand now to find one woman you court another   102.5942099395703
they galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward scotland   42.04557937074553
upon my word you did well to come back   120.03915826268097
said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville   102.0199687319933
she with a still smiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone   154.16635215789145
well m   144.75929985995793
it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and you monsieur you will not be displeased i presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself   81.74392194206794
well at the end of ten days you would have taken a centigramme at the end of twenty days increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes   59.29543366910117
oh it s only a temporary postponement replied aramis   19.757239366832977
the jailer stared   181.39290542560155
and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships   138.07610575674315
this idea while darkening his brow drew several sighs from him and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance   211.07992759666257
the same had been done for the queen and madame the president   111.37883623267224
in fact i will know him i will   236.0872190355165
i have sworn   115.44601850285606
they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dantès could easily read it as well as make out the sense it being in italian a language he as a provençal perfectly understood   86.61690851303757

you see very plainly that there is still danger for you since a single word makes you tremble   158.58974778918127
it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention   113.85610885081284
from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves   144.00673166177302
athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder   138.74529634025325
he approached the wall and tried to climb it   111.97769775335547
i will confess all to her i will tell her daily that i also have committed a crime   81.33869974753193
the confidence with which d artagnan spoke convinced patrick which was the name of this minister of the minister   117.78777920956031
read said the old man   36.74273113330753
said the same sharp and imperative voice   175.875963645044
and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our horses   25.703965027387156
debray secretary of the minister for the interior once a friend of mine   114.56914159421012

40262m until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down   151.5337643341389
the messenger is welcome   31.155685394358045
what then are you   94.3058821431713
he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their cloaks   137.76427335427448
e   85.66088089058044
do you understand madame   49.770570080835995
you understand this do you not my most precious wife   147.01839581478137
adieu edmond adieu and thank you   143.38171064219148
i get tired of it and leave it   142.6505187324165
but beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were conducted   174.153407407443
asked the duke   176.8753237944668
did not you know that my dear lord   132.61279003835259
you are poor are you not   155.2970035916025
the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond   177.69659084503232
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened   138.4655984331348
tréville s company   149.04897243170092
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged   86.22702341426759
lover and husband chapter xix   197.3127536646008
madame uttered fresh sighs   151.81996215604596
i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter   168.6041397258663
oh no sir it was expressly forbidden   154.5170903005118
pray try and obtain a small government pension for her   142.80600318073976
a man on whom we can depend i hope   9.100799839138134
it is here   28.491598640468553
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads   94.11869847895568
and madame de villefort   155.55163219139007
have what time you require dantès   23.067515153001864
but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love   139.4219585460109
sir said d artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side   173.21270985378524
we must do him justice he had had a great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them   116.2168694234304
said caderousse very uneasily   252.6465564521219
de villefort in a hoarse voice   141.1822387217302
oh good lord cried porthos what precautions for the study of theology   148.35370085658468
but at the first word the young woman started and exclaimed in a sharp bantering tone which sounded strangely in the darkness are you afraid dear monsieur d artagnan   129.55438527083626
inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saint méran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two   90.33399974259028
0056m yes   110.00035815707089
m   144.61415451997456
oh my friends said d artagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these gentlemen   113.88247712859811
when sir i tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish can you reply that i am wrong can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence   61.30662354010705
the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or lost   38.17180819546074
as for me answered porthos i wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates peers   132.2473103403594
he trembled all over   182.32664314673445
do you know what those three windows were worth   187.9777264834073
bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well   88.7887492718435
she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacingly for large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm   70.74272073333809
he took his fowling piece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure   120.82892574064648
half past six o clock has just struck m   167.2465646519463
i understand   75.08947580600417
morrel said dantès approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and i am at your service   205.8005697152449
yes   90.42138886093153
i   65.52301455265422
asked rochefort eagerly   124.85893866623312
she grew pale and ran to the window while mme   3.9857633689349967
the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt   121.23179545379293
i know that it is terrible said d artagnan   233.31804511462823

d artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself   168.32477853073402
ah indeed   103.92679811124327
of madame de chevreuse   32.41975408618825
you can t think how i have missed him the great simpleton   118.40634977673976
they exchanged bows and d artagnan returned to his companions   115.91887669849227
i know only one other woman who can do it as well   9.831107036236787
it is frightful murmured mazarin   111.27659032907523
the sergeant began to laugh   106.4007256245783
the first row seeing their sergeant stop stopped in their turn and so on to the very last   125.99669750008663
but the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow   144.273971891472
and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents   166.73723879117756
my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes   224.5628084085253
with albert   57.21427369905218
cried d artagnan the cardinal is about to visit the comte de la fere   185.06382519702325
after a moment s mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears   155.8385860076075
egad   198.75206655560044
barrois said valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you know will you open it   50.18421701339784
d artagnan took off the ring giving it again to athos   164.60087840353302
debray   45.602865482020704
the journey at two o clock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrière st   61.71604076751214
said andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected   153.6416119756968
there was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move   61.47574237370352
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg™ license when you share it without charge with others   168.15820277807836
d artagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it   194.062218181244
the child put the piece of money into his pocket   253.64035711022223
she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with her   124.64415750074228
it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another   149.17730546035193
yes   196.90939626860978
well my dear father in the shipwreck of life for life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopes i cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free   142.40646638987246
both   58.350570972628645
to prepare her system to resist poison   134.59536395749805
alas   135.99513737536444
but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission   108.62389527367769
cried d artagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress   185.59940541858114
at the same moment whilst d artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear   107.37149979553278
she made it her business therefore to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of france mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king   18.044331578689864
don t suppose that you are the only person who can serve me monsieur de rochefort   163.1421900657659
no no   145.11259977427665
ah   202.22747941055843
you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient   174.81537945132212
i have almost killed myself by my needless haste   127.2685156805882
let me also ask you a question   126.90142083613235
and the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half pike of the brigadier and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city turned again toward the bastion bearing with them the trophies of their victory   198.3478970671815
oh i made no allusion of that kind replied morrel   169.7134099811828
the room of the retired baker chapter 82   13.862317178564226
yes   137.90129739965124
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations   79.86595438166378
ah   59.402544855543965
but if anyone should come here the young girl shook her head   13.367755438992319
noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison   90.44267541878652
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared   89.39123703680647
so much the better duke so much the better said the king advancing toward the door   229.02667576160343
instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator   76.40170662612272
and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass   117.90039310743197
it was that of la carconte   157.14999324133908
never   93.69517654956832
and the crew   63.59860976876962
well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs   57.990688394442806
he took no refreshment   83.79275282114108
on you   110.38590463232592
said d artagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything   187.6672357889938
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me   186.41839928824908
m   66.45261016137988
tell them to take arms to come here and to run   163.32850528520123
well pardieu   87.29954942226034
well the english like good wine as you may know monsieur   202.67084769086148
we even joked very pleasantly if i remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest   199.76114981591482
perfectly well   195.23605633857937
before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistols one in front of porthos and the other of d artagnan   28.343602595373582
but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly   110.93107264914102
oh my lord   2.0302152767126387
only tell him tréville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he neglects me   94.81146598675421
as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited   220.05064964543635
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of   135.16669859010338
mistaken   91.26094287779314
i leave you bearing a remembrance of you a remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better   106.27205733533143
i have nothing to say that can not be said before all   92.19686012105176
he stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk   150.28074050859433
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself   98.2112553466124
we have all wished for this interview and i trust it will convince you how ill formed are your objections to valentine s marriage   175.5744415886357
that is quite another thing   98.37599434637154
by whom is it commanded   188.3749066710074
and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject   58.67356054531117
and he held out his hands to be manacled   96.16832368443293
yes   138.98172978256585
he gave her the same dose as the others and all was over for her as well as the rest   129.88297985899717
mademoiselle said albert replying to this direct appeal i can give you very exact information on that subject as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing the young woman is a greek   146.6375971316001
ideology if the count of monte cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of parisian society he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which m   90.10346962069157
you have not played for a long time d artagnan   253.9221311891335
this evening sir he replied all will be ready   18.9673631887523
do you think so sir   64.36662561177862
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them   123.95874332623131
you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself   144.04892605751206
asked the swiss   145.68377386511358
racine says   147.68159371565523
valentine held down her head   103.6385326095894
the third to let the enemy fire first   122.79536094522264
and the following afternoon at half past five o clock the young men parted   39.05862945160321
d artagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face   151.36762836382462
the château d if the commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on dantès right and the other on his left   46.75700955992333
porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a princess   11.510272190167
i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame danglars   171.42708083656845
yes   141.81098760634032
his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs   159.84171489384582
it is some superior officer making his night rounds said athos   98.15332558956914
and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper   112.11287043452045
and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there   40.01960100482687
but your wife monsieur what has she to do with all this   182.61069564815773
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll   86.60750944430465
come and open then   86.69561215321485

said he here is a strange thing   249.9762728878695
although i don t despise sweet things in proper time and place i found the supper rather light   94.93620013678942
you will wait for me then   175.16913510669912
but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at villeroy   140.06032301604301
my faith said d artagnan it appears that i was more drunk than you since i remember nothing of the kind   40.65434764510806
this key was furnished with a small iron point a negligence on the part of the locksmith   118.80321168355282
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms   68.91945981624625
because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride   8.181746962711387
said he what does this mean   65.93874312030594
at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance   91.37454081059943
then you refuse me   89.75720056945555
it was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from him   151.9468674890857
who s up there   61.78284719214929
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baron s right hand with his left and held out his other hand   104.32371641208086
she asked   171.29181469823385
salute my hero viscount   204.30588232646085

i comprehend now   102.58843579917074
de villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and bolted   176.710304344619
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows   130.29689594752728
let us return to the object that brings me here   218.96371623669393
will find on raising the twentieth ro   208.96927031663898
a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper   115.41956959588877
without you i was a dead man thrice dead   94.00109801593317
aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags   150.56438244805582
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four   87.35231073781199
is he in bed   116.81931973073057
i was wrong then no i said what you say there is a crisis at hand   130.3805671321474
two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire furniture   72.80719411744568
thou alarmest me   151.68758823592214
speak maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already full   113.13717496416427
s   216.18424669362582

chapter 85   123.19475515105292
oh heavens said the young man oh heavens what are you saying count   93.01916447117775
said albert   131.64823580226852
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis   165.3963929020968
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them   133.78833393030965
do you hear baron   20.84512403970814
ah you are awake madame he said   82.02047358388964
de saint méran   137.6044418978954
the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii   162.61706302887288
d artagnan and planchet entered pierrefitte together   111.18232402103399
dead on the scaffold   87.67996075538476
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass   94.99778249572388
morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission   157.3597536617271
there s only the price we are not agreed about   126.35585268952784
no said andrea no   128.32351090283157
hush hush   56.74623957850155
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped   177.03197987426498
said porthos it appears there s something fresh here   180.91100096241522
twere better we should not be seen together   130.45725795756232
let us entice them away   197.2612710663003
pardon me count pardon me   28.317520436436197
debray smiled   144.25531600254473
m   31.739876783018232
40050m the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably   99.16276272989452
i suppose answered d artagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much   116.83316732707003
the handle of this saucepan was of iron   80.32432043750589
the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest   108.57856138665235
i might even say that we have some reason to praise him   57.4040669551481
do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat   115.94379083902791
anybody may possess a five franc piece   130.82308196494378
he rose to return the salutation   106.31312363767996
a slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to d artagnan that the would be assassin had saved his life   32.87931461754836
i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter   85.5184449526118
and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears   42.8708325274182
you are a model for regular people   185.81170406814758
thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand   73.15602037807862
and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him   137.05035668030592
the groom returned to the carriage   63.938075766485674
the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self love and defeated ambition   129.97670315856038
is my lord pleased with his escort   76.31636843686803
ventre saint gris monsieur de tréville as the king my father would have said   124.06720438474368
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed   123.26973558445998
so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit   131.2115116859167

the minister s wife pardieu   71.66890191319386

and i am madame héloïse de villefort   135.85951990589666
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box   152.88023065697655
the marechal de la meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as henry iv   201.00475227736683
peste   75.04836316896834
but we always come back to écarté it is not only a game it is a hors d œuvre   320.85112961162616
as soon as possible m   143.5039657937529
the bracieux estate was a few leagues from villars cotterets   131.8213469793165
both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse   131.52355912122528
you have guessed it answered aramis   118.01316420776077
here it is   125.101212371782
of danglars   91.01368271079384
she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the place royale by the duc de guise   155.9110162333123
20025m the englishman smiled imperceptibly   196.16138833460118
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also   92.76701513644038
would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret   114.79132839771331
ecco   69.26265461426202

oh as for that i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are made   109.37097238310886
several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning brow   120.4911859852514
my lord he has been for three days at the rue cassette   48.05987337426495
0201m oh how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience   18.445415332699042
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest   102.52969251602904
do you consider her no one   133.45373541344074
he placed the casket on the table   139.17343410176386
pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools i am fit for nothing   102.48881371876644

felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the english had declared toward him whom the catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the puritans styled simply satan   91.82221861806562
my friend continued morrel you named the fifth of october as the end of the period of waiting today is the fifth of october he took out his watch it is now nine o clock i have yet three hours to live   143.2149016750178
nay answered monte cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded   171.92694953956482
well then tell him this rochefort   35.84840033510844
raoul was but ten yards from the shore   152.30846356599702
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on board   133.65343867058567
well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it   76.10902117868847
the count of monte cristo   67.3470774413721
you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20 000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us   94.60487172519177
that completes the 250 000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains   77.11838864283516
then he exclaimed turning to his men let them pass   54.42832522990845
the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell   131.94200196526072
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him   133.96625222598638
he reached it before the carriage arrived   173.52393792068074
now madame said debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about 60 000 livres a year which is enormous for a woman who can not keep an establishment here for a year at least   99.34314812826365
the old man signified that he recollected him   62.46244136824536
your excellency lodges at pastrini s hotel   205.93828561736458
and i did more than that replied morcerf for i caught one   161.92925017893225
it is some cowardly assassination said de guiche   35.10374643595934
mme   125.85828942009071
your interview will be private   116.78188504995826
corbleu   136.29539029519793
buckingham threw himself at her feet and before the queen could prevent him kissed the hem of her robe   198.98777419815474
well the man whom i offer you is a general syndic   159.84652763798854
he is traveling on business and will return ere long   115.55219187714832
now albert said he you understand me do you not   177.02104175553217
at five o clock anne went to the cardinal s room   28.283737827495287
noirtier made no answer   149.0482307597391
luigi slowly relinquished teresa s arm which he had held beneath his own and teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille   220.1203620961918
where do you wish to be taken   19.49471080795027
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude   170.2072764112831
his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person   174.32487334068162
this visit had infused new vigor into dantès   183.34660533734916
you have been to yanina   40.56033279696288
and she resolutely entered the carriage   108.55210630984496
valentine instantly ran down   14.849363248130032
i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly   7.034761315015146
étienne soon returned from his errand   106.12944706341084
you accuse him then   79.3224689708563
she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise   142.67717324801836
well that will do charmingly said the count   84.8263542516475
oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also   108.61037846523668
the guards asked permission of la ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however   91.13932132339406
what an injustice my dear invalid   151.582326552841
every one is naturally more or less devout certainly   108.45917660119596
bon jour messieurs   142.98534269433353
let us proceed therefore to the usurper s conversion   24.29956654256317
danglars turned pale   31.673463221745976
mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber   281.8544653172949
oh don t let us talk of that m   176.58516548727505
f   152.1435519651818
say on   133.19225114224068
yes replied the invalid   143.51381353684337
how can i   140.37936834409183
de monte cristo is as good as money   61.6923478147775
coward   14.01887980355157
this is an officer s cross   135.817846081523
he asked   85.4100991124585
i was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves   5.607833700648612
and where is that letter   188.09253679946931
i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor   161.3940927523752
how came it known   184.36595725533596
dantès entire dinner service consisted of one plate there was no alternative   128.04704930928486
let us see said aramis how are we to act   113.35894933128908
you can not tell me   136.47944219585497
light me   68.00169217317101
porthos paid his compliments to m   178.10735520764314
it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of america thus feels the approach of the serpent   120.85329666573458
but you received it with enthusiasm   101.3139306793993
nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party   169.22822524862414
come come   108.61750896626656
and that is a mousetrap   73.18365395940516
although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to speak   117.42651668750878
his face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle   39.47581219837976
probably if ever i get out of prison   119.23838716896583
a slight oscillation showed dantès that all went well   102.28201448973545
merri you begin   3.6484081048238863
thanks sir   96.25960196405183
athos who heard milady s voice came sharply up   188.42273447102633
after five and twenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles m   127.08676936657594
what is the meaning of all this   75.18791078069745
said the jesuit disdainfully   125.17109096427293
but you can easily conceive that surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion i desire your presence in paris to be unknown   40.93221411543573
but then all this extravagance is not for myself added athos laughing   112.79390085953528
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart   179.98952941221555
said she   136.07729747362214
those fellows strike hard and don t leave off in a hurry   160.27687343732575
i do not understand you   171.26116675200313
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink   39.87564304961231
from lord de winter   51.07756650387748
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound   162.29597581135044
but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent   108.82547212082444
hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of you   153.1817266311517
madame replied d artagnan i have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majesty s service and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you   144.10372850381154
will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hôtel of the duc de la trémouille and that they did not endeavor to burn it   86.9522089936645
i heard it from friquet   79.76889414867463
it is with valets as with wives they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain   86.53251191481269
mind aramis d artagnan smiled as he spoke since we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future   92.153997826314
let me carry it out and we shall laugh   179.11448403866248
come said madame danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea   42.134256388761315
four persons have been assassinated in the rue st   169.2528678588237
i was so delighted to see her again   115.23561309336903
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone   23.95223903291236
and is there no means of making him revoke his decision   170.28111995518668
and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once   85.26197514302476
the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern   138.42222319083837
why have you hated him   155.726389894492
houses were no longer to be seen   100.99686509086914
good morning benedetto said bertuccio with his deep hollow voice   25.90910126129026
then said aramis this falls out very well   176.68193786508402
four men traveling together would be suspected   94.05360870563148
you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time   9.791624381961185
he is cold said debray   14.888157280608098
mazarin reflected   218.19041759757278
she will soon pass   23.905872843558484
what   60.990302432931216
a jest   102.14398042791854
chapter 5   128.77276413295283
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served   113.91008425644429
hush   50.22875638216627
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements   8.861100028415848
i believed i had a right to endeavor to find her   111.69204192444035
haydée whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked you do not know me   140.75003313337444
gaetano was not mistaken   124.35854753062009
you arrive in good time dear d artagnan said aramis and by taking part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence   58.226021593781695
he asked   104.03679705000012
the most important thing was not to kill him only for i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred times but to kill him without being discovered at least without being arrested   125.01558475381248
no no   159.85036000596358
franz and the count got into the carriage   80.3532845595256
grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it   101.25165629283875
all the four are at your service   126.52115875472192
there he said is our road   75.08763685912575
cried the three friends   116.70376164470275
i have barely escaped   79.17560477680402
madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall   164.4871324508238
your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom i had the honor to speak to you   103.11728627472772
chapter lxxxix   49.77545053740053
d artagnan said athos with a maniacal burst of laughter guess what she had on her shoulder   129.83640078777609
suggested porthos incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people   194.70369320233544
ah i confess your excellency when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle i felt my eyes filled with tears   170.23628394471635
my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abbé faria   162.51001873756965
cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner   66.33617625753723
replied d artagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant   85.91604132239054
willingly said albert   50.20027005415858
they like to unite their fortunes   119.40728464719065
murmured the voice   71.84930014547308
i will do my best   103.95539918349928
the masks could not appear   124.72576170052221
no one suspected i was there   84.83807444470277
if they knew anything they would not question people in this manner said d artagnan to himself   85.60504337378936
ah true   174.55213973925004
true said beauchamp   92.25317115136262
yes sir replied raoul with slight hesitation   34.91086103183311
well now that everything is decided cried porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner   183.31818190909087
said villefort he is a noble fellow   206.76004753643022
i will have my eye upon you for i shall be there replied the cardinal pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear and on our return well we will settle our account   159.82297965144443
asked m   119.31592868639471
villefort s eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride   180.33350336061443
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father   94.1366816194949
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness   100.71023964079154
cried bertuccio   207.34154717268945
and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason   168.20507687966307
but since the end of the month m   82.91116174036864
i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word   94.52363691423692
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter   206.16576171129466
from a certain abbé busoni   203.49466723629854
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem   179.60321840718026
gone murmured valentine   5.483016407512437
it is her majesty s   83.68627182701194
doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry   43.03393841501884
after which if nothing new occurs i shall go and bury myself in my convent at noisy le sec   219.51674346857646
but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does   34.101975283212866
a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and half stifled sobs   153.17167412264982
the writing of madame de chevreuse   69.59646768899583
i am getting more and more seasick   126.84795753246829
patrick who knew lord de winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his name   184.28104884213195
good evening comrade said d artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner   78.58327068251285
but i require three weeks preparation   155.26831226645544
then turning to the governor observed he will become religious he is already more gentle   177.28973613274715
this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder dantès who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moment s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom   185.59726604977925
in person   201.8983864828898
cried the king   102.7245169786785
the decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the floor   132.43927811571032
what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker so fortunately become bankrupt   99.73517443123968
and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride   106.81301098661805
aramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest as they quarreled formerly over the musketeer   75.9080085017957
agreed   263.4046299376438
because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you   23.931700981719217
but we we shall remain   219.00305784678017
cried the cardinal a venetian glass   187.81452214772796
i must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water   153.69395631890396
he would then have about 5 050 000 francs left   150.80451171225582
it seemed like the fête of jack o lanterns   98.4474226789024
no doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre and would be allowed to pass   186.69747326659842
so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden   172.10230019259168
and why so   69.5943082957998
but let me see how was it done   115.23302642498162
i rang for a light but as no one came i determined to find one for myself   64.93764468158925
thank you count thank you said the young man evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation   109.30118527849288
oh yes   181.80274197217204
not the least in the world   160.9300608882108
milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak   167.6279600518056
but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then   102.15806982396406
what do you think of this counsel winter   122.08136345004702
i shall follow your advice not because you give it but because i had before intended to quit france   35.37547047910887
the horses impelled by fear flew towards the house   90.95068764458091
and what do you suppose is the count s age   113.60640408669703
is aramis here   110.94940585882583
yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant s shoulder   164.44042885247273
what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth   21.69233767520562
he asked   28.79809740709345
d artagnan became pensive in his turn   95.46724780595913
ah what a misfortune   3.2432199673394564
i shall retire and die tranquilly at home   60.80855558404666
the accusation   43.20711881366309
who can tell   91.55621502985665
or s blood my brave athos will die   70.42481474870544
m   89.05715494302315
good   122.1231766280278
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched   6.895924134068906
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge   110.10031373846047
franz questioned albert as to his intentions   165.52458561407315
he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and maximilian and emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within   184.76486660377236
and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to god but to man   145.87961290634135
you see plainly i can not walk   31.074247718263948
you have a sister   114.71732903633894
yes   76.78398525220811
yes and i will tell you   19.174159856972523
it was the fever that disturbed you madame said villefort   173.82447171140137
he proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the period   173.85162251962765
i do not hear her breathe   229.66597896243064
the scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows   126.80202005421603
where he was no one knew   51.155873012184756
grimaud said athos coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown grimaud i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak   114.29780183502976
tréville smiled   97.35467755148868
drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says   169.19219217411072
thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone   150.7560656932207
forgive edmond forgive for my sake who love you still   147.96497409540999
a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document   195.95577336204508
hear me maximilian said his father   148.63677661819872
laws alone swamp our small staff   155.9069785029827
morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude   141.21433624129372
because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son   285.9356085212216
what does the executioner   193.22416342129986
ed   96.18516166510426
as for my wife i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france   75.81358905407151
how can you find out   90.53853694349796
yes the king   70.98801533388342
is it you mordaunt   93.22540449269363
hem   179.03852581140455
for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her and providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty   121.46395905857356
let me look at that sapphire again   35.29701891666299
have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them   137.9538775472692
ah   80.1451355488503
he was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreams a coffer long and deep locked bolted fastened in the wall   147.54908833946604
the soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the carriages   73.16400387320988
but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake   69.61760867205706
and looked so strangely at me   169.1697742728032
i promised you a letter for the director of the academy   117.35845203553461
shall we go forward   219.6925064969521
and do you know the man who has committed this deed   79.98409018214403
not for a kingdom   148.6566825090733
i promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world namely by my mother   107.50342482172171
under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend   36.678474884540265
we see that danglars was collected enough to jest   86.47320011207717
then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time   211.14575701189654
yes   221.58132407163737
the italian opera is in london   243.34609945620284
it was the king speaking on the scaffold   84.2563265374096
ah his friend is with him   97.95157777327175
chapter 6   148.56400781500665
during the exchange of these two words felton drew back quickly and when lord de winter entered he was several paces from the prisoner   62.09182449644861
a musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe me   135.46479904753352
ah devil take it you speak in earnest and must have a definite answer   175.16298406860912
he then took franz s tablets out of his hand   106.58337094854335
you have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you   53.35090704003425
but what you tell me madame what you inquire of me is not the result of a chance query for two years ago you asked me the same questions and said then that for a very long time this history of mithridates had occupied your mind   93.55724238122392
and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped   205.9720294238686
he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence   129.84465671714423
yes   112.49725756268556
de morcerf   54.73601732048311
this was the more so because bonacieux s reflections were all rose colored   93.89066343424005
and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting cards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500 000 francs each payable at sight to the bearer   61.79122822647082
ah   147.52669057529005
all men are brothers said the puritan   86.39249428107257
by bacchus   171.62019124535024
pay no attention to it   152.74943182510057
then you speak german also   171.45229329456708
but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation i will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there   115.1535981606254
and when shall we know   148.14662417530798
you leave paris   148.65321842651875
but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone   165.17667619120743
be it so   66.99455646220338
the taking of la rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the edict of nantes   115.82412807933788
aramis blushed   88.4170119711034
germain   32.21342438865858
said athos satirically i saw him   124.01216088454159
ex major in the austrian service   37.5463680338911
two varieties of demons chapter lxiii   153.28061003853253
how would you set about it   187.25690365908903
do not be alarmed said beauchamp   196.23996648220486
moreover d artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her   116.39192011266468
sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least   251.58213740483606
and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune   111.52509144888359
well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man   83.38055451468674
he remained there fourteen years morrel said the count placing his hand on the young man s shoulder   7.7965235103291235
morrel s service and a most singular change had taken place in his position   211.2100554084932
we must play the farce to the end   199.136240651288
lord bless us   99.32819478297003
having said that they went out of the stable   146.45168518295458
you sent me away   146.25806211807782
and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble   113.92275398459282
such as is my supper it is yours to share if you will   76.43896302625654
planchet   56.26040217406262
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides comminges s troop ten good soldiers to confront   80.79573248556486
peccato   231.43264301698656
mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m   31.72322337528331
he will at once put himself at your orders   196.40566218022127
yes replied the old man   163.4037605625378
i see you are a model mentor said albert good bye we shall return on sunday   19.792405706215845
here it is said athos   119.76382945844598
there came in moreover two drafts which m   146.58801370215687
there   109.38652050453325
for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair gentlemen an affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be gained   203.03123922201465
the count bowed but stepped back   192.8485516039393
cried la carconte do as you will   211.31203106233772
this hole communicated with a kind of loft the space between the floor of the king s room and the ceiling of the one below it   13.810650528650157
you put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs   15.67137716756369
this was in fact a custom familiar to him   110.87742754537746
the morrels have been shipowners from father to son   180.11557625742043
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering   133.27227158617146
she worries me in england as well as in france said athos   177.26033552594583
the young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the new comer   164.37941948672753
she treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers   195.65543155784098
what asked the duke what do you mean   197.2184895416949
franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so   12.92095909756192
cried friquet you re meddling too   81.48308056590332
is it as good now   171.02352226189294
in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wife s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt   214.70360265609364
i was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of la réserve the day before i was to marry you a man named danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman fernand himself posted   7.329933095207409
yet thither it was that dantès guided his vessel and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day   114.45581901467109
mr   128.6801918321653
their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the king s room so as to form a kind of trap door   189.31043138967416
asked beauchamp   8.606390323389661
oh god   38.54363634224042
her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age   136.2519355228226
said friquet my fortune is made   76.51279018740479
but one   114.17840238338867
with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved   104.05848258850197
oh   114.09973272924877
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand   79.43412229860348
well then to my health   25.364307151543073
well madame said de winter when the queen had dismissed her attendants   118.87007168037312
half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down   16.652192508618256
he wore his elegant uniform d artagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak   81.83703457052289
although general d épinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments   98.44994424657669
you didn t tell me of that aramis   193.71313509421077
albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick   81.77784957410341
i left it where i found it monsieur   116.77485252062424
different in your fate from us you will have a king without a minister whom you may serve love respect   113.24597899538132
haydée s only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girl s picturesque attitude and appearance   48.24214546104922
dentro la testa replied the same voice with the same menacing accent   197.61821247200862
if you know monsieur de tréville you must have visited him   90.04085260282665
exclaimed the young man   151.33572598843926
but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised   111.28487614271533
if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it   120.32979475486407
and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it   146.8550821821666
monte cristo had pronounced the name of fernand with such an expression of hatred that mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every vein   110.66562889140407
which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of god   125.19028046920906
he was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive oil   135.3895265223055
de morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient   75.56754926457697
i am the queen   176.04303026298973
begone if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes   79.25108756872781
martin but by giving me the whole   90.10311439332868
but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name   184.0842689334972
then began his travels his duels his caprices   106.54282740664893
pray continue   72.66232898696124
for shame   129.0454946663522
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness   168.23435468791294
said la ramee   115.4406414896329
ali will drive   7.4058724296148455
permit me madame said d artagnan to reserve a portion for my friend   137.62329925937254
finally milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her lips   108.80704060309992
thanks my brave friend   121.28284159246054
you thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain   83.90820224227204
we have arrested monsieur de beaufort but he is the least dangerous among them   89.87423452401237
danglars retreated a step or two   75.24875053272925
the duc d elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty five thousand for each of the three others   89.4013807330531
yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards andrea and slipping a packet of bank notes into the young man s hand   162.84864185955604
is that all   112.62456579353967
once past the frontier andrea proposed making money of his diamonds   107.64666257758209
have you the diamond   106.98802763166661
let us not lose a moment   24.29244382283487
then your count entertains visitors does he   171.69526164535148
and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden jingle   80.03498009309563
sinbad the sailor   166.53038621810026
grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier   168.51159512371228
faith   118.13643601096379
monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him   84.5274528431867
eh rascal   59.62487311943549
and you complain of that   87.65836092258677
i could not seek them to my great regret   11.00459324264861
i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said planchet   73.02718231470183
mordaunt   36.42666432971028
in person and fortunately it seems for you my young friend   62.061286301387334
have two riding horses ready   117.98444614312432
ah i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man said mme   53.05606989151241
the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know   86.60929310475319
most undoubtedly said planchet   21.067808180465306
can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition   107.81630412077935
it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man s mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle   166.93366996355476
and as i said before let us speak of yourself   100.18077087406407
i once thought continued faria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight   71.52103019535761
if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe   128.33533944645026
i am always afraid of a quarrel when i am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it   184.03294756548274
he asked himself trembling more than the wind swayed cloth he was holding back   204.49812155183076
cried de chatillon   48.00647593391476
why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi   24.68190861100726
50223m ah yes   61.983969190942965
go out   115.00947567351243
what brings you to paris   108.30772663558402
unhappily those times are past   148.15593004280817
only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements   20.36654391609116
louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself   116.02776787935022
what has become of her then   105.73321292314976
i was going out sir   240.07745514838848
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down   96.55229368147333
no my boy no said caderousse   122.28961424382163
madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question   65.2843468311589
ali bowed his head in token of assent   190.22982174261608
but you should have inquired for the woman   56.1957327210064
what do you say   63.03126728120476
franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained   103.38329519938996
barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes   133.868003974692
to what do you refer   55.613979267888425
then all at once starting she cried my god   120.92679469909451
had a thunderbolt fallen into the room villefort could not have been more stupefied   67.48992532366455
i shall compliment mademoiselle danglars on her cameo while the father talks to you   165.5436556924467
i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others   147.90174938797128
m   117.84713745854113
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious   69.88986837017873
there is a visitor in the drawing room   122.81632053628016
no   177.13191771799535
speak sir   121.80020733989178
dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door   115.75608651603822
that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears death s heads and crossbones for in case of a surprise he was to pass for the phantom of the white lady who as all the world knows appears at the louvre every time any great event is impending   120.43266512951284
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly   74.22236868928631
and did you also discover a bitter taste   154.90371891636985
of her whose carriage was at the gate   153.37037799268967
but with what   91.45414937941781
is not his name andrea   6.865514241825977
have they not obeyed me   80.4635457488904
the president frowned imperceptibly   100.68277629052321
asked morrel quickly   138.4537138600315

aramis then joined athos and d artagnan who were consulting together   118.70870383705821
sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa   28.406350446938774
planchet my friend interrupted d artagnan you are really a precious fellow   152.96936349421622
turn to the left so that athos and aramis may see you clearly from the window   72.26156105681062
i took one of them by the throat and three quarters throttled him   106.98081358428998
gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear   92.50491655598151
oh observed madame de villefort it must be an admirable anti spasmodic   68.07716232583721
dear friend at raoul s age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real   8.805019121667428
some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more   51.68872049950677
said morrel   101.17820326053769

had doubled pomègue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board   73.05993963878436
i was wrong a hundred times wrong   169.35600653857503
he wore a mask   16.68143325878036
the treasure is in the furthest a   42.1390822696617
that was not the appointed hour   3.6766532286850833
no said she you will avenge me   113.87098618281138
what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness   25.555373655543207
ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers   104.67100211839991
then another important thing raoul should you be wounded in a battle and fall from your horse if you have any strength left disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed   70.34200145709818
at the sight of papers of all sorts titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me   77.31941202832655
and his predecessors   108.8806743786784
to travel perhaps   103.61931043815403
i am at your command my lord returned d artagnan   196.5602271250388
she is not faithless   22.113605914290247
have i sir comprehended your instructions   109.97308796658355
speak   90.19385464327848
yes   126.20429992925025
as for myself as soon as i recovered my senses i went to monsieur the governor to whom i related all that had passed and asked what i should do with my prisoner   105.26948489199754
it is you mordaunt he said   165.94939224859561
due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time   146.9767729779191
i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour   70.77429314115878
busoni turned around and perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrate s face the savage lustre of his eyes he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes   102.54629902471147
perhaps to madame de longueville   126.19243942314637
d artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life   98.09162805617186
pardieu if that is all i am hungry too   3.8820000801382264
at two o clock the tennis balls began according to grimaud s directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of la ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat   129.6649790623983
you no doubt stand in need of repose and i will withdraw   112.07202154696932
ah here is m   136.21212016211584
he then arose   84.18336116176123
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms   24.7394125522369
the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramee s ideas grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him   114.52057791947202
they put the stone back in its place   131.42072546343215
my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation   130.54348693493756
asked athos   205.7523632210237
here i am back again and we are going to be happy   2.864229055607481
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error   145.36783225721743
take care for i warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long i rip him up   56.79305803538455
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered   165.57593500418363
caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment   153.3809105826553
d artagnan looked attentively at the building   120.1029142404848
asked he   127.5207387383602
well at a few minutes to seven at a few minutes to seven   75.3645980795163
cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off   171.5655673066663
this account confirmed that of the mayor   56.00023211179345
the carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and square   188.28766182284693
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him   177.76190233229167
and rather from your lips than another s   218.84839766258796
murmured milady in extreme terror   103.85761724498587
well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me   99.30146443896861
i would give as much as a hundred pistoles   56.490004320833805
the more reason said mazarin   129.72270665505897
and in spite of himself the young man began to laugh aloud looking round carefully however to see that his solitary laugh without a cause in the eyes of passers by offended no one   115.0386940873314
stay   110.81159641904964
have i any need to tell you so   101.31082329613675
who and what is this man   102.10028249647716
then while madame de saint méran remained on her knees praying fervently villefort sent for a cab and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from madame de morcerf s   63.793256760467244
the moment of your deliverance is at hand   104.14538698830331
five or six days hence at the latest   139.4627106516317
we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons   3.1709377392196245
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur d herblay   167.9355006325938
and if he is killed well he will die bravely   75.68556888013444
we will return   171.58651142975816
said porthos   240.80938054079962
you have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels always followed by such happy results   82.29710137841647
willingly said the cardinal   154.49327992807758
therefore sire your majesty sees that they are come quite contrite and repentant to offer you their excuses   145.537078945432
but we can not swim to the shore   49.33525097906926
monte cristo took no notice of this ill natured remark   124.26757641145072
said the host   84.08601092213443
no no oh no   70.51023090059404
as to porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily known   167.68591301111226
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you   107.20574254837922
what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures   84.35999653302108
he will not escape the chastisement he deserves   207.57580767092568
i had replied the count   258.4747855901036
dividing the proceeds the apartment on the first floor of the house in the rue saint germain des prés where albert de morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious person   126.27115788805241
he has disappeared like a phantom like a shade like a specter   5.9063701701352755
exclaimed the abbé springing from his seat   156.36233894971826
ah   39.856861087117366
you will oblige me   178.80971938049984
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactor then count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend   131.67794730146127
the count of san felice pointed out teresa who was hanging on luigi s arm in a group of peasants   132.73933982966952
and the other i am the hammer of god in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed   107.49658798173719
and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth   52.12447038878649
come come calm yourself madame puritan or i ll remove you to a dungeon   170.62836231074704
we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838   113.85659586134693
raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed   57.551116445959025
he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punished   156.1485017892235
this is not to the purpose said eugénie   164.3103622518443
then you know that i did not leave him   88.75494550895253
as to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the window opened it leaped out into the flowers of a small garden glided onward to the stable took out his mule went out by a back gate ran to a neighbouring thicket threw off his monkish garb took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier clothed himself in it went on foot to the first post secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to paris   103.11047366457211
i have been in ill luck for several days said danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news   22.669919011808247
as he was passing the allée des veuves he thought he saw the count s horses standing at gosset s shooting gallery   216.04444732519494
m   76.28935059207699
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomas du louvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men   20.37873160227801
well you are right for if you indulged in such reflections you would never risk your principal which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man   296.87677467037395
for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not repress   204.2092891460951
you aramis know anne of austria better than i do   153.6881314650397
his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiority in fact the application of the axiom pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others   219.97345672052154
replied monte cristo shrugging his shoulders   78.26627625390852
is that his christian name   106.57097375174966
they then dressed themselves   163.122760704943
and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it   187.64686084138728
jesus seigneur   159.77389418097837
my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation   123.71011951920312
franz and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him   120.44236319178984
repeat what i have told you   122.06703905439932
athos smiled   173.84372808444394
de villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with one that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt   159.5606661389715
what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition   213.4886330291622
dear constance   120.09814499020149
you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours that were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery   137.22439735343735
it is your brother who sends this carriage   121.23127893416337
are you one of us monsieur de rochefort   95.86253026145799
we have offered any sum but have failed   15.940185182915855
and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along   2.2950278028038724
what in the devil does he say   107.06409209531834
i thank your majesty said aramis but under these robes i have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger   97.2027210655759
the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father s death   160.47660567490746
follow me said morrel   87.26964539043853
ah said andrea deeply affected   45.97265135239634
seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them   153.15381236787374
do you know him   124.58288417336678
you accept it do you not   54.28353652225845
here is monsieur de bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges   41.83592601263747
yes and no   160.08644148962105
on arriving at the rue des prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the church   195.97189377184856
of what consequence   140.26978229297117
i think i can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome saddle   165.9478954635017
then turning to noirtier do you hope the assassin will be tried   18.561784363255754
asked milady   98.9575278565764
is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine   53.566521065775376
d artagnan is right said athos   136.28741333931674
oh that s no matter replied caderousse i will go back with you to fetch the other 5 000 francs   143.88742715321987
sebastian where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing cæsar s commentaries and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six o clock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker s at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist   108.80886545488141
and has this man displayed a friendship for you albert   152.89282068405925
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs   82.31767085121817
he exclaimed jumping off his horse   19.518458313987765
he could read no other expression on their features   133.85056527048837
you will then have our swords with which i can assure you my friend and i can play tolerably well   142.2767183401706
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawing room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats   108.54760517848604
the hand of god chapter 84   128.46178665180838
believe me i know the people   18.313684066493195
you would have been summoned to the gate   57.21959169509174
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all   105.23243026414835
because nothing can save you   239.45876844404202
yes that is inevitable said porthos   8.62920863773175
à propos of the cardinal monsieur de tréville i am vexed with you   133.96726087897656
now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity   185.3491887293373
not in the least   121.07443700915394
a more material interest stirred his blood   88.65214210262245
but as we know d artagnan possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections   94.29535388922281
rest assured   58.947319937856065
your pardon sir replied villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men   49.84916756165836
my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this   155.77054480080443
for all that was done for our service   138.30823355983136
all is ready for to morrow evening   128.10187022961537
here he is   177.6251024347187
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements   178.4841322631145
at this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile   128.25781645230384
villefort you will not displease the marchioness and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband   56.614715482416365
30309m never   149.1069674719269
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinal s   177.71588322218838
his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face   166.6284205769171
porthos arrived a minute after d artagnan   61.051656639692595
no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin   138.92353051759258
why they induced general quesnel to go there and general quesnel who quitted his own house at nine o clock in the evening was found the next day in the seine   68.93826355748878
said a hollow voice   148.35468293829365
just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he said   193.46196346980656
aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal kissed the superscription with an almost religious respect and opened the epistle which contained what follows my friend it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated   138.94959532746753
oh my god   255.67736458213795
a very good idea porthos said the gascon   121.13199806200437
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so   39.97495120362365
if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable   135.0020476975261
the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage   81.28133383624254
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege   17.650549915799303
thought the gascon   118.44396836406754
asked château renaud of debray   25.75223910733827
but first listen to the history of this paper   60.763398014845876
madame danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the bank notes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocket book and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of consolation   77.90378191132848
de la trémouille   123.46088512225109
he is some spanish or flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol   79.93148211815296
you see there has been no time lost   134.2599703134612
why if you sought concealment did you call your horse vampa   261.97726277383344
no   243.06356460928959
i m no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own   24.174401372770745
said he   182.66876091248457
the astonished president looked at the jury who in turn looked at villefort   248.37637619339463
true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening   100.57711226318384
bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of money   152.01217038150565
sire i am here said d artagnan and i give you my word that if a single man has the audacity his life shall pay for it   135.01468737195947
that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely   4.560936576405581
she was married   179.21701486245098
it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life   153.45629454534847
athos and aramis left paris after this coup d etat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the parisians had been beaten at charenton   103.64730760312665

the cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king with an air of condolence very displeasing to me that the day before yesterday those damned musketeers those daredevils he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me those braggarts added he glancing at me with his tiger cat s eye had made a riot in the rue férou in a cabaret and that a party of his guards i thought he was going to laugh in my face had been forced to arrest the rioters   96.60750231177711

jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend   46.303777626145276

but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent   46.34570535508401

cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i can not remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold   217.61053425843517
adieu gentlemen said the count   207.21691590704114
such are my orders   188.32044469391033
and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris   72.80810397618436
de morcerf s   138.2650356913086

well my dear sir said danglars to fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy   142.12010462690185
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants   64.01932559588094
port wine   43.76220240816127
when they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say have you found anything   103.8263922544858
who is he   19.894899814307536
a croak answered this signal   120.84965573181825
tis true   164.22904255153307
well   110.07210933153506
aramis cried athos i am arrested   61.60156629905581
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service   230.63348871720356
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation   273.266833693357
they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other   38.44055558022332
then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued grimaud   55.95640201911817
madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair   123.91457327319263
said the young man i meet you then at last   131.2759699980319
enter and ask for monsieur bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room   123.31093788110076
the count inquired of albert de morcerf   53.83300853658793
thanks my lord   90.59990125510193
a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his eyes started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on one side his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful cries which however dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket   40.38520777247706
do you know where i am leading you   102.74793785684413
did i know poor dear edmond   160.7527700265345
he arrived in time   187.79402857842535
i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin   85.17008970436241
she is still alive and i am astonished at it   121.79648481242889
there are moments for if everything is not good everything in this world is not bad in which the most rigid and the coldest soul is softened by the tears of strong emotion heart arraigning sentiment one of these momentary impulses actuated anne   156.99407078543325
you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle renée whom i leave on such a day with great regret   56.10219340716575
he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape   160.47923064782032
adieu dear friend   161.99185687271535
you think this house pretty do you not   168.37498960900564
keep quiet while my master is being arrested   112.7581670073891
you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource   170.86615162825848
whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here   110.3483642795289
then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m   85.40813899314524
it glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck   129.23670465190511
near the carmes deschaux   163.03115308052048
if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thing a shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with ear rings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies   100.13006195650736
morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship   28.22664426391762
to do justice to them who had condemned me they kept their word   143.42118291169058
is it as hopeless as he thinks   55.693165356603046
my present happiness equals my past misery said the count   146.23597556631478
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him   108.11911728026675

if it belongs to monsieur porthos i wish him joy   199.85876432529219
you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest   152.10572681903363
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around i recognized the honest grimaud   34.50031892554142
i never swear my lord i say yes or no   27.704872717283067
they are yours   86.18550576331953
whilst this scene was going on d artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze   104.226317732534
and a magnificent one   26.71037106598665
surely you will not refuse a comrade   112.01658201640961
oh   22.18241003416614
he hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of athos whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him much   100.14583991767765
the two young men bowed   88.78753100165864
50111m my dear m   136.63409299555272
d artagnan returned and again attacked him   110.77028434159881
but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible possessed that ever existed   166.45114213557633
but then there must be some occasion for speaking   236.68322738425675
yes said athos magnificent   103.70097250222881
certainly   104.06877412290794
have i not told you already that i had nothing to do with that   137.40172871342827
in the country   181.01814699139618
she had heard something said about supper   59.50554359217458
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage   168.79984127147793
albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up   105.44112577752594
said the queen you bring us three things which we have not seen for a long time   183.56230847256882
oh the champs élysées   74.56756921276173
very good father in law said cavalcanti yielding to his low born nature which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it   49.191930282701534
the count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge   101.72864613822196
this announcement was received in silence   90.95180562151981
well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross   138.90170815741104
cried porthos with a laugh that shook the windows   150.84944984498722
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter   128.22393727600615
and the disappearance of his money   92.43536479361008
for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master   53.4949749971367
the next day just as debray was signing the deed that is about five o clock in the afternoon madame de morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the coupé of the diligence which closed upon her   130.48874835561196
i have therefore chosen this drawing room where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mother s and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals   118.04601167074141
viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you   1.725932751138373
i am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested   76.89130810637278
but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is   112.89973719429695
a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird   143.49940158891945
it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves   132.061267688611
what is your opinion gentlemen and does not m   132.47843770402562
porthos   125.2217386269435
yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion   125.31743301692747
but as considering everything he can not accuse you openly and as hatred must be satisfied particularly when it s a cardinal s hatred take care of yourself   233.4558748351516
do you know   94.00712479084642
when they entered d artagnan s chamber it was empty   117.0644141956198
the city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed   146.7402500038803
he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united   98.07463437109644
your excellency has not stated the number of guests   119.6581770789275
d artagnan ran out and returned directly after   97.76991676165207
my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart   143.6619026872484
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him   96.38785274260115
lieutenant in the king s musketeers   189.72303654609232
for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the cellar   143.27094318057684
the pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression   147.76448463178548
another had done all this   122.97704075673046
the shutters were only opened to admit a minute s air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice will there be another funeral today at the procureur s house   200.81985963091904
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there   188.18576088904592
you monseigneur   116.70474521268363
strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life   118.43847994244486
three of them stopped after an hour s gallop and one fell down   143.21826083993756
indeed   23.471429654624828
to wait for me   81.88194185815158
and if you deceive us well it will be the worse for you   147.05939913550029
chapter xi   116.448405230264
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole   120.16239984279713
it is now noon   121.37696549712524
still the beatings of your heart   3.184499788183203
sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score   87.31437367317213
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances   99.87978757594686
now s the time   178.6708932173231
how misfortune humbles a man   144.95832265589686
the baroness danglars   38.84346739113563
tis a noble gentleman monsieur athos   99.01548915710845
the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream   71.45856851222521
d artagnan looked at the envelope   124.52981211535258
well what do you propose to do   63.96190120229659
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly   132.981678117631
they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue   157.0291594613005
go said he in a subdued voice and find rochefort   184.758223866119
i know it is a weakness said caderousse but it overpowers me   100.48832029397273
what my god   173.98312533865393
maximilian said she maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven i entreat you do as i do live in suffering   67.78705560503369
i am that individual replied the officer   86.32720400326991
these last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them   135.14935216977344
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole   66.88650581744162
a kind of steward appeared just as d artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount   131.15883474381877
it was for his sake she has committed these crimes   204.00667412711118
the abbé sank upon edmond s bed while edmond himself remained standing   117.67670232786476
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes   129.17705914602186
who is this young person m   112.78641156416509
mon dieu   37.90469504754368
i am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the duke of buckingham to him whom you allowed to be assassinated to the duchess de chevreuse whom you suffered to be exiled to the duc de beaufort whom you imprisoned   203.75185701313896
at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside   92.59782583644278
the ever new passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death   162.03889166403997
although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep   205.08565427428806
and you receive silver from that man   112.41704617100943
but my reverend replied aramis a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head   147.95470987212065
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other   154.72004382899158
make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up   67.95542960603576
see what an exordium   49.57165126805924
athos then said to aramis   114.80988784101612
said d artagnan laughing in spite of himself   229.3538170160695
his hands gracefully placed one upon his hat the other in the opening of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous   165.89037176131217
noirtier s countenance remained immovable   59.70092411819592
the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while monte cristo re entered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan   130.9938341482414
ah   88.71837439381184
you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal   181.89427670502758
ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others   97.69272590607518
in that case felton would escape her for in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary   135.69463224370475
i am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well   126.12248000226117
a ball had passed through his breast   58.18008331905924
it will be the surest plan   92.88086054650093
but do not speak and do not listen   144.4268349163576
oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself count   188.41688843899317
not even that   148.0047198137857
then he determined to go up   123.81771580828047
toward four o clock in the morning the doctor arrived   81.70187975278701
the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger   24.84330977632753
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir   25.577841455343005
i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since said morrel   138.96499838019056
no i do not dance but i like to see others do so   54.23396834036352
the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward   66.574100180349
shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend   68.0711150282132
these gentlemen are with me said winter   112.76277770707729
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord   114.45385832007314
d artagnan therefore followed mme   72.34730306010417
de nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a king s attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been enceinte six   111.04534786652094
in a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle   55.95193747110739
he resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was finished   64.25675416346064
monseigneur is correctly informed said d artagnan   179.24890933914466
happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach   84.78847342580553
i beg you to return me that dispatch   118.73870529296539
you confuse me replied athos with his gentlemanly air   117.69700921831617
however i have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say   142.37861833295378
nay indeed your excellency   161.0508492046106
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious   70.55469375765571
and if i do not possess that talent which your smiles prove to me you doubt should i not still have that ardent love of independence which will be a substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self preservation   88.532077493341
the pretty madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing porthos s words for she thought the scene with the swiss was about to be repeated   149.58999404326278
between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of morcerf   91.95038032045073
then you will appear   63.2632795497042
and what a strange air for a victor   117.8114336052675
this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon greatly   155.03152760270405
then i will not leave you   187.3308016081778
get me that proof and i will send him to the bastille   95.56074339960551
what are your excellency s orders   173.5626068388254
no i was deceived   104.15479565386997
at once   92.2176075126643
you may call on the notary m   98.55124486208723
in those times panics were common and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind   79.95258850200958
i find england a charming country and i stay but on one condition only   142.39750983153073
is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir   120.35069304929887
but this second letter said athos you forget that   51.050602904443764
but morrel saw nothing   212.7701016124367
tis you la ramee   92.54774729348938
i wore a long sword which cut like a damascus you remember it aramis for you always called it balizarde   211.54166985407966
but it is your own fault   159.30466174085362
certainly i see him   178.37154892376122
the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio   116.98244651158159
i will follow you   167.7143432045354
see him there cold as marble and proud like his father   57.40392854538762
parry was not wrong   42.33282948933747
said the voice   211.41805290445797
man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed   14.850063624272593
the captain was only waiting for his passengers   147.35689361400793
i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained 400 000 francs by it of which 100 000 have been honestly paid to you   18.75743791184948
added athos coolly   182.0685442595951
said mme   175.63832378508158
some highlanders were listlessly keeping watch   37.59531749238194
and pray asked franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage   13.148266770256981
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded   157.2526192939775
i neither ill use nor ill treat my servants by word or action   114.86534821220869
for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button hole   94.46040261756328
the frenchman asked for a rendezvous   177.24506284137698
bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the louvre   103.89708116213644
de villefort to come but have not much hope of seeing him   118.10734866397833
do you know him   122.14354220279282
he then motioned to his wife to take leave   128.58099035104422
and you say this treasure amounts to two millions of roman crowns   105.70006148068778
that knife was for you my lad   56.13374135021282
i say i believe such is the case i do not affirm it   146.7296986914708
bad weather   67.02405900040077

oliver cromwell has annexed his income resources   143.27691340883368
have you seen the king   146.3528390190114
and i myself would aid you with my prayers   65.42913047389129
de villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to humanity   71.30388837754933
but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is this thomson french the roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me   159.2247482717474
these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron oliver cromwell   116.33679464774902
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon   140.33482500229331
i trust we shall never find it so in our experience   181.56221555371195
at nine o clock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night   57.73024078044182
i shall pass through those who attack me   145.09886385231226
because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute   174.25770152183912
i did say so   205.7954057455247
but continued d artagnan how did you escape   48.920508207894
egad   74.10787225760544
the house servants with the carbines   219.46777088321352
oh yes replied andrea laughing   221.36332733453156
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there   121.26037534290472
asked porthos what are they firing at now   82.97736429802293
you asked me for five hundred men did you not   133.91777207656054
both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay   62.60388861512392
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinière   30.667204319880597
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape   119.99422730583174
dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession   81.66775612886448
they parted   110.08662109915912
he consented   130.77936654099207
yes admirable   162.49380440226173
get down then and quickly   42.5974133855466
i think not   147.11363337587
her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable   151.3902094869432
i have to weep over the grave of my father replied morrel in a broken voice   133.52238337760332
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door   159.60130658815885
he kissed her hand tenderly   138.2314661427392
seeing you constantly surrounded by musketeers of a very superb appearance and knowing that these musketeers belong to monsieur de tréville and were consequently enemies of the cardinal i thought that you and your friends while rendering justice to your poor queen would be pleased to play his eminence an ill turn   85.98598892508392
i was only speaking in reference to the second rate fortunes we were mentioning just now   73.70710430557335
beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young man s paroxysm of grief approached him   111.50321554551968
according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body   214.25525658336687
roman bandits chapter 34   93.19100429505005
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her   163.43283284254667
but you don t know us   55.17780673958731
alas madame   48.65872237983966
i have affairs to settle   99.3629291692217
asked mazarin turning pale   66.41050560066492
did you see poor barrois die   157.46949434239679
then i consent to cut throats with you   179.84947452809956
you have seven martlets on your arms   110.30576605982802
for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than i do myself   82.76747371647524
and where is auteuil   160.49470241795703
de tréville grasped the situation   118.73864846090112
is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him   176.75988688587225
but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen or to express a single doubt to the baron   106.40659177460114
grimaud silently swallowed the glass of bordeaux wine   148.3867846895136
he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory   38.10925092091637
as a punishment   211.18770024490163
ah my head   131.07161812626393
you do not believe it   119.02843818673816
at the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number 1   123.89416045590424
how far is mazingarbe   42.08486792615378
has the law any eyes to witness your grief   56.54891161740975
athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person   131.33878365208543
and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur de retz s appearance   81.65917005975399
but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her will   122.4493616279917
you know porthos i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends   162.09854608738902
grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and double locked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure   43.00164030256511
indeed   130.77379488442125
asked d artagnan   235.08191720825243
and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions   174.36721528217646
if that be the case said d artagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another   42.78391143482291
yes   127.23004470227134
none whatever   196.43811913474647
no   10.095984934297618
ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man   136.89064118575538
in each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be levied   58.842285811804075
i know it   74.020945126921
let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours   169.54538719054761
because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his   186.123530555733
let s see   81.32044727045073
you have cut her to the heart   176.1995357189374
let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre d hotel noirmont has purchased the shop of pere marteau well   102.95634533128975
are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks the augers of the persians the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society   120.10195423487478
really   190.0147181462865
what would you have planchet   80.47588652182822
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commenced by the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it   133.94118921382955
i will be there   229.5233813247139
and yet you laugh   194.37219255889397
a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i can not break   158.855263250565
yes there is the sky   176.02871116676573
at the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads   64.88073273239407
i am not much of a hand at figures so that i live almost from hand to mouth   85.70081638181432
they had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries   196.2663192615568
de busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his company   25.576243370171724
cried albert in the midst of the general surprise   100.84384220209225
said porthos brightening that s well as regards my horse   110.37381014190447
in person   36.94670417386716
are all your family well   128.27690163542908
said charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault   135.75010345074276
impossible   140.9124957225882
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a snare   65.66693924075341
this is the case said d artagnan   125.0408761347689
you will have pity on me   41.5456326002065
lackeys   113.42425876692575
asked caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count   106.08227009114879
cried d artagnan   121.71538558412125
i am quite resigned   122.9912778419243
we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship s service and his most faithful servants   100.36089656082797
ah ha that s it is it   34.42260965213556
de wardes with such terrible coin   41.69161562375015
replied the young men in chorus   107.65295384419053
cried porthos   80.79816760387834
of the arabian nights   56.9312807425536
really one might suppose he was the only nubian they had ever beheld   74.66417904918208
yes two soldiers   141.91194408047346
bravo viscount said monte cristo smiling   173.16276747307637
the name of your ship   200.17317462556076
but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much   190.94612739020852
but the queen will perhaps refuse to obey   98.61664091641046
and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use   105.54439385763501
i have won five pistoles of aramis   119.19877284392479
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else   67.22280705587826
after a long talk with the harbor master captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind   210.082282266503
and since monsieur le curé can answer for you i answer for him said the curate   99.62454331737648
farewell till we meet again said aramis as they took leave of planchet   71.6660488369498
mockery muttered athos savagely   81.28396341751207
0145m no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon   77.28715543984183
what does he ask   111.88372772117384
no   108.5272924314954
muttered the four friends exchanging glances   83.1477908309602
did you not yet know me   140.20305224765815
i feel it monsieur and that impels me on   109.06692205996495
scarcely more   129.02986657766988
this is a means of communication   71.28590792582489
that is cruel indeed   68.05301610565357
may i venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence   38.32207639979441
noirtier raised his eyes to heaven   8.137606664734278
athos was right   99.50122347686977
the devil   141.5814565294957
well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at paris   101.55610061418916
at length the reading of the indictment was ended   145.74523749662168
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself   134.82191086905829
the travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption   134.17257742115427
but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage   196.35046627569517
so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living   210.29648355297394
because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking   214.5909794001672
what have you come for then   126.76139407452295
sir said planchet i am in all things at your service   67.44770016371066
he found her in a charming humor   158.483740138334
there now said eugénie while i change my costume do you lock the portmanteau   61.82231298951512
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least   249.90657391578307
he had forgotten that   97.92101648310839
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family   156.92273610042562
and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections   101.55078794176983
concerning a court intrigue chapter ix   118.03892614653688
though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his grief   15.054503344341995
said he   97.32821155492684
i do not ask you of his origin but what he is   52.00652480695497
then open the door directly   48.73448702658004
i will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but i will arrive before they do   96.15236701398
but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name   168.40421063771512
milady listened   143.98758219737672
she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone   222.61420779338164
the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile   91.10702219747272
58   128.96298572457314
as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices   21.07306785026816
make inquiry   174.76775220171078
asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy   219.79946141469708
he tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through   177.1772551952373
what has put this into your head   99.84322778588368
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects   131.5825785569198
mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful   191.98058995336623
at this moment comminges rushed into the room   78.20310786199173
asked athos   191.00819392159553
tis true that mercédès is not actually my wife   9.210859086049112
but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed   37.995020485944195
like a patient miner i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence   116.76350475020179
very well   181.94655590396752
i don t need the quarter of such a sum i who am still only in the guards and by selling my saddles i shall procure it   145.79873584109544
nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarin s compliment   177.1104657767717
but then you understand madame coquenard a mule with feathers and bells   46.33023407441581
you do not believe in god when he is striking you dead   117.7737511108977
ho there my friend   169.22146799472978
now what is it they want to know   228.24606136150004
in fact the count s face brightened   43.8687917136276
chapter lxxxiii   40.8306207401545
for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there   144.84482645111024
f   242.90971595282048
am i to be captured   139.19406243375016
yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge   151.85615800689877
had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them   158.86124336414088
said the old lady   89.06818051195617
edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m   172.4460941035082
here said caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy   84.29497802025563
as for monte cristo his head was bent down his arms were powerless   117.25637131883383
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know   185.53136258389043
from la rochelle   177.81436896947358
gondy related to them the insults he had received at the palais royal and retailed the jests of beautin the count de villeroy and marechal de la meilleraie   104.36448605699789
morrel had to pay within half an hour 287 500 francs   196.9663707903711
m   29.33582402590639
have you persuaded him to seek his fortune   77.41806764648356
ma foi said monte cristo rubbing his elbow it s all your servant s fault   86.32772594222169
one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne   48.71157311951565
yes said mme   65.771756951133
pray excuse me madame replied monte cristo but i never eat muscatel grapes   142.06939434415818
replied milady   86.22017200702533
the jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire la carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest   89.16825543497143
but jest as he might he gained nothing   159.3992557068638
oh a day and night soon pass away   38.56834536087584
i slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed   77.7924281152721
the hypocrite   124.13314807203903
and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed   50.53867416167539
parbleu   165.3232956239855
i shall pass by blois   142.14625291002477
d artagnan determined upon his course   21.21899816993225
madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing   24.73279555056027
you see   155.03321477868425
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors   50.005532862142886
well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which i offer you so much for the world   52.43657387502412
that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening   192.64952476458905
i will do it with all my heart said comminges   136.44582733632103
they were the heads of the two soldiers   143.6709327762266
they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more   77.42067691229381
the sentinel who was relieved at six o clock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him   122.13850140441326
i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and forty eight hours to stay there   128.65025555951186
stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit i am in it   119.8101809782221
someone will come   81.23232854209394
madeleine s brother entered d artagnan s service   159.90515049188497
villefort s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and franz was stupefied   195.2713045764053
bonacieux against buckingham but above all against d artagnan projects lost in the distance of the future   221.9392405946599
the woman was english then   37.55649991608365
when he affirmed that he the cardinal was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue   83.71294643678134
yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone   82.11692145401098
and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said debray   168.77521390604443
and the illustrious what s the name of the lad whom i made a sergeant in piedmont s regiment   46.237614476238576
franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to m   249.79159509451944
i ll circulate that saying be assured my dear fellow   85.02495541759669
as he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations the door opened and rochefort returned   152.21093734405846
god beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their reward   161.23606542462446
d artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to athos s and according to custom related everything to him   81.8084592960022
but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly   121.31781116016964
it was stopped by porters horses and footmen   136.4455273192162
you had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness   35.148781653221704
do then as i did my lord   51.24091126279127
and they pursued their road in mournful silence   34.372821550293054
cried the king   57.64221715319516
and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family   177.6269364867238
vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars   212.5062314045881
upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes   106.04248836972793
at these words he threw me a crown which i picked up and he took the ladder   203.62431411953168
impossible   28.002832571149796
they are no bigger than cologne flasks   190.49191824493184
to them or to us do you mean aramis   152.26820777084126
a man or a woman   102.23111437062119
it is nearly eight o clock and at nine i expect a visit   52.29315333537892
chapter 13   109.66503330146173
do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur   75.20044424607758
franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned   96.46846621819057
she was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of sleep   174.49302319500995
you must stand in need of repose   198.2920618320128
grimaud placed the pie before the duke who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust   125.43229643839044
i reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then i replied listen i have always heard of providence and yet i have never seen him or anything that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists   195.58298649065523
there placed between two rivers on the borders of scotland but still on english soil the tents of a little army extended   141.57984674892674
admirable and dogmatic   191.4128684852467
that two hours after the messenger has set out all the capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be arrested   246.9723007028192
the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation   111.34298910783588
he was masked likewise   20.383842401219397
and i said porthos rolling his large eyes remember i will skin you alive   4.006044848715234
he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner   201.13876204351374
danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew   180.1175413161618
athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man   135.6897055533675
an awful sadness enveloped the heart of charles   142.30053682104418
four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time i shall be absent   174.0389466620881
then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed   82.68269219811268
tell me what it is replied monte cristo   64.13317955820284
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france   51.4998463625753
then give me that letter madame said the chancellor   135.27248530590043
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion that in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me   59.519914910676434
she moved with the light free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian   66.95105851692429
its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood   169.74789396428264
morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his forehead   84.3266452527909
that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs   17.123317606887213
i do not like to be kept waiting   268.0265629828235
and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti   53.68746904077153
next morning d artagnan was the first to rise   72.31879270685339
it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police   77.69812783148313
she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless dear m   111.41867697213571
why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need   121.023810929982
i am acquainted with monsieur de putange   22.024439928295863
the cardinal said so   122.4472138069246
i will be silent but you must endure your captivity quietly   156.83322397036017
they appear to be numerous   160.1124288038959
i am eager to see you attain your vengeance   141.0000275749538
exclaimed lucien   130.01511396923814
0035m yes here i am said the young man with a promising future and a little money   124.56559086861796
but now about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol   100.17969806368808
while you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him   158.2376224758313
nay that he can almost work a miracle   111.04968451846594
d artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform   150.49832101447302
and already at the cry of moccoletti   163.3765910026042
how so   36.0153789693006
de villefort if you do not strike first   103.46304849883
yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome   201.93159815685772
this wound   161.81765786976374
but look   107.8249026282361
milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head   103.9953491911986
women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris   94.55682760065307
truly the parisians are idiots   169.0732861967249
it is very ingenious said the count   207.7968229994732
with all my heart returned albert   161.64357555829542
the woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice suppose it s false   25.0640168133815
i swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for mercédès by the life of my father speak monsieur said villefort   27.645822883386728
did he die   63.1116624391003
in short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair i now fill made an engagement with cardinal richelieu to cause the duke of buckingham to be assassinated in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d artagnan   221.03688072919257
at what hour does the examination take place   106.40194624457762
athos porthos and aramis you are looking for them   71.5436641081678
begone then to your beautiful duchess   146.2989338125663
that is when i have lighted the match   19.619215026770604
spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements   181.27433257138
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information   113.73339396392987
besides he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition much keenness of wit and as to suitability m   143.96311305309987
m   174.7447197432523
and as his head is valued at a thousand roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch him   184.24348509868656
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive   129.00926011071394
zounds   96.4806544592767
and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss   126.44124013134235
pardon me   126.05371599624918
you can not imagine mother how beautiful i think you   156.27761344864513
how   181.33934405270728
i swear before god who seeth us and who in the darkness of this night heareth us never shall my sword cross yours never my eye express a glance of anger nor my heart a throb of hatred at you   47.932258217901435
very good said the major i do not demand more you understand your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it   88.48703667802937
then internally if renée could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator   87.38526867563718
if you wish to learn more address yourself to m   152.23909028396494
next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested   201.175825030189
the comte de la fere inhabits the castle of bragelonne in the environs of that city   69.85026823159528
courage   80.51467912040155
baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the letter   137.1757339342379
we are going to rejoin that good fellow porthos   47.653769893980495
that same evening m   104.41772902920098
you know to what i allude danglars it is sacred   67.53938054980172
nothing easier   163.4172741250694
you know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order and her will bequeaths to valentine the entire property of the saint méran family   109.77504117677888
there was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which d artagnan bowed as a sign that he listened   41.40373511475606
felton was a puritan   32.282211372678375
felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted milady a last time and took his course toward the city   145.15710179468644
then let s count our money and divide it   121.23353701272433
from the queen replied the servant   62.291904720287654
i expected him this morning   199.8421125864142
said kitty blushing   6.834077045678541
i kill my son   94.7861995198371
asked albert   1.728592937570653
but as soon as i let go he will howl again   214.55896308058485
prince cavalcanti where are you   176.8460422708476
my god it is i i and this fellow who will help me to avenge myself   100.94514363463927
in this garden mercédès had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty four years previously   100.78245110731763
and as a proof of what i say here is mine in my pocket   162.72184964947007
good said the brigadier   133.93597337007503
can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last   161.01272837203697
seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs   132.31136674777724
dantès nevertheless determined to make for them   171.1897080176339
open sir she said and look for yourself   158.76255110028453
as your excellency pleases   171.68329297951385
said albert to the count   191.35748970603055
yes this self of whom i thought so much of whom i was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the château d if and whom i had succeeded in making so great will be but a lump of clay tomorrow   182.62271674360437
i   7.967858980255002
he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the queen   139.96097420180868
after that i ceased to blaspheme but i cursed my father   128.20647993734923
no more than a drop of water in the ocean   107.64299191305757
said the captain   80.0012548318355
if you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the trouble   42.931830169575065
as for porthos s coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two   148.49154714961247
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber   171.1493014815275
chapter ix   80.34931597093059
well be it so   135.82793555377177
well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right   100.17347199058176
and the two friends began to laugh   138.0455339953965
oh thank you sir thank you monsieur broussel said friquet   95.1525480953039
de montbazon and mme   40.82351615422813
disarm him only make sure of his sword   68.9941245931
supposing the assertion to be really true   129.99638824962943
listen my dear girl said d artagnan   194.16455147381185
that french officer yes   229.66930098338494
de tréville s stables one for himself d artagnan and one for planchet and bring them to athos s place   122.86591150718228
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire   173.8857973057716
alas   145.8595776169851
but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery   95.8573804689529
they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched   117.85704358529222
this evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate   182.63148439968307
my life belongs to my cash   164.13016824488255
how so   107.85987060243018
danglars   132.3996299783966
you can understand that one of two things must have happened   106.3777211486126
the carnival was to commence on the morrow   99.87565180871563
well in the first place here is my chisel   23.386832083527196
she loved villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband   194.66290664433012
it was done on purpose for me i am sure of it   113.97778127723615
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening   118.8128726403199
my god said she what a senseless fanatic   140.5213368641102
it was only to fight as an amateur   133.62294179670096
d artagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep   79.20558979520092
here   59.76937688237452
is she your daughter   3.6472015575293
the two friends saluted the duke   47.03871837818886
he asked   135.2731950133124
said the king   210.35600149153308
he himself   73.41918852984212
i recognize him   79.57559301873931
all he possessed was 15 257 francs   71.6951132890052
on the contrary what can you mean   31.007777470938635
my friend my dear maximilian do not make a hasty resolution i entreat you   54.94462634687407
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist   147.57617676453833
and now resumed buckingham looking earnestly at the young man how shall i ever acquit myself of the debt i owe you   166.5915965397885
but by jove   143.30516680843957
and slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court   88.96825639051413
should your hand still be too weak to use this sword raoul so much the better   117.96006995218109
said athos   52.31181121714626
cried madame de chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips   158.38258327812633
we will have him informed that his sister in law is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of her   128.95622525002332
nothing more certain   220.0217474578691
at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectators romans italians strangers from all parts of the world the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius   201.63945224445493
i really must ask you to excuse me m   129.47522554943205
it was d artagnan who now shook his head in his turn   140.48601594640988
the cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study   123.34113514379895
there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three   153.29989215338765
repeated madame de villefort   43.10334740297495
peace be to him   101.02089710144665
he asked   205.5054103640524
the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step forward   138.42968545789088
here said she you see i have thought of everything   184.3306706983667
planchet was equally seized with admiration and said no more about going away   94.46667989031829
silence for monsieur porthos s idea   217.28367540817945
at eight o clock all were in their places and m   109.19453215726206
maximilian you are no ordinary man   67.41084134875916
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here   125.32543270807257
at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased   186.2001888769069
but you shall not kill me today   138.25306633077827
no   11.648307313031026
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men   121.82709542797132
you were speaking of the champs élysées just now worthy foster father   37.70937257062414
here is my passport   89.09066729131929
mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him   112.5637016436336
go and tell m   216.74805114161836
upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him   90.06080557373788
athos smiled   125.37155930836842
louise slid through the half open gate like a snake and bounded lightly forward   224.5113523679245
oh   20.185661240366642
are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison   70.9378544209778
all eyes were fixed on the door and i said beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety   105.64988481096705
and he who changes them will follow friend caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold   248.4474507675055
it appeared to the young man that the guards on seeing him depart chuckled among themselves   141.37033123655678
well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search immediately   77.81585281437256
the unknown chapter 26   118.44446293923896
what are you bringing me   224.18106402850924
albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter   107.08155506969592
franz astonished advanced a step   172.62798647594948
come come that is not bad   176.17713179365848
at the moment caderousse quitted his sentry like watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday   120.24423461494595
how extraordinary   201.02573009411353
yes said porthos   81.75836369361059
we invite him to play to night   174.8447738991175
i address you because you know that although i esteem him from my heart i am a little awed by the comte de la fere   134.1819443059846
on the contrary from a firm conviction   98.72332310164538
what do you think d artagnan   207.98609454160368
valentine and villefort were dumb   47.287553559811556
no upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman i bought it with the contents of my own purse answered he whom they designated by the name porthos   160.32261711908873
but she not only declined to receive the deputies but sent an intimation by chancellor seguier implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of the quarrel paris would be besieged the very next day   70.1392229827497
but make haste i can not stay here all day   146.00537806903807
danglars   71.51982093969875
but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall which causes a tub to turn revealing a staircase must not one speak of that a little my lord   70.09142497016569
in a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to france but the benign aspect of protecting providence   89.32948275273431
edmond dantès   87.77995708472572
but if i had pocketed his pistoles they would have weighed me down like a remorse   19.583688210000346
and both with free use of the spur arrived at st   117.89204695561669
but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use   31.895718218170472
as to d artagnan he sprang toward jussac himself   68.43326602968216
said d artagnan with great pleasure   106.33746770292032
mounted on an excellent horse which he was to leave at the end of twenty leagues in order to take the post planchet set off at a gallop his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the musketeers but otherwise as light hearted as possible   8.313451459988443
indeed   125.83154721489227
meanwhile carried away as we are by our narrative we must leave our three friends to themselves and follow the duke of buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the louvre   78.18677957935617
parbleu   58.854287925403
the anjou wine after the most disheartening news of the king s health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp   179.1250705081425
continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men   205.59007812871278
when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many well known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant   158.0733791296217
question him about the fight said athos   104.64805444906027
he said i prefer waiting till tomorrow   165.19910112274349
d artagnan shook his head and set off at full speed   197.08133350962757
and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league   138.30075972595145
the palikares who were prostrated at my father s feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke   292.416528633399
m   160.08785192936523
said morrel   106.2210502789226
said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully   70.72166719037173
are you fond of traveling   130.1644389245817
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question   120.98366947494226
f   184.0748214853438
i am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force   8.39855633905205
still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels   153.39236623518028
it was mercédès leaning on her son s arm and leaving the house   103.6315405368557
now said planchet let us bind him to a tree   126.37118773289468
the indictment chapter 111   107.21732644449233
more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard   56.8661404535897
d artagnan translated this for the others   137.35519411379943
i am not so proud as you   95.67039586748459
here is monsieur comminges said d artagnan returning to the cardinal   184.47132426664336
thank you monseigneur he said drawing back   155.9682299925096
he told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber   160.33154139937756
beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak   54.975049367229545
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations   107.59892019109394
queen elizabeth and catherine ii   114.75483492721722
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes   194.34092708657323
you will find mine on my saddle already loaded   51.132967493364646
the count then placed his foot on his head saying i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal   113.96629193188355
i learned so much at marseilles replied the abbé making a strong effort to appear indifferent   41.112106677830155
have you no letter for him   235.86483432702897
said the cardinal opening the door   116.79099481429857
ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are   196.389233327219
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses   221.16040480978063
the meeting after mercédès had left monte cristo he fell into profound gloom   26.132360197988703
bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily   164.98369421983548
mademoiselle danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawing room as the spot   205.00032830078555
why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m   112.22461119087394
we are very happy monsieur replied julie   107.81909942224307
well have you any news   42.474787518186204
when i awoke a fresh meal was served   168.83017227038243
i can not help doubting answered danglars with his stupid smile   144.7417726632995
for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night   153.9426932709216
but this first desire of the heart is imperious   144.99424967109053
cried aramis   82.22486610770437
planchet   270.21996856136286
you have been his mistress   194.4449383449114
that is it madame that is the same   71.53531714648258
they were those we rode on   102.2146905196324
and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself grimaud set off at full speed   203.01971827693927
ah a month six months a year   170.11284352426645
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life   144.3901418381747
dantès saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand   22.120541227273122
it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him   120.65046987749048
he was free from the slightest headache   136.7951065992714
it is pleasant isn t it   144.66902013134614
madame replied d artagnan i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do so   159.75566760299347
a letter addressed to monsieur de tréville captain of the musketeers   110.39208076215739
mousqueton was a norman whose pacific name of boniface his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of mousqueton   17.5644692841702
are the half of the sum mother   216.4955713847936
well said the president seeing that charles was determined to remain silent so be it   167.08718329531226
a small vessel with an english crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of charente at fort la pointe   211.00079583519363
monsieur aramis become a poet i beg of you   95.40416825326074
that is the most just remark replied the stranger i ever heard made concerning myself   128.84681993356548
tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although i am only your brother in law i will arrange one similar   74.30484386337164
he exclaimed   137.56913392075433
some to witness the sight others to comment upon it   212.04798885547325
replied he   108.24798556250913
i think i shall feel better there   87.47516811539342
one can always find a tree and a cord   77.34287933120504
but there was no look calculated to reassure her   149.64115862444078
cried porthos   51.13681966385404
at least he believed so   121.09162800324653
their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future   97.86827729710849
beauchamp that you are more sober than he was   146.19356186200022
the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant   134.80820904587938
said the king with hauteur   152.60698703400485
he called   177.08369746495703
silence he said or you are lost   71.86815751167694
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse   136.1823271197812
nothing more moral   113.83511909742441
how much were they worth   78.91291290961448
but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero that the bad opinion entertained by m   147.75940247608554
whatever crimes they may have committed for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of god   178.21028288859782
that is all   32.248426373915706
and he offered a chair to madame danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated   152.05814866228675
the comte de la fere   87.53493887044566
replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back   139.34133549334425
did anyone introduce you to him   242.4978406294726
there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur d arminges and beat a retreat   163.95070190128666
i don t want any supper said caderousse   53.672477529361935
and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs   224.2261312754202
charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn   53.26888084803529
after the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing   172.99116472928267
chapter 17   45.24452506243297
why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study   119.81197352466766
chapter 114   135.27988343411732
the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly   196.14568621753975
motives of hatred against dantès   198.69137499477318
and where is the unfortunate being   56.731012849412444
franz d épinay   143.9808157354918
d artagnan and the englishman chapter xxxi   127.19804511232641
heaven forfend   109.10446243776538
he had good cause to do so   100.93675410777325
28   118.34667940338782
you will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine   98.43477592958203
porthos who could never see anything that was not self evident talked to him as usual   85.33978227332938
young people stop there   46.03818592215583
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter   89.88028329443992
by all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door   109.95806610931037
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw d artagnan who stood expecting her   68.67407576438688
take it and deliver me from your odious presence   197.09550233056294
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds   108.99421190426305
at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto   211.99988052228457
it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on   40.66396225315786
he went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him   44.68123492886893
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart   177.58612500213297
cried the baron   65.12269021341277
at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village curé   131.63804501249103
one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event   83.90985542729322
which means that you now hesitate   84.54302070654104
no sir replied monte cristo   174.96994397484568
precisely so replied gaetano   118.78565953287678
and as betrayed by the mistress of the inn he could not say that aramis was absent he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference which had commenced with the morning and would not as bazin said terminate before night   200.65368408933344
then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure   124.31179473653569
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same   123.34138688051777
the child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said i swear to your majesty   48.80055290210076
said d artagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come   65.59906818415934
the fact is hazarded d artagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis   58.63137579171465
i think he entered the service   227.17798216824337
the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence   133.57000387527154
but on what day will this ball take place   118.719279054785
and secondly how to extinguish the moccoletti of others   95.4310179534669
the ballet of la merlaison on the morrow nothing was talked of in paris but the ball which the aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen and in which their majesties were to dance the famous la merlaison the favorite ballet of the king   1.114356859212137
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green   75.26574103781185
while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia   45.292521252852424
this was the last blow to the prisoner   121.5297234236772
but with regard to yours   199.39250950801627
come he said it is only a veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of cavalcanti   12.116891837438331
he has unfortunately too much wit   157.03132837433242
cried milady trying to drag the young woman along by the arm   66.71907499310743
it was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot but a concerted organized attack   94.6283183647712
and remember that i am waiting for you   120.1292069656235
come let us come to the point   46.9848945636888
have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know   186.2272749407229
while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels   139.29691238359743
ah my friend   259.6714382875917
well do you understand monsieur   191.99455957943115
the host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two friends   63.05892118429642
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dantès   52.22241282602478
but the queen pressed the child s hand   125.05627034054825
oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness   96.23412985562855
for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the father in law of his son   55.10281400196956
sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose   104.40411365653227
trust me madame   5.675553764194149
i will do more than i promise said dantès   189.1906188368822
no it had just struck four   115.63151593663945
he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home   286.53709808980375
there is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church   68.99418568294683
in a moment he was on the ground   10.752084023295055
demanded buckingham   43.97791851248128
you think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers   84.14910183430852
the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic fir trees and myrtles   239.25677800583966
how can you read   148.05803586665363
see him and hear what he says   208.05764629125616
asked d artagnan   223.29600096723055
for the second time i give you your life   148.27973716138487
yes my poor girl replied morrel   112.23399152672782
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port   185.06637980229155
d artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye   236.28118700123406
the first person to attract the attention of dantès as he landed on the canebière was one of the crew belonging to the pharaon   42.039407123146646
alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die   93.0167345374066
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful   118.73662510462056

on the following morning at five o clock d artagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mother s recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor d artagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow   75.92421788509675

this said monte cristo is less correct than your philosophy it is only faith   83.96176953531699
consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul   151.12932371529786
the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux let them be guarded more closely than ever   44.54548827036059
but was it on her own account or on account of another that she exposed herself to such hazards   203.0877492374812
that is acting like a good fellow   69.73810397014424

but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack   134.57454316936122
but how could you have these fish brought to france   19.408360983661566
but will you not go up   137.4682858906032
nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings about   177.43799194448204
for heaven s sake do not speak so loud   168.35608343568074

when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well   205.04229987420814
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak   0.16741149666613353
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetano s description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself   111.15965928882942
if she had been a great lady she would have fainted   170.63351179933102

five hours after that he passed through arras   130.52311771999732
and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the general s anger i advise you not to touch your sword   82.78398883606144
the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man   74.23773653890329
oh heavens   146.66773711434382

so that when you went on board the pharaon everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand   168.55261511351097
cried patrick   67.4941911959764

that will cost you a hundred francs   146.43166570729792
oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness itself   59.28705386628651
but i am ignorant   28.144353566514695
but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me   17.635771746554468
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment   211.49140672422976
he descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in   147.14492554661686

he complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to come deeds and power which none could thwart with impunity   95.78095211220793

the queen had just regained her chamber and d artagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly touched   65.70061172387781

perhaps so   79.51817386912086
i do not wish to be left alone   180.1441179661271
this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count   12.8270479995235

take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris you may be of the greatest service to me at marseilles   143.633674861856

chapter iii   155.17799122484686
morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless   176.0810656050954
ah yes it is true murmured d avrigny   184.44449111599783
but i could find nothing absolutely nothing   114.47241117904868

villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt   250.41691404360623
what can i do   65.92302398678353
exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time   124.69090522411166
murmured d artagnan   109.8928640299104
it is all in beginning   207.4048720101116
i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted   137.7372164023609
and as they were loading the last musket grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready   27.396602514307475
take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so   88.20595177246187

but your father died in your arms happy respected rich and full of years   130.96399353023418
asked morrel with a sickness of heart   159.12797416262683
and you will please to accept the word of monsieur d artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle   91.97336673610103
they then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of m   198.21547067804084
when he arrives i will not fail to do so   117.63460848656798
at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived accompanied by grimaud and eight or ten followers   150.38888540528222
the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent gesture   42.718361976670295
the queen was in the midst of her women mme   103.1175902164786

and he raised his cane six inches higher   154.6962652232976
but if i lose   55.5064827502282
oh   126.40682337158687
ah   274.97486379268094
this silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the clerks   121.67379423941246
now said the baron look at this woman   32.7391430898563
yes   112.21903824304721
laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they haven t left a mouthful and two bottles of macon wine of which they haven t left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders no friend replied raoul smiling i am obliged to you but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have asked only i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good   52.03126579154157

it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formed it was none of these things that attracted the attention it was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdain these were what fixed the attention of all upon him   169.1924426424199
good lord try one throw   79.99740157608463

he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette   138.23366659578818
milady will tell you   108.72999400911254
what do you think of our lover   153.44311488433917
yes his death   34.40910938659833
i am finishing the most execrable morning s work   192.54508217861184
who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say monsieur so and so let us weary ourselves together   143.72458039124047
m   103.98431377239544
do as you please   14.831826725608892
there remained in the banker s house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes   77.16169658388463
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty   106.61738559775989
she had a son observed athos   88.22480982972255
only warn him that it is you   123.47243483507884
bring in the monsieur d artagnan said the commissary to the guards   80.03770885835998
you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body   168.24431338498098
this door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian nights opening at the sesame of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world   76.90270377026417
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you   129.16325828073013
i am not in love with mademoiselle mercédès   121.87278572131854
well here for example said richelieu when in 1610 for a cause similar to that which moves the duke king henry iv   109.86422827055902
be it so said the envoy   75.76945938772916
d artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air   137.98253223687058
go thither and if there be none well well continued louis xviii   86.12197946306578
do you think so   188.20774924307386
you shall be one   238.00502139183385
i have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner   191.8794764386143
de villefort promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the château d if   94.08299229425532
he has grown a good deal it seems to me   42.37989899266647
and how much did they possess   12.700514412913137
now i may hope that god will forgive me since my crime is expiated   14.89106968136636
surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a death   212.00830566450023
if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth   172.1572053637518
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope   72.8708672055143
she lives   145.16188356065535
he cried they must have obtained my arrest   172.8145021791969
a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does   94.4595790991515
his misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance   121.27139636428427
eighteen thousand men and thirty six cannon   157.62722919821408
that is useless   126.33250661116772
do you think so   166.2306458783761
alas   192.21644888566726
you are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me   174.29899208346086
both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance   204.0688198742279
ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then good bye to the pharaon   82.88711198909256
but if you love me as much as you say replied d artagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account   98.89280039496424
50053m the two ladies pressing closely to one another and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating voice repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds   139.24859004750385
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of god s anger   231.85774284495318
and hang me if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from   137.02250309848793
sir said he that man has been here   22.744339748188125
how can you tell me that   191.81302513413885
well asked he of the count what has then happened   73.96798341549612
yes returned aramis   138.67617157825327
i also was married at the death bed of my mother and certainly i have not been less happy on that account   66.16896717076456
said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed   191.41482797782544
grimaud made a sign that he was not   158.95672123426533
i recollect now   70.72926750118383
then said she he has well played his part   52.89243570810578
said the inspector   252.71776139745026
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on end   86.74186524694016
he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life   114.21152038180648
without doubt she murmured   137.56202064633507
well sir exclaimed mazarin what s the matter   35.591440878030795
i waited a month or rather i suffered for a month   158.13916835522488
our conditions said no revenge you will please to recollect   152.43398291839358
what do you mean   95.1717922479232
come hither and let us talk   155.16830209940136
on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him   22.07211370407161
i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known   57.800082097331526
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of chapter xxxv   140.2528443946456
de saint méran related to mademoiselle de villefort   137.15343445575235
no no   234.09455335565798
we had thus at aigues mortes martigues or bouc a dozen places where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom house officers   136.609458561495
the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery   179.93878332302205
villefort fell rather than seated himself   164.03545233862206
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms   31.52195593069422
that can be managed   138.83538201424884
oh my god my god   234.27786372722733
as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together   175.3247192589031
this is the matter gentlemen   184.8667712143568
pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer   175.29267836887016
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted   147.31634739365722
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom house officers   99.05284330954699
but since i tell you cried danglars that with these three million do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million   8.36511433755598
ah pardieu   162.72547088140186
8 or 1   17.924415234588054
we are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of heaven   95.59735928420697
she was very pale   155.8724354487195
continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea   50.080662032892704
if it be not an indelicate question resumed d artagnan have you grown rich   46.34272549029659
how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment d artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris and did not stop till he came to athos s door   113.38911486370613
well   164.01797164304807
when it was seen that danglars sold the spanish funds fell directly   103.75424094274936
nothing was certain   146.7358352315195
the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai d orléans   93.24303455817434
i say that this marriage shall be consummated   129.84788577574628
they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed   103.77819349503862
vainglorious as he was porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least half   169.8034718576999
that s a great story to tell me porthos   66.83199442659914
three quarters of an hour   90.16635581796773
he will consider us as brothers   98.42906777404296
aramis read the letter and passed it to athos   132.04770820771776
i returned last night and here i am   146.00270064304425
i   159.45907646820294
your honor in the library of the chateau of bracieux there are a lot of books of travels   91.11893534175253
he used to be the headsman of bethune   63.047824987777354
d artagnan d artagnan   226.71285206539972
to morrow evening if you like   141.34194664741239
you must advise me what to do   74.72837159192335
and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after albert s departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy   69.0972803871013
toward the town of louvres was the reply   8.461205283899218
my cloak stop up the aperture with it   8.149153186680508
d artagnan remained standing and examined this man   94.52283748485297
if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately   120.64910677586629
six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness   13.851148436459411
and morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal   167.04500611674615
d artagnan who had secured the key shut himself up in the closet without reply   104.17313713679113
the horses are waiting   210.05436060087877
tomorrow by twelve o clock i shall have the order for your exile signed buckingham   55.3963360661588
your hands   182.30539229046255
that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable   137.10085198701563
let us go on straight forwards   208.71827209459457
aramis notwithstanding his self control could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise   88.7150129650964
villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him   20.60522640569215
yes   49.10168820417003
take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever   34.407458384097396
where are you come from sir   163.29500257154
i detest him   41.8207199325162
was it the englishman who carried off 3 000 crowns from here the other day   129.09081596040673
said athos   106.69468037252531
asked athos   45.012502547108326
said porthos as if disgusted   114.84523501291484
my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal   59.43209276060699
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up   334.3056228397695
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time   22.86852101725519
for the rest this vengeance was very easy   91.72602705587187
the valet de chambre will carry your message   162.40546639461178
come beauchamp said château renaud i will bet anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us   165.22878287904848
where is he then   73.64560380421908
de villefort for which i am quite at a loss to account   38.729434159674824
d artagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started   95.24772577445248
said danglars   133.17557795942
edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles   119.84857999750778
oh rely on me said villefort   34.607298389654844
the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and d artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures   100.51664486304986
he will see us if we go out   151.0692122127185
i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de tréville on some pretext or other which you must invent   114.51403443667657
and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted   153.5866029431849
oh heavens exclaimed valentine who was supporting the head of morrel on her shoulder do you not see how pale she is   117.64045596996219
if you do not return how does it concern you   149.75076199231788
you have a charming young person with you tonight count said eugénie   170.08709591581916
they close it   228.5196022696224
and as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded   25.212810991981385
look again chevalier returned lord winter   47.15893624832509
in the name of heaven   178.79650004440253
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct   199.25995948353096
the former sign was repeated   192.3374927646602
i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say   144.07472658188547
he had heard the proverb which mordaunt had given in french   112.06329785084067
to be sure they may   284.0258529039058
i was at the end of my journey and of my credit   154.5733652720477
you are very generous gentlemen of the guards said athos full of rancor for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day   186.40357519588824
but this year continued the horticulturist i ll take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe   104.69264517117303
said albert   126.67862632296733
it will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the neck   149.1348195411661
ah i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart   139.73529726113827
read this letter he said handing it to her   148.91823247671607
de tréville   140.50159212960287
were they alone   143.34557666562276
the four millions i promise you will produce ten or twelve   146.75643437237227
never mind   82.10970392168024
de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared   104.88496934352267
the king feared an outbreak   43.0635670166628
why did you talk of a regiment athos   156.7124250810768
chapter li   107.66965569569925
de monte cristo saved your life   84.89920716117882
asmodeus that diabolical personage who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece would have enjoyed a singular spectacle if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saint germain des prés while debray was casting up his figures   158.73943416471388
sir my father is a man of great foresight and prudence   140.63876636183141
don t trouble yourself to reveal your good luck   14.340747292361783
halloo   103.54111462110326
but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness   176.30876723150593
the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and saint méran coffins   103.13009342364086
and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations   170.05873832671756
two or three hundred roman crowns   25.842701461444634
cried broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority   105.13014623821168
30055m it is true said valentine as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks and permitted maximilian to press his lips to them and you are a true and faithful friend   160.30279348576295
are they in danger of dying   90.29944882955358
milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony   187.74674427020858
one of them was a foreigner english i think   142.03619899182
30251m then you do not speculate   157.3325020588748
cried the two musketeers in a breath   163.74483451930942
ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of england   198.7631070005589
athos turned around with an effort   194.02849047598613
milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave felton an immediate and terrible proof of her courage   19.175171582981008
the major passed his hand across his brow   132.5979544759936
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets   97.877550918217
do you know she is going to embrace a religious life   146.85136864507237
the man was caderousse he was pale and his shirt was all bloody   3.0509646406281234
come in m   61.040986415560674
oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my father s mind is really impaired said villefort   201.73392626243256
the cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of september   115.13718639771103
exceedingly replied franz   90.51530539840934
listen   132.31812216139429
hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms   220.54328628913882
certainly not   62.92473815392829
porthos is wounded then   123.54616894658217
this petition to napoleon kept back by villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king s attorney   31.393813504347648
who could have said so the evening before   29.949322781295862
but don t let us hinder you mousqueton   126.0822731409026
benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool   216.23476444259035
it is for you or me   105.79803674592276
asked athos   52.53548861961866
so that when the illustrious companion of the great henry died the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto   232.48699066662505
i am going to the queen   63.51000049273636
that is why m   147.88905101412317
in my trunks   163.53904370342283
when daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream   127.67064730665138
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution   75.45035344116407
which is my best cavalry horse   105.29700515141306
wait a little aramis   53.06892098445995
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned musketeer named athos has taken her safe conduct from her by force   26.194062775816846
the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner   124.9992251546792
now will you return with me   99.37042245968712
franz fell powerless on a chair   148.76938567144703
get them at borel s and be sure you say they are for me   191.66168453676391
i know something of diamonds   121.75839411922782

yes   4.357848084462617
asked the queen almost timidly   23.894896067219094
monsieur baptistin especially   59.91034301162288
but no his heart is beating   33.79674782981161
nothing i should like better   136.52918507108208
40032m forgive me sir said franz in a resolute tone   180.44838322734893
said valentine   108.86581938061356
asked rochefort   166.97258274671847
i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her   179.3693122844674
dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently   181.46570168682
hold sir said villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene   111.11021530333205
i ll tell you answered the countess   285.7674535830299
a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures   87.13486113248612
silence was re established   137.1112846458791
it was the end of november all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet   100.96012352464568
he offered his arm to the countess   76.3260057871392
i am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again   161.71173226221322
athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes   256.16892284794244
for the persons of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me i should break to pieces like glass   74.96342045868823
the idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes   79.62586907178442
sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister   93.11374686581723
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family   158.4346337658767
said blaisois pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table   126.1926666560702
i will break every bone in your body   60.63533050889196
the monk   3.3080881181449797
he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading   161.60998195812147
and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me   145.1593612890795
no   246.0833855615698
have you anything   82.51827456253841
here s a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond   206.59476613032643
he went into her room and has not been downstairs since   129.91636301600622
in paris   108.49986044170134
england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise   92.51568602763203
i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition   64.62844421577245
so my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me   215.81767748107183
remember that i never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived   89.62854391836218
cried d artagnan   185.9829769728978
at the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself   136.55336053390096
if he says true said the captain doubtingly   19.80079679102161
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m   52.23354189968633
then said felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish followed   55.35577364955029
he the all powerful he before whom others were accustomed to fly he who had taken for his device they hate me   148.8451075796051
that is because we are talking spanish my dear friend said athos   47.61046155230423
you have not returned that visit and you were wrong   86.32985992796188
before daybreak m   167.03838051314574
he questioned me concerning captain leclere s death   83.0688290308106
and during that year another skilfully placed 1 000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison   109.34922433408775
what is the matter madame   125.05322581347791
look here   70.94608587287686
aha   109.12302527454328
listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong   137.95911343043335
grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set off   185.37016874726743
no signature   85.71912784185916
it would be just the same today no doubt for since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a doctor   108.16209305649654
you thoroughly understand me sir   52.149080121930126
that s true murmured the commissary   32.511106713222446
she asked in great distress   11.673289982355286
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy   53.39173930448713
exclaimed morrel i do not deceive myself that young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is albert de morcerf   159.24001207173245
of me   131.34565344045083
at four o clock as we have already stated the mysterious personage arrived   97.95543885647449
rich   140.39954744317257
nonsense   91.5032535774923
bonacieux dead and d artagnan in a swoon   183.8363324710984
your excellency may depend upon me   96.88529105309681
i had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts   141.67304554497912
he rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of mordaunt   101.77083923228402
asked buckingham as he opened the letter   37.4506136433081
indeed i do not know what he is   170.08534178661094
you wish to remain alone with m   74.70462857227996
which you refused   60.21256990725921
that would be useless   53.10993276649059
well sire the usurper left elba on the 26th february and landed on the 1st of march   141.0297742198846
i questioned her but in vain   164.22833623035226
but as lord wilmore in the character of the count s enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous   34.08559695121414
just then the sound of finger nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed valentine that the count was still watching and recommended her to do the same   193.3518989221911
we traversed greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates   114.19219179411277
dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was mistaken   69.61142664811115
that s my great disadvantage   71.01873145175121
m   138.44211201251375
i remember just at his age how deep in love i was with a grecian statue which our good king then henry iv   205.8451989047063
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever   37.1617725462976
involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes a well known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped   148.39005427309533
come now you don t really wish it   206.88895593093187
but i think that god has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night i see that woman s ghost rising before me   24.959765341526193
it is waiting for us at greenwich opposite the isle of dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights   189.64466210169334
for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman   184.04367753369976
it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear   144.31989012206247
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force   144.23678151195378
doctor pray recall your words   94.38806148217502
his house has been full ever since   156.60494252281433
on the contrary i do   160.72185938799237
said athos that s a proposition that pleases me   33.01731851996655
but at the very moment when d artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it m   94.91206597214017
oliva corsinari was it not   183.71081358772147
so that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all   104.4478729266069
i have nothing more to do with them nor they with me   67.84277039915838
she did not please   39.70960572372499
come parry said the king cease your tears   76.09705473067235
what more do you want   87.35666886114782
he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis   111.30082808101932
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn   104.90127103153391
my leave is at an end   89.69628258844763
by heaven   87.49973825098994
but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening   211.12916222287316
keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me   97.7344432787684
monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time pistache s patience was exhausted   185.43596173103572
the roll call continued   234.325209359266
but shutters   150.63170835467125
what do you say   249.8285741783534
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage   211.55018292047657
what musketeers are now within the palace   196.52547302995757
i shall kill him i can not help it   132.12069356738934
felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the door   173.3755526370909
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke   63.56037990352972
and who thus advised you   55.466215175735684
then porthos and aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to grimaud   61.17928124682515
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her   71.96370492342406
he is thinking of groslow   146.7835002406449
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags   102.05345585198161
according to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we can not account   135.43480266215187
mordaunt went away with the captain   90.93646932062664
sire i fear it is more than a plot   117.81805893320583
then why did you think of giving your daughter to him   111.16538548794874
he remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light   71.3816059813
exclaimed gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure   44.294639047464386
if he land in france it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population   127.66649855298088
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you   130.36180342320762
if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave   43.85450766590543
i am prepared for anything   109.96696401446295
he was an annoyance to the cardinal   134.85590536558615
when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously   107.64882626642621
begone then   140.50293770408868
i know nothing   149.03282435680964
i was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner   229.3151346967208
on approaching the hotel of the roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected   80.16565523060733
hold your tongue   54.50938036850474
i am aware of that and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong   31.456421696747483
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st   93.41303593460496

the king went out accompanied by the chevalier de coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own apartment   124.24962992616382

here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town   96.36833869672563
danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught   220.8040203190903
perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle   176.2257205243408
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier   52.897798033992345
how were you to blame in that affair   9.607130626657948
and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate   173.93216494658074
let us alight here said athos   174.39631243441548
well   8.221230261615688
0029m right dantès quite right   141.0886880215046
and yet their natural disposition revealed itself   75.28570975464079
i am not forgotten   97.69749490453611
cried athos   121.19822895480874
fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory   28.540405082597232
your age   214.53530758447278
tell me is this the moment for a wedding   127.48777157697634

monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance   217.0035962367229
both at the palais royal   113.61473317527208

to seek me   170.59437937935388

cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force   109.83665252255989
then what   134.63951023584193
this is all very well murmured the king yes this is just the account the duke gave me of the affair   123.91896153345162
chapter lii   60.583265357022746
you who know his life and his crime   117.63066883677223
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look   146.62977904064
bring the prisoner in again said the cardinal   173.08543444836823
still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer   135.8667684126291
it may be judged whether d artagnan looked or listened with avidity   112.86882080264628
if his eminence said he did not have personal motives the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him pardon me said he   66.60488497689933

said the swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the german language had acquired a habit of swearing in french   178.0853246275086

coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st   71.3049470946383
her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect   157.77888424907826
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal s baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemy s line of battle at fribourg   141.45229299709962
do you know him   14.814451860412134

a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a man   94.60791729523473
a war of partisans unworthy of a king   106.72606104674345

the three musketeers passed behind his eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions   230.5776628779152
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit   265.3489233097604

can you not tell me his name   183.95683288389225
two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard   107.04750763332726
i shall always love you   188.96573500750213
oh   101.19436717002988
felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger   117.83548264710637
we burn as they say at the game of pincette   159.49584665085612
i wait till i am confided in and apart from that which lord de winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to me   52.88366601400227
chapter lviii   166.56866650459745
nor did they terminate at any grotto   114.75634262657468
emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard the well known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived   135.88422975652176
like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable   278.8684302629018
i pardon you monseigneur   123.45229912411186
but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes   110.04666768843269
two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared   34.025212865725734
man of ability as he was louis xviii   62.87646192251575
the door was instantly opened and shut   179.7074391488949
that you are to be at no   92.53234914861729
but it is understood that what i offer you i offer him at the same time   78.70828539670788
noirtier s apartment   57.902537182047595
andrea seized the certificate of his father s marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents   238.317304240145
de tréville who had a tincture of literature and monsieur de benserade was quoting it to me the other day   61.32307198527204
d artagnan added m   171.65277308326986
gimblou a glass of wine   105.78676931125963
merri was announced   12.473288943156689
that is true   87.05182467927006
if this ship founders like the others he is a ruined man   98.35689138458591
is there nobody from whose house monsieur laporte can come and fetch you   174.37921603391936
i make you my lieutenant general said the king   140.4124249118325
good day commander   26.962807636895064
were i compelled to marry another i would destroy myself   95.63612103814764
de tréville launched it with knowledge of his cause   71.29714640941526
it is natural enough   49.90188072146884
what sort of person is he   166.11545256923475
woman is fickle   120.46594311920033
the messenger resisted   82.02278095101941
inquired cromwell   186.07486283572473
no   67.07876866580958
that is my condemnation thought d artagnan   100.63801466123776
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long   169.0789359048143
necessity has no law   170.68587351680975
thought d artagnan   56.4530085802992
replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical   112.61732209626808
but when bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to heaven and walking in all humility the very last d artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe   80.25318768223828
but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary and i no longer have them   20.475286352180362
is that she mamma   65.38475365077484
i have what is still better   113.53417635178954
you cursed host   163.57213739521615
from the time of his arrival in paris he had been mixed up with public affairs   179.1131364430012
you were not so timid once   60.9344602034876
why i expect to be made marechal of france   68.52200736415577
he calls himself so   20.754027320059535
the chemist who came here with me   123.72878221504145
madame danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing villefort s hands exclaimed my child was alive   155.08409098225977
monsieur d artagnan will enjoy our conversation better   50.58461922267202
inquired aramis   91.79805263244424
sign my lord   118.40395811429609
which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned d artagnan   172.56140131160345
permit you   12.24072783379313
why people jest with death   164.76170161664055
now sir i am listening go on   33.295209106780504
six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was   100.10740343164808
asked the queen of lord de winter   99.07581455927311
i have not handled a card or dice box   124.80059783222931
on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger   124.41973806191997
he is there   155.29476411403868
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not move   113.8731728209601
nor hang me   110.13481551199715
our dear count   89.5648407125075
this lackey was my compatriot   29.503326116894613
have you not slept   89.24650079566318
and what makes me all the more wretched sir is that i was the cause of this misfortune   119.20032060697449
porthos shrugged his shoulders   17.814449092800103
what is that again   143.10092566667876
as for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him   114.72994404122655
he thought of his wife   116.38538505329078
fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a word   118.02303163976252
it was precisely similar to his sister s apartments except that for the breakfast parlor he had a billiard room where he received his friends   113.44704656106758
said porthos opening his large eyes   60.44098168014521
perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them   213.2306234573553
porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing   176.6319439418023
ah traitor cried buckingham you have killed me   146.5836295986932
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door   223.5202203479255
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced   67.66347807760303
and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them   34.22076971670015
certainly   110.57941790704021
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power   48.769160124078425
peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming   101.28205444246747
but i do not wish anyone to stay with me   87.77004388813275
asked debray   59.52297814750612
i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said morcerf   68.71375013913658
perhaps i shall stand in need of a back door for retreat   63.39035118911886
with this consoling idea i leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you   32.61465937040326
the day passed thus   84.58400335839697
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it   196.89202032483092
but if you stir you are dead men   5.540152607996845
you are right morrel   161.70406326767568
d artagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friend s house shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni   43.38914155022337
still i hesitated to wake him although i fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual   21.753714570199733
yes   38.94709230796293
but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself   206.43393161394283
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing   85.63920459472521
oh what an abyss   196.65548010901244
a dumb and frozen carcass in fact living painlessly on that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay   177.46718812399752
as soon as the identity of my brother was proved i was set at liberty   94.50973870848564
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias   108.41105785437333
i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses   49.58653409588946
halloo   57.64067020731219
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that   200.9525527476922
hey yes thank god i am pretty well said mousqueton   19.065127030710144
and let us drink   84.77944583791941
but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted   145.7423197134749
morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard   57.67460649613756
come speak   22.475260285974542
i live because it is not ordained for me to die   48.46481231599262
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited d artagnan to drink   79.9961111964829
soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them then at last the volcano was extinguished then all was dark and still the floating bark and heaving ocean   158.8383812622514
this time you will lay your plans more accurately   58.356016296102695
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning   69.7181266116708
fasten it to the poop with a rope   150.420566923624
yes   151.05886741223884
it was therefore near seven o clock   248.35296509950845
danglars kept up the title of prince   115.27107369066438
toward midnight charles heard a great noise beneath his window   95.75056446463148
albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friend s conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the count s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess   116.82556096890578
30349m m   109.08169262914656
valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation   138.1023266342615
talking of that said debray madame was making inquiries about that house which for the last three months has been hung with black   82.93814178757373
you are sure it is not he   192.68305642130412
and i said the marshal what am i to do   26.52827552299817
let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you   94.45286885966442
he kept his word   179.41806226893138
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene   129.74951116026824
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly   124.77524110340813
kitty will conduct you to my chamber   116.85357129656171
today   61.60000684792501
i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone   130.5303321196032
badly monsieur badly   126.87763180463263
how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpent like forehead round vulture shaped head and sharp hooked nose like the beak of a buzzard   94.81168680676289
and i too said porthos   90.95669954950972
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin   39.77978152848944
speak on said aramis   47.55819436775792
forward   136.27408572342384
go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come   68.55228809056203
god forbid   174.81282629179336
well that s something for i have not the shadow of one said athos coolly   169.70299954651452
yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced   124.13558663637608
during the examination of milady by the officer as may well be imagined milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances   30.49086716238979
planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says in that case things look ill   158.32023496044312
no no continued danglars   113.21626733448637
entirely   0.7712506571305369
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat   166.07024192943175
but he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the duke s hôtel   35.36202178411766
the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left   28.121374014188405
the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimaud s hands but grimaud shook his head   107.15133787873202
barrois   37.334624384730745
what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die   109.89366124995288
nay said danglars it is my fault   131.00807655838824
cried porthos   101.91009206572801
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and one nights   157.17496084683492
m   254.71876966630143
where is that   127.94229092084078
o reilly said the duke leading him into the chapel look at these diamond studs and tell me what they are worth apiece   146.04363533341973
but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice   54.93078111305098
bread and salt chapter 72   88.22588690356173
repeat it to me   119.791030247731
is he at home   207.51844875383807
with what view   3.749506172779661
this is not the way that i wished to avenge myself said milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith   132.4971664386842
forgotten he   111.06422128499737
b   168.48982540538148
anne of austria opened the door to him herself   154.74342280535808
danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed it   239.08673865621697
debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie   127.73061969427589
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource   45.435661607431186
suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead   83.30053275430276
he thus addressed d artagnan your resistance is useless   181.35705805170514
for three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice   169.94288695505577
i shall benefit by your advice this very evening   66.61223677949675
my fist is strong enough i swear cried porthos extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton   60.239831590687906
without doubt he recognized d artagnan for he became deadly pale   58.71738802736834
yes   140.24303574263672
but first of all how are madeleine and antoinette   204.53408871298265
provided charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must thank   138.87234939111073
just now i told you it was of m   82.85999358397666
what fortune has she   100.01119216186021
d artagnan was the first to recover from his surprise   127.83290150412265
the moon lighted the group   142.81361982647084
de tréville captain of the king s musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis   83.28575094970333
no you are a physician   121.88254195949003
said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door   159.99610314874042
my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens   190.39170750414505
because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the baroness   166.7277388449291
but your honor will soon be called so generally   70.50721941653661
i wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person   212.44441744800253
fernand understood nothing except that dantès was absent   65.21586471175976
but who told you i was inactive   167.34972520614204
m   171.25041752388626
there was a secret communication between the cardinal s apartments and those of the queen   161.47923528578355
i will answer you   13.83107238216516
the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her journey   77.84234182327754
the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the château d if   175.94963660126814
porthos men like us can t go out from here purely and simply   55.587348421246304
speak speak   198.19865779421508
in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds   156.75222134823923
why he would be annoyed if i did not play with him   248.608811907576
come come said albert do not assume so much indifference   156.50008307051456
i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene   80.70954105496929
some spy of the cardinal said de winter to him aside   121.61403372933987
they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads lowered   8.863839791799094
i have had the honor of informing your eminence that these men were drunk   143.3764202326759
but to return to our duchess   23.820001946416568
though you lose sight hearing consciousness fear nothing   203.42330249834822
de villefort in this simple way madame replied monte cristo   200.0434843684397
are you hungry   84.67319702941802
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white bellied black clawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him   53.66589270304843
the brand of england   99.44014443407619
gentlemen said jussac it is with great regret that i pronounce the thing impossible   143.97476099156302
i did not like to go to him without first seeing you   35.74128161831548
everything is possible in this affair even a miracle   224.33857818875305
by r lady   37.29912251828058
for you know athos   174.34224552823906
without revealing himself   98.38862359667544
you are placed on high my lord but tremble   143.40047095822152
well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor   129.72506508078507
and with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example   109.36549797376512
yes   165.70622109919623
what is it   178.25408190849177
for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house   176.49698822804567
serpent muttered d artagnan i would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name   75.2300703462713
here we are   108.69022458930277
but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man   84.10649485357256
but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain   120.68462636512223
at least keep him there till my daughter be married   83.2288983656731
you know my theory regarding duels   113.2241444425267
as i told you my dear morrel m   288.5418084772622
meant   25.920144944113545
at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes and porthos started   79.58667998137199
the austere puritan lies   169.22128669652304
afraid of being heard   44.04606985538305
asked she   151.12925952497963
the cardinal s refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence   130.73069635727512
i   123.03777478286473
it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that i must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me   43.246966697703414
not if it were my own brother   5.41217307757276
during the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried noirtier from valentine s room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child   82.81564598610225
maximilian who was paying them a visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of apathy   121.71081275732976
dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering   150.35212042498554
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause   99.83003169950882
he passes for a very charitable man   31.182724041745402
three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church   17.333540370121796
however i scold you instead of him and in his place   35.539376802446895
he has received visits from the coadjutor from madame de longueville and the prince de conti   141.14568509896853
tonight after twelve i will come and see you and you shall convince me   69.92183792258598
no for porthos will pay you   130.14888572356853
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another   151.15971925343328
the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said d avrigny and i will maintain this assertion before god and man   176.80765564174925
this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed   162.1600813283711
the boat replied   189.43845396301435
whispered aramis to athos did you see   47.92995432079948
i do not know   127.64061250001834
george villiers duke of buckingham mme   113.89155707173074
now what would you say to an ensign s commission in my guards and a company after the campaign   41.43459785221374
m   2.9050147748452844
count said morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth   36.118543896812724
capital   225.75338304684436
i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner   84.88545610891455
and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor   16.18564560019921
besides it does not seem very dangerous   128.690134091974
she will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies   43.58564055363223
but perhaps you have been wrong   170.16036888772206
i have long wished it   250.32801110069803
d artagnan   182.49574704153446
like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed   180.92250909935075
d artagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans   35.182569865829464
asked the baroness   31.032601007936066
and what are they to live upon   141.4123470355692
danglars was there also you recollect m   27.482665448660853
exclaimed the man with gray hair   114.37994641606703
but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue   107.84274484007695
and the ridicule will fall on me   77.00612818808287
the king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his hands   49.37323941590634
the queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted   139.43555925682483
i owe you my real good my present happiness   153.87066507264373
no no never   81.39740375993088
stolen   157.2847953115869
continued he addressing raoul   85.9559231677872
we on our side do the same   104.14163941990384
you believed that i would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch   75.24075080176475
everyone offered his own   238.30171630994232
madame de villefort sighed   80.1717196016952
the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother   112.82283793030366
that is why i have uttered the words for which you blame me   72.21975583673375
laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet   115.5672300892835
however he continued all the same but with increasing warmth yes i can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise   183.72621714572455
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he   69.31485549155364
thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands   232.1761390226075
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive   55.988164238496765
to caderousse s great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the count s breast flew back blunted   96.68551072476184
yes buckingham   68.41305314117031
in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address madame danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely extravagance   112.68882778307706
cried athos extending his hand to the lieutenant   145.0323947168644
there said the young man handing kitty the letter sealed   184.12270047575748
only added he with a smile i warn you i know very little   251.09950998293328
it was mordaunt   196.9676534172409
said villefort   39.93255111812255
go gentlemen he said   193.93671188509825
i won t have dantès killed i won t   159.6731432737994
cried albert   226.3113755342342
then ringing the bell once look   263.70214666880315
and that was too much far too much murmured villefort   154.50323621661676
i have not seen you nor your friends and i don t think you could gather all that dust that i saw planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris   122.17397370216368
were you crazy rochefort   72.24932141604856
but strongly recommends m   139.76813003291167
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercédès and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to her be assured my dear daughter he is dead   93.12582882464139
easily said monte cristo   96.12521738345161
five thousand francs per month   244.14417456626083
it was the same through which twenty four years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard   190.94867716231016
everything was in the same state   93.27102986655845
you said so yourself   213.39259596498727
said mordaunt with a terrible smile   1.873254883086446
but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust   79.06961280642247
my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand   190.54844988311356
i repeat it is melancholy to pass one s life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope   89.66626259393493
after the battle of navarino when the greek government was consolidated he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district which was given him   41.04009912760182
richelieu the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie   105.19122943196267
hum   112.87263811573885
i do not see him   112.60952380719417
after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris   191.31900574643092
de tréville a thing which considering the habitual reticence of the worthy musketeer had very much astonished his captain   204.48594046769452
listen   15.78622609735261
allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment   206.14403824180314
i am sure he hasn t yet arrived   135.71183492396707
unless i am mistaken it has been already written   160.19008551288238
bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions   95.11245370580079
well monseigneur replied the latter three musketeers and a guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion st   224.93536628639822
she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched   37.75719693088071
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong   191.63980276642823
because he left no commentaries replied la ramee with his coarse laugh   42.24852806778293
you alarm me cried franz   84.42460140527052
as we have before said the post chaise was waiting   129.02404508629232
did you see it all   25.48750211006876
listen to monsieur de tréville said the king   101.3850116531898
absurd   91.6817767109698
besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself   183.94235324078826
him   179.4171068966579
i once she said despised the love of a cardinal who never said i shall do but i have done so and so   43.078406689114644
it is possible said morcerf   132.15444750900411
then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentine s sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest   114.12087556690466
he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as i have heard him say   148.7894426901977
a letter from the viscount   172.1457620457303
colonel tomlison said charles kings can not yield   162.94247771710604
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne   112.00828311953012
pardon monsieur   55.65719605615812
if his mistress abandons him he will find friends i will answer for it   87.23058064815503
he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul   80.96541021122012
singular bandits   76.55448386699348
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her   47.622852689242094
what for   86.14517587778008
replied the count   67.30847939942205
and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle which was determined he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war   168.97187637567416
well be it so let us not dispute about words   105.1419356742811
now it is that i regret d artagnan   64.8311282814134
oh go on monsieur go on   97.22056024270927
de tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon   153.74987886302267
milady reseated herself foaming   242.258250871796
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time   31.96863732475414
who knows   126.30550472570117
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light   88.62910074485583
said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment i understand english then   125.9162444258012
a sailor   84.29326044842826
he was in ecstasies   152.78762813123768
why how came you to be so well acquainted with all this   69.27887777765466
indeed i do   142.49107069797284
that will look very well   101.66083960105901
milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes   129.4318757591914
secondly i learned it from beauchamp s journal   129.41667432443978
angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to be   30.695787143038046
devoted men are so rare tréville by the back staircase   88.64287333358196
do you promise   143.7702888810884
cried d artagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and frozen   164.04957405328733
we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner   18.38580602377877
marvelous   254.76620964485204
the gate once closed and debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked what was the matter with you hermine   93.0887917407943
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back   271.8471422143557
and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally   42.906827631371584
so there is no chance of my escaping   118.00420674063999
nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you want   116.4595050153679
said athos useless   176.61354182505426
well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i   134.27371603010994
you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out   66.02352527526038
whereupon grimaud observing the duke s disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him   182.48402751457968
but we all have our faults   182.35998571350166
cried milady   107.90369917822801
the monk s eyes glittered   169.51633605671324
the beggar shook his head   163.8565362989259
selim repeated from time to time the sacred words god is great   148.55163487523063
silence then   147.213598160708
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know d artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul   93.46591017023991
what ho   76.554566081215
returned penelon   165.01723223887606
do you think you can behead me with a single blow   157.82953464931774
i know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore i in my turn will be serviceable to you   119.83767097760276
faithless court   31.022127667813947
i was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating heart   150.90600547785473
that who was here   205.7947148354383
whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned albert   144.3639337416322
i should think so indeed   80.56059600544143
all at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden suspicion   173.09615848694702
the halberds were for the audience in the rear   75.84284684670835
d avrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman   209.4849772981184
i know nothing for certain   146.54612195562208
cried the host   137.43423983069124
when they spoke although teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier as luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good looking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination   163.8689193586968
asked he by a gesture   207.159716076221
and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden   22.377264847664748
good day to you   134.19597737138469
my poor friend i had forgotten you were in love   78.30857046995015
he exclaimed i begin to be more at my ease however whilst you settle yourselves i shall make the round of the boat   82.32029027870314
i can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river   34.635709406145565
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach   70.01525480055768
come come   183.63247686852714
yes gentlemen in the king s room   51.960790857451
during dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage   155.2142684468921
yes   129.5837720120756
yes said monte cristo i have heard that   174.95886969897307
dame nanette look for those apricots which madame de longueville sent to us yesterday from noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new bread   116.80569525195534
athos as a diplomatist   133.54702987666278
he is coming to play with us this evening   166.22086375182894
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship   131.4544892797803
the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port hole   143.82726717783424
have you answered the question i put to you on entering the room   114.60426049394415
well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you   88.49833636147584
does that alarm you   122.92506932781659
consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret   29.385448841457674
and i sire said m   167.98415759434238
now am i at liberty to retire   100.76776139543438
but wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet   61.12708048698764
it is too gracious   78.97737503655327
what do you say to this du vallon   152.4016248394048
without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken   148.56578312631515
everything depends on you   40.91093493854744
i desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage   196.13520097894704
it is a spanish wine which our friend athos thought much of   182.2596370702762
unhesitatingly repeated debray   173.22087674508555
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits   126.61961654771041
replied tréville haughtily   99.8557575744023
it is you who have come to me   222.02593755583493
he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller   111.99079441189132
porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream   131.80188136982972
from whom   53.29255749066649
charles smiled   107.2556164219406
no she is a bordeaux vessel la gironde   67.28266108698196
and if you grant me the care of your future prospects you will redouble my strength   68.42723327293493
my friend said athos he has given me news of raoul   251.95704205566557
said athos musingly   145.8604242296372
planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon   184.68207531433427
and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed   132.7154257051893
for a mind so perspicuous as that of d artagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future   19.688574880087813
instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another   61.28701463114471
the abbé with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him half full swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale cheeks   119.3907757962479
will there be any mass   117.86370324376928
albert understood his thoughts   157.36875404324454
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities   214.2095216588144
admirable   192.0565763087807
indeed   158.92005892049684
during the ligue about which guitant was speaking just now the people chanted nothing except the mass so everything went to destruction   213.2552025679543
50083m what is the matter   123.41286109751685
le blanc was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace   14.844616442011358
yes   152.28274660223474
i grant it monsieur replied madame de chevreuse with her most gracious smile   57.31669736312128
au revoir not farewell   121.26183433662322
the royal procession set out for paris   100.1809696011363
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them   85.19133650524074
that is very simple   114.25068835407171
through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park   79.90375793764359
once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction   176.93090401299406
go to your chamber said she to mme   115.73910485796516
monte cristo rang   119.34415822345774
do you give it to me   125.82067792615452
the eyes of noirtier glistened and d avrigny approached   107.6958085310085
m   238.67854510470562
very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day   151.73003316424035
he said i am then to die   194.02803131123477
stay said beauchamp surely i am not deceived   119.57305511330479
it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here   114.68315944838518
let us call one of these lackeys with a demi pistole in the left hand   103.36119206261652
the carriage stopped   69.90029727139301
until that time continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us   144.93826127191844
in the meantime follow me   28.37919029918436
he is very young   108.15373257925003
but the glass cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies   315.1313487116961
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes   109.67907843756016
but his quickness was not of much use to him   126.81966517463803
but doctor you see me already so grieved how can i introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow   95.7028246544774
answered danglars   91.39523500951324
at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir   89.09618831453227
go to the stable   67.23708636724007
the count soon heard andrea s voice singing a corsican song accompanied by the piano   77.28329891580182
not at all said athos calmly   75.77153503080119
she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped   116.24731407347957
speak said charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him   75.68843861030567
demanded the count   115.06247021677108
it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart   246.93000549916624
he followed where they led him   217.21572921332498
gentlemen   63.82237506640739
never mind that said barrois   116.27202791293445
i have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest   28.821930853349485
nearly   194.957661333159

chapter xxxvii   110.36121646966585
three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away   57.6778771025608
the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck friends taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other some weeping others noisy in their grief the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of maximilian from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay   146.25132951840317
he then called for his horses drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget   146.0192189839527
stammered the unhappy woman completely overwhelmed   107.45234975140295
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter   40.94828622814947
once sir when i was grafting a rose tree   78.16705486401248
no you are right and i should say that would bring him ill luck   82.3255522131212
the count   45.93201297838435
i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars i can not understand how any man can really love her   44.15098049024846
his second the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villefort s life   78.23583808425595
we bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a half   137.7612153370844
ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball   197.3706642445457
the procurator s wife smiled thinking that it was for her porthos had put himself to this trouble   137.0901654977997
i kiss your hands   104.16153451715067
cried the cardinal looking at the clock   52.192833105525324
it is nevertheless the truth monsieur the pure truth the truth of the good god   190.03918320103742
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things   297.00502830708217
asked d artagnan drawing more pistoles from his pocket   150.17621114936316
but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme   193.65686004166332
this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style said the messenger carelessly   67.37486347983605
let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal and how he likes   156.8042312136534
ah   139.0630837050955
the night was quiet enough   170.29188695718727
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow   240.53907502429217
the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france   226.55435033549276
you do not know how much i require this assurance   146.8636021255906
did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to brussels for the queen   39.05286743123658
m   103.13029492942722
you remember what a beautiful night it was   139.54857538774047
my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me   97.20699674678963
strange   136.13831135849864
chapter xlii   126.53007353634914
i will even venture to say that i am certain m   28.762412366343824
and then he added in a low voice tell your master that his eminence is very well disposed toward him and that his fortune perhaps depends upon this interview   127.28675493141793
answer me   102.39876882167813
how many people thought he and not one true friend   162.2283324393464
we two are worth a dozen   157.21142356002633
what do you say   53.5510820100484
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock   234.75499392708957
ah ah   101.85486545259135
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier   28.89499779671614
do not fatigue yourself with speaking   124.47006398687039
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility   62.38814652883504
listen   111.45315573725168
to me   9.504746612022075
he exclaimed   117.97614490630949
pledge it then   28.26271665341102
said mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men   108.661525824733
and what on earth are you going to do with it   207.07937874111184
because madame de saint méran is just arrived in paris bringing the news of m   140.21774890014586
it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight   87.35727909738694
let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses   66.55408889434888
those are indeed holidays to me   94.78352450133931
they breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all   57.7234232160145
for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton   62.20291776806372
the balance would come to about that sum   134.96618002628236
de sévigné   58.03288697303585
not so mademoiselle eugénie danglars   81.41964223630424
and behind the surgeon the door closed   100.51433599059759
the expression of the count s face had not remained unperceived by the banker   58.114730624791946
fie   93.4465021406925
you wished it to be preceded by all these titles   176.66505277070945
then the noble and severe countenance of athos crossed his mind   152.3555718785149
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him   155.28441227604642
mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne horse small but very handsome   154.5462642975338
chapter lxxix   53.35340197884287
the strangers were indeed no other than the count and haydée   19.73373768124594
the valet entered   156.28774047850283
said bonacieux hesitating to take the purse fearing doubtless that this pretended gift was but a pleasantry   85.27489703343187
you must not leave me   41.78764568999328
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover   98.33729647342798
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues   164.4143193037282
it appears sir that this edmond dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another   25.489640874364326
we want said athos charlotte backson who first was called comtesse de la fère and afterwards milady de winter baroness of sheffield   71.3873805847919
cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy   140.9483224627038
this instant sir this instant i beseech you   72.58887923613975
the more she has forgotten the high position in which she was placed the more degrading is her fall   163.65907222208847
now that i see you young and with a promising future now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth   115.69719610740779
well well don t be angry my boy   124.54904001222667
debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes   156.13475514644836
that is the very truth cried the mercer   78.6932090009403
yes   116.53898566361596
but fortunately there are dungeons here   74.81145659196514
so it was with monsieur d artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel   127.01476486651423
then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports   49.44347768821129
no matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulity and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you how often have i myself ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine   41.15784586056833
what should you do in my place   33.74906294405142
and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness   126.9712856992865
said monte cristo   158.2627275298567
on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet   193.85984806739668
yes certainly   125.68041716483222
bonacieux   30.58986050522799
this was more than poor bonacieux could endure depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced   8.838499797338002
i reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust   154.22696706754493
monsieur said louis xviii   105.8718799217105
why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair   90.467020968283
yes   222.6350034839174
it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper   32.17223598144217
you know the history of the saraband   121.40523121680599
and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again   119.55378563349961
i have extricated you from misery felton   117.02839006293685
yes we shall yet have happy days   99.29062412789422
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident   180.70891928331906
he urged the horse again into a trot   172.47948714605118
listen   36.567061232724285
noirtier   63.968199424806855
where is my son   143.33429753365473
i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone   198.75993901914387
he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man   140.54199635081508
bonacieux   182.76028208594118
that health which excellent my dear friend   74.95638678519383
the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of richelieu the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austria to declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal   70.89718025859662
let him come up   118.25935993863499
to regret the world is to regret the devil   61.16099760976826
said he   78.47786625884214
baron danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate   129.96189440625457
count may i suggest one idea to you   179.97201074696565
he inquired   92.24060878960586
in french en avant   83.54632927347012
a thousand thanks and now for the letter   21.211758230696063
come back as ambassador come back as minister come back surrounded with guards who will defend you with servants who will watch over you and then i shall no longer fear for your days and i shall be happy in seeing you   77.68887261204495
as we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the abbé faria s pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading le drapeau blanc   173.45706354467666
that will amuse you   70.66744130500781
i shall know if you lie   193.58336721596004
but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment   146.15174595741985
would you pass in his eyes for a prophet   36.43179489600489
his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one   37.054826730015606
murmured milady in english   120.27579633232564
well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one   126.19804327909603
the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed   176.7409673381049
the thing is clear as day said he   89.60803256632754
but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to me   147.59940277662676
he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve and which had the postmark marseilles 27th february delivery 6 o clock p   226.0007872368671
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued d artagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen   120.27259645739477
but peppino what has become of him   70.6932929435263
most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina while sleeping betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo   35.70520304226832
peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea   140.5585331632441
perhaps some accident has happened to him   34.257579036018
and the party must be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to london   173.44279518014147
sir will you grant me my request   163.03692302917398
she was branded   117.48984740313702
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word   130.3245738059617
albert at this moment ran in   238.7547668342205
well   123.30686770777359
they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the holders   91.9110678158869

the moment for my escape is fixed seven o clock   99.86186018044259
had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified   111.7823269734827
the president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes   158.15022380566907
so that we have twelve hours before us   123.10920630165432
therefore you see me prepared to surrender my sword for after having accused my soldiers there can be no doubt that monsieur the cardinal will end by accusing me   107.59884589637068
eugénie has left us   72.75411176193494
at the rue guénégaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay   176.7895503923421

she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair   106.23886062641395
he was her grandfather on the mother s side   64.2120304112995
of what importance is this little reptile to you   249.54576739527226
i am ready to marry m   67.43655241367725
exclaimed athos what were you saying just now about growing old   140.3468359567979

really captain groslow you are too much in fortune s way   39.14721529298703
you are to set off said the cardinal   67.60012166013402
d artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out   115.66126882713819
the heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a rival   104.11994966251198
you did not let the executioner escape then   73.05807841940144

and with us no other escort but you two   71.09017939589356
noirtier s look continued to interrogate   45.95760971068941
it was in valentine s room   115.91168846627176
look d artagnan   79.1914551609122
it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle   36.40558079124915
adieu dear captain said porthos i shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony   119.91884476722976

monseigneur i swear to you that i never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against you   24.721924278814285
i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood   130.92867723229696
the president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place   43.492751529299454
and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres   258.5407416107117
my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy   110.60828913521097
a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents   80.47836244316133
mazarin and guitant conversed together in whispers   113.8120507882143
there was no fear of her falling asleep   156.7855357850149
but does maximilian go to rome   93.77988695673264

cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of winter   158.50173176074108
remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe   159.02083546449316
you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way   92.3296704601866
one light alone was visible   187.9245313418926
hope   104.60261229422993
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest   73.95955673336115
ah no no   114.793458653822
the treasure is in the furthest a   108.73278190558372
if i were a man that would barely be possible   125.30494620881308
without her captain   149.85872237353237
but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love   130.73928352411394
at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl   55.544522606742994
but you yourself   128.5528839918342

yes to morrow   232.04801454911637
for you know more than we do   157.86363436197192
said porthos   114.35031556238476
what the devil   205.1691990126282
ah ah   203.98997178383308
by kitty s chamber he could gain that of her mistress   17.660444824884948
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity   129.36572840171516
d artagnan knew that although a gascon m   44.72273760234357
replied eugénie with her usual candor   47.46269367109994
no matter said d artagnan in his most wheedling tone   5.286352765110465
thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents   202.29290809584137
you are the notary empowered to sell the country house that i wish to purchase monsieur   95.65045971484372
immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck half past four   118.39931703349943
28 was situated at the extremity of the village   46.28945565386799
said athos smiling if it be not a secret   117.03767127699277
very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more   34.146436437949234
said monte cristo   333.52828215917907
i had provided myself with a dark lantern   188.2135502201989
i have it still   0.9781717930094942
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness   120.25566805278234
the lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the window   178.10797439898715
caderousse entered hastily   150.21327073113696
most undoubtedly   132.2585505783941
then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away   41.866776060199754
on two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed   19.806010498593338
and you know added d artagnan that whenever i catch him i will kill him this mordaunt   28.363635816893776
eagerly demanded all his three friends   68.92268499616746
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur   90.83237306579477
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde   63.0667918734566
ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung partant pour la syrie we will not go alone to the garden   75.76847961633239
the count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own   11.843305209546799
villefort hung his head d avrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes   157.76989452884715
a moment s delay said athos   77.78397329558871
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass   148.02245179012286
oh no athos   142.46032461553264
cried bertuccio whose copper complexion became livid i go to auteuil   65.32278711274849
from monsieur laporte   128.28086592366424
he is dead   34.56946740934937
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers   191.1605167105762
profession artist   143.0602324137502
gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings   166.03159356137587
besides i know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me   49.62535420141553
better study a little common prudence   75.22445719743797
i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so   121.84130113731486
in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose   134.80479238033413
we must fire as long as we have loaded guns   173.8584526455988
yes tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone   125.41428355168672
you mean then that if i leave you haydée i should die   111.44024418910514
why did you not mention his name at once   118.9396703493816
yes   200.34065754250284
the baron appears thoughtful today said monte cristo to her   122.35993524409228
what the devil are you doing here   214.16598904454858
is not that word known in france   133.7409927309928
i have worn my cuirass these twenty years kept down in this inferior rank without going forward or backward hardly half living   151.22020929828287
yes   27.594529803480796
yes   193.44272811066963
but who then is this assassin this murderer   228.52833773482632
you said you had an idea said athos   131.33476274236335
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away   160.06842645502235
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé   80.5475408647259
holà bazin come here this minute   88.77548231574802
good morning emmanuel   157.86679710442175
pray let that napkin be sent to me   54.71229007254777
i answer for bazin said aramis   133.89844276123532
bah   145.76383998837352
nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years   79.53026063044209
were i but of gentle birth   47.444567823523045
nothing   18.068406354618347
and if i have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the french captain or the count of morcerf but on the fisherman fernand the husband of mercédès the catalane   148.5567722514389
i wish what god wills   163.48519088470562
yes monsieur said d artagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me i hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business   58.99141746788253
copyright law in creating the project gutenberg™ collection   114.44450973848217
be silent i will write   131.24912754345542
he will be a dead man in a month   110.01693926084619
have i not told you so gentlemen   166.60037404370377
it formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is magnificent   186.1112668174178
count said morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours   139.52907854719365
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man   40.86790602623205
and what has became of him   115.13273952707674
march forward   171.33835716900933
then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel   73.89698883229254
i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds   73.39311886767817
that happens just lucky your excellency   81.49483140800558
oh my lord   146.70492987371057
the accusation comes from monsieur de la trémouille from the duke himself   77.65242027411892
but there as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the jolly miller without anyone host waiter or hostler coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse d artagnan spied though an open window on the ground floor a gentleman well made and of good carriage although of rather a stern countenance talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect   111.57163507820566
but said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred   56.68134003298091
comminges bowed and left   217.74025749712916
it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze   31.0424080131303
de morcerf begging me to attend the opera   240.88458746328288
unfortunately no   109.51839477869652
during this conversation dantès after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up that s all depend upon it   10.934713526831928
said d artagnan what does my lord think of that reply   97.72702274125908
come then said the prince   174.27561639078786
what do i know of the grecian affair   102.19399851820371
one from the house of arstein eskeles of vienna to baron rothschild the other drawn by baring of london upon m   94.11252736825608
answer   111.93365396164434
0059m when one thinks said caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him   160.04430728808273
enough edmond   119.61626684798973
the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire   103.88467729828204
if he detested her it would be all the better replied athos   222.3347780370944
ask his lackey how often he has had to prepare lint of him   177.92585445120073
but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you   56.50698183350353
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied   70.94655230209145
he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good humor   45.29145626309706
even athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then unfolded   108.68790755675296
but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended   187.83497176857645
but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure d artagnan   64.56071547423764
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together   195.56049294035304
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnestly   117.43944324053525
mon dieu   111.1769000530634
then aloud oh madame m   97.47209358418644
this letter is your game   140.5674338829922
well but my poor bazin reflect a little   153.3886053021668
meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him   55.88033053740669
you are free he said through me   49.140596470272385
yes yes when the campaign is over replied the gascon   98.00637789491644
leave you   107.2809696887565
when d artagnan returned to the palais royal at five o clock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing   239.50046737138797
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman   117.91689899299864
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it d artagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you   82.44940210288124
his follies as page   34.86095809116577
i have given you a great fright have i not   184.8772805027565
galloping through the bushes   121.43265159334307
antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that d artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage   26.624419420538146
he sent for me to day   105.80634390365172
have you the keys   141.47496529384588
i am a royalist replied the general   118.43402452470194
said athos   51.44276441971202
you who speak english like john bull himself are master tom lowe we your three companions   7.183632865157421
haven t you then a fourth companion   94.61958924366662
on seeing the appointed signal groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the gentlemen   179.05920919202472
the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a louis for his trouble and they went on their way   121.28650395452735
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half scared to his master   20.169175257928444
but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious nobody thought of asking whence they came   176.95392832328434
here is a glass with one already prepared said villefort entering the room   196.9071895209006
and i monsieur de chatillon   55.02911382703248
he found as provident a host and a fresh horse   138.167954269515
certainly it is wrong said monte cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent   156.54509041633685
what are you about   229.55747742466826
how long they did so nobody knows   54.17808285560423
no said caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5 000 francs   97.6611128504193
the two rooms looked on to the street a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage   69.31514288991008
oh be easy   64.25184328965614
twisted his mustache proudly placing his hand upon his hip   127.10049449947182
asked lord de winter   58.230349942900894
but even while they watched his daring progress edmond s foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear   146.9987911321224
for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos   118.01224834345801
besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which la jeune amélie replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come   58.528308413096596
but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced touch it not   189.4380436382144
be christians   199.9537345286219
now i have these proofs albert and i am in your confidence no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal but i come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me   11.511216449720038
he had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening   5.1595652503886384
well said the latter a young woman of about twenty six or twenty eight years of age and a man of from thirty five to forty have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your eminence   113.30445529453853
through what medium   11.73248256732218
baptistin who rode in front attended the count   103.71643234781098
you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands   47.160963612466816
forever   44.80206606922775
we   44.59926920225858
very true said monte cristo   112.50535603928216
in half an hour   181.07213414898678
there isn t a morsel of bread in the house   94.7930004533288
true replied faria we are prisoners   180.29288736107424
but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride   15.530909644195859
mousqueton   118.27019497789124
courage   183.49515369517852
the king and the cardinal are the best of friends   62.26737319569182
how can i tell   59.25428822190163
still as he was the very perfection of a door keeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife   161.6690896825833
but i have none   200.05508747105438
40048m when monte cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with m   97.55465780459784
why the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each other   175.82521047055786
try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without interruption   220.25313681303808
at these words he took up a silver bell and rang it   103.72934791362883
i do not know him returned monte cristo   171.53679724795848
do not attempt it   29.316302395385463

beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chaussée d antin to m   72.77373392657557

our vessel was surrounded and amongst the custom house officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues mortes   212.39678635662744

as there is a diamond let us sell it   62.49274754132433
exclaimed morrel   94.77275472040368
but these tears flowed for another   15.249219269178553
but will no one remain in the house my lord   120.03286583986878
oh i can not believe you   29.558993565434378
simply a count   66.49922449148183
he turned around and mordaunt stood before him   127.76034606887993
her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her   166.49495529036068
do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over   155.01086052083065
it is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at tréport i felt the electric shock   183.15313859941276
oh   129.31074080525065

sit down and i will read it again   48.950554378000604
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders   150.16735105038356
besides i expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk   116.2275733717287
after they got along a few paces the passage widened   45.69291181768615
i must go to the chamber for our life is not an idle one   121.46746220692158
my orders   206.1857374127743

i wish to speak to you   88.32386690210363
she will come and throw herself between us   10.752306905601827
i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband   225.65093568063838
i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance   110.83077049514996
aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence   125.0400742420996
yes   193.71702545240137
you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said   148.72310764938737
all these proofs of an energetic resolution which albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother   92.12987035439349
well ask your worthy jailer what favor i this instant solicited of him   89.01173713602839
cried caderousse raising himself on his elbows   174.01339145834694
monsieur cried dantès i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity   128.37718095635586
if they come tell them what has happened   169.82661148748315
sign the treaty then monseigneur said aramis   204.81257628008177
pardieu monsieur i can t be more sure   53.78503825869733
as he said these words the count of morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window   245.50407679387496
but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body   107.88634962279687
in half an hour la ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their heart s content   68.77365573553516
don t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source   109.21109959222143
julie said he to her cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs   61.07452673636694
having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies   102.39463446783665
pen ink and paper then called fernand loudly   98.40971893237062
and his scotch guard to louis xi   37.335832835087885
he said nothing   127.5415291227089
if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as d artagnan says will carry the letter   92.93254476732949
but tell me what do you ask   115.73209121787927
in the meantime we will have a merry night   177.0432898823342
and she opened the letter and read madame being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand i have commanded my son the count de guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens and that this victory can not fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe   161.41999796059633
no no answered dantès   118.20830931364975
valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to w   71.05340407842675
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton   128.33060581413338
come said beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend   47.09775959616013
if not why there would be no promotion   280.79626465918807
and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony   157.30074896771396
he may have gone by the other door   170.7640318537579
you understand me replied villefort affectionately   82.78646905162833
creek to the east in a right line   187.0891845380653
we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared   141.37308116110506
i will give them to you on condition that you let me go   45.69408923473203
i tell you i am sure of it continued the host   90.81949659550438
my hand   150.2492914961971
one of a most dangerous kind i give you notice   163.2803823747508
i depend upon your word my lord   73.32267761787733
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected   102.22413386382708
then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so   90.5043508599951
said bonacieux they took good care not to tell me that   124.88453419765607
alas my dear friend said faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not and i need not attempt to explain to you   133.69149013582614
a servant entered summoned by albert s ring of the bell   149.19421926132566
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector   141.7395637310533
morrel can not give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it   140.48112940000985
that is not all sir continued mazarin   146.9602601464442
i thought so replied emmanuel   196.72955776735523
she was the exact duplicate of the other pharaon and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo   132.24636873878396
teresa was sixteen and vampa seventeen   33.34696990354131
maximilian chapter 104   14.53346127347669
your eminence is right replied milady   102.73287623734991
the waiter did as he was desired   122.82215655659733
said mazarin uneasily   102.58080014145455
alas   34.528903796928745
do you think so   80.9378912778296
not crush that accursed race   167.97400870369816
the bearer of this letter will tell you madame what i dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of transit   110.82643062418553
de tréville was informed by d artagnan and porthos of the circumstance   175.40264951150942
our host   180.61165991392977
he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him   5.513642379468635
no you are right said athos   209.46732753823215
my god my god   126.66241941972834
did i hear rightly monsieur said monte cristo that you served at yanina   113.4984038219119
my lord said la ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness   63.60425327630671
and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper   132.26766313195208
then mazarin is still mazarin   87.12107300961381
cried the jesuit for that thesis touches closely upon heresy   180.23198142054116
they are contained in this box which you will not open until you are on the other side of the channel   54.580365915113234
mme   223.62732677230264
to a certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be a general of the army   98.05139118356601
certainly   155.8614511482671
then running to the door exclaimed help help   102.86428751291882
m   29.498122416825936
you are a generous man albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment   174.16567795340745
cried d artagnan you will get me turned off   18.22315548823711
no reply   107.10168053998021
yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall   123.50098431437723
you start for paris   84.41399478085044
thanks to the influence of m   173.87908337556564
and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter   82.9822913346772
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre   117.1203117304981
this way light us downstairs bernouin   37.994061199297875
the steward attempted to expostulate   90.11477079598806
de tréville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the bastille   124.90157893066308
do you know modern greek asked he   122.72726801753817
at herlier planchet who led the column turned to the left   111.15220249424038
blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin   93.6686918756536
said he showing d artagnan a place where it had been pierced through   175.29687086139035
he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age   154.03262316921445
but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond   211.2303109292053
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him   111.24281151928453
said d artagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer   227.87764913077947
why sir a man of about fifty   132.25684666037506
like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen   111.5393149890696
well as after my death the command devolves on you as mate assume the command and bear up for the island of elba disembark at porto ferrajo ask for the grand marshal give him this letter perhaps they will give you another letter and charge you with a commission   103.18499766104982
danglars smiled at the good natured pleasantry of the count   58.47635988508457
gentlemen said athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair   196.57841884075106
the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast   203.3131976683251
of russia are the only two monarchs of their set on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers   166.02136146758687
let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts   52.58132759185037
how did they act with regard to the maréchale d ancre   164.61250113008947
no no said fernand restraining him stay   288.8322774609595
but lord de winter might suspect him   228.9833815956009
de boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twenty four hours since m   127.92056836654457
i will search for them madame said de winter and doubtless i shall find them   105.33294796204376
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace   73.85046362550571
but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom   96.97925652736453
like a philosopher   122.58473824111837
d avrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about it   220.12951597963064
come sir he said lend me twenty francs   175.26601014234365
caderousse   119.02481621451385
what is this name of monte cristo   5.942883312927449
cried aramis almost in a state of delirium   114.3538492128194
no doubt you come to join the princes   69.94154409118077
oh indeed i can not permit you to go   142.86443612439248
ah   192.49568902025868
and she began to shriek more loudly clinging to the bars of the window help   38.70825774348273
as they were passing onward athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city   199.26511690140018
franz found himself in utter darkness   194.10834673449972
it was the kiosk to which we were going   97.11722198562103
he eats then   168.9966869662448
and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it   263.4102979500834
on the contrary sir on the contrary said louis xviii   70.04104601178895
it s worth eighty   217.63552353919093
arrived at the hotel it was not long before athos entered   91.96267982930931
and we can now hear how the poor child is   122.82716769636626
cried albert   167.01762670940573
i had been at the seminary from nine years old   85.71758032612347
and d artagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche   139.95457724588147
i wish to speak with him   70.68513304604411
and here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money   150.90237026353353
lower   208.95013066052186
it was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we promised   138.89616445162855
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more   117.80587997516004
that count of monte cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night   159.23477706859165
ah you think very lightly of it   180.20290787280257
oh i can not tell what she says to me   113.08663046491351
on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing   126.05848793618348
an opal colored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue ocean   87.81028301613159
bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable   160.26519342359302
he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame de villefort no longer being able to avoid answering   136.3242720642252
pardieu   20.81508598453081
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it   251.04432189530593
a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m   21.273709958714022
it is a little worse for the journey but that s no matter   194.5712548485093
then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first   104.89891173295622
by whom   93.02140589963946
before our letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon   152.36959149782405
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor   69.8512717019401
he made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a walk   185.600669021027
porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after d artagnan   237.30437477065033
gray blue eyes more gray than blue   59.56998550243425
come that is something   86.99623328817194
and the result of that letter you well know madame was my arrest   19.915890486737453
i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures   154.164707608068
d   65.44678577609668
well   44.826940206145466
asked d artagnan   214.8081736207094
now who was that someone   89.71247000465029
sit down and let us talk it over   72.77321328968483
there is but little reason why i should delay you   250.35236426753954
he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen s apartments   87.06656998028095
alas alas   41.22569622381617
50065m woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that i ought to blush   160.4866930369793
besides to tell truth whilst d artagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with athos true hearted open athos   144.31865527449634
they are sinking   72.9808086189897
it is well returned the voice   123.02402195782989
take notice that you are shut up captured   127.08392367588749
he has not one that is more expeditious   91.28661551878119
inquired gaetano   91.50975420879534
then said the traveller take these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings   132.49019440102097
de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy   53.24686137936924
baptiste give me yesterday s paper cried beauchamp   12.728630204762851
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo   41.44358192831555
nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo   158.32206649637308
if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping   88.71292526085486
at this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper   130.5810031383968
30137m go then into the drawing room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you   43.719401036050044
i can do something better than that sir i can speak flemish   192.4989611721861
and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk only   48.63058631989108
yes said the king but i do not wish to be touched by any of those men   128.9933671233127
you lie   178.08515284966137
no   116.7775315614064
buckingham was their messiah   62.00060426575648
you are a brave soldier one of the few remaining veterans of the days of henry iv   173.8205931591617
respect to fallen majesty   69.41306871894108
gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest   174.99503979693122
the count of monte cristo   92.06773485024226
you have a friend monsieur du vallon whom i like much   117.58068598090154
a telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error   78.20544652827806
and he said nothing as he died   84.93740775135487
he will be found   18.968609800940897
but no matter   31.21132572741567
yes   124.84351137042133
and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name   137.68640331617462
you can not think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger   115.81448350910837
it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased   96.46173776894791
i should like another sort of oath better said d artagnan to himself   201.6907995966901
exclaimed the count   39.543669317664595
friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead men   151.36785473425303
well said franz anything new   165.61893920546225
and then there won t be any parliament at all   106.95360294381987
on my word replied the count not more than another   251.4403643269731
had m   27.06340005407823
grunted porthos   66.09183976813506
tis instinct your honor   177.47471270267386
you thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of valentine   75.92415733134155
the glass cutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him   38.84425381915142
valery   63.972850944376574
yet five minutes afterwards the rabbit was dead   194.91126196617387
asked his wife pale as death   72.60030674581157
do not my mother and you agree   104.77569944931702
replied dantès   201.54507964222967
it took some time for d artagnan to resume this little dialogue   28.317492330430483
i think these fellows will never come   144.98060064108031
bonacieux re entered   68.99002975878983
thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily   49.929888889485625
for what   137.28504480335675
de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother   50.51198678684858
let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear buckingham   75.32760337846047
the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder   87.1591489323416
the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window   147.76792191965654
ah   151.11565044332815
it is ten years today since i saved your father s life who wished to die   190.5639769402954
yes said caderousse   182.879472183249
in the bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort   33.23114770603313
to see him so self satisfied reconciles me with myself   159.29523076190875
morrel in person   153.6263099659672
yes   7.083287410392742
in which the plot thickens chapter xii   318.0119543050057
here he said i am very straightforward in my dealings take your choice   104.23420985329089
asked the girl   93.00045551018735
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her chamber   121.15849725113094
but i say no more madame   111.72807648427377
oh very shortly madame said he   142.66674080635664
but he was mistaken   154.23713691404888
said she   207.88662405396843
never   176.94986549880497
then turning toward the prisoner take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight   205.55317307461408
the queen looked at him surprised   94.55448519791683
in a second d artagnan had made three terrible thrusts at mordaunt all of which touched but only pricked him   229.78975431069608
i say that i have reflected   160.17057375291023
he rushed toward d artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms   24.85846095002526
said the young man   60.04704787802886
he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name   60.50329347574717
long life to the great cardinal   115.92526447618556
well madame said porthos if he owed you more than five crowns your horsedealer is a thief   81.06872559974242
but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine   164.55943003962113
one believes readily what he wishes to believe   46.13848557215201
you lie   47.845289623055365
i told you so   134.66609710239763
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character   118.30653560052289
one in rue de vaugirard the other rue de la harpe   78.31642710869835
patience patience   150.63107344896835
we must understand each other said the duke   262.299288674718
cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of eugénie has never been admitted   163.19950655559853
permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to valentine permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself can not proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility   144.775691407858
replied d artagnan   194.3475516586873
impossible doctor   143.87672050117385
de nargonne had married m   199.55091403701712
then that person is a most amiable person   108.65673709028016
it is madame danglars   49.36393361207004
well take them   181.46468349878745
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrate s first impulse was to pause   164.64869023105592
and i hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before   329.6379566137719
every one likes his own uniform best my lord   78.10226257628985
a paltry piece of business   234.99496821476077
thence he saw the king the queen and monsieur mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty   109.02916143859383
my selfishness will blind me replied morrel whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation   72.52782740072561
his boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to england   88.44636436361068
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte   95.15506876355032
for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind   169.52977254979464
i am going on a mission   94.7985874438768
yes   8.47667976115288
and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father s conduct added the incorrigible marquise   143.25772148217112
still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction   149.17176475046813
and what are you afraid of then   218.1668782681023
i don t know what it was   128.96609686579714
felton entered   90.9468529179025
albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble   43.47346605656945
he asked   130.06032832290225
it has been mentioned but the article is not mine   91.87026696373314
d artagnan   76.95644542793423
nay said caderousse one can t always work one is not a dog   98.45245808118851
de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen   69.22436600669846
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand   208.96067960453036
did you see the postscript   169.07077800303588
give me your arm and let us go   45.53737042133817
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed   142.46101898064302
without remorse said he   222.06116880926942
cried buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse   150.56788988825446
she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door   98.08143457334188
and if you wished to die you would choose this death count   101.30378180506357
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you   135.79181059077618
in a very simple manner colonel said d artagnan   157.9135604287811
the story volume two chapter 28   10.72776533836543
i beg pardon interrupted beauchamp   17.885790041647013
the inspector could not contend against this accusation   68.647185014358

nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first   179.85323106370623
never had she appeared more beautiful   91.03590220652119
be satisfied all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve even the queen herself   144.91391263548522
a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke   103.98634429176134
it was a gloomy dusty looking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immemorial   173.01525211616502
let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to do   92.05889616371684
talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy   122.44520522488926
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me   232.78486725840628
it is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you   168.39960518780856
imagine the large and splendid corso bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces with their balconies hung with carpets and their windows with flags   130.38924501202393
you ought to be brave for two reasons the first is that you are a gascon and the second is that you are my son   61.97163439498031
that s right   44.779416076339345
yes but i got down to defend monsieur de comminges and my horse was taken away   197.69977049284643
valentine you are an angel   135.4560488366551
the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening   114.62969713389153
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family   98.55245589290752
now my father is not coming to paris is he   77.99881232891966
it was i said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance   41.70398559046316
excellent   146.64295219071892
night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dantès agitation   130.7496376099899
and if it were mercédès poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of marseilles   117.7868031223335
then remarked madame de villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous aqua tofana that they said was lost at perugia   96.0899214534965
do not lie my angel said d artagnan smiling   54.271604799394865
be punished alone for the first miserable man   43.14805927445795
morrel he has stayed behind sick at palma   217.69032362064087
said athos   64.84244119574898
but my lord if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man   155.7441368843655
exclaimed the young man hastily   28.94820734620663
teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him   197.22332014991395
be it so replied the cardinal   215.37617568775448
your philosophy convinces me on my honor   82.90453683196856
however proud you may be you will not refuse to accept one of them and to request your three companions to accept the others that is in order to make war against us   106.55555426671508
what   61.74802473927251
then approaching noirtier pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation   224.04023431247094
he rings   56.29345471017044
d artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly   140.8750421657768
no replied morrel   56.01612588221904
the blush of pride mounted to the count s forehead as this thought passed through his mind   177.43621593676377
porthos sighed   140.14096523108552
stop a moment said the deputy as dantès took his hat and gloves   165.0839479967917
yes   57.864248219433
dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands and said has your majesty perused yesterday s report   95.58800860952601
alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made them on the fragments of all the hope which god had given them   158.15901116832026
the parliament   68.99135439114505
have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts   131.29565834501042
exactly   137.1535747436487
all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where   74.19745221524747
and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat   198.98390018399482
one evening i went according to custom to a house which i frequented with much pleasure when one is young what can be expected   196.69749296334544
you will exact   72.58723229176218
and you monsieur d artagnan what do you want   207.91906017375817
if he turned up an ace first he won   53.149986269584176
the men i have put to flight will return reinforced   146.28279276795706
i see that you understand french   169.98610702111895
the jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a man   183.91070896503396
on the contrary sire set the example   33.489872044431294
the baroness knew how calm villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat   174.1649982822857
no replied the count   90.3205900760607
he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality   197.15186370159583
you are active vigorous and you have arms   225.19551940667748
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape   167.28849578057844
at this demand d artagnan gave his name very modestly emphasized the title of compatriot and begged the servant who had put the question to him to request a moment s audience of m   158.92075452801197
he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern   37.6589127924923
oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus   192.45508688736237
and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis   201.2335960393448
was born   126.29894084593936
and we start in his carriage then   89.63280382444856
i wish to consult you about some thing   125.6476203599023
said the procurator maliciously   84.57021476659591
that you know is my daily promenade   125.39010693486561
the day began to decline carriages were passing and repassing   156.17943924745288
i was three years old said haydée   118.22012036647388
why   111.71959340162591
let me reflect a little   185.89083161926783
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawing rooms   45.865051418880114
but beware if you and your musketeers are guilty   161.6916113824627
athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula i make you a knight   161.94128594698518
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured   168.29493899840196
without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the ice cold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom   179.58835026815905
mousqueton thy pistols said d artagnan   70.58967671230465
said he to porthos   121.74598723803861
bertuccio my steward takes me for a roman   270.1492437481239
mine also are from him   10.341727968223623
asked de guiche   101.29079796908891
and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m   236.9856345750399
you will not find her   168.68608210170464
oh i am very presuming i am aware   194.7834707732332
you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world   117.08947067737938
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although i place the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est   196.469524192737
madame de villefort remained immersed in thought   164.86705282507813
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below   121.16709873683305
he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to listen   67.93564406527014
then tell the men to be in readiness don t tell them why now   157.85063410096868
your husband then is at last dead   203.60552373418574
it is six o clock said madame de villefort evidently agitated   137.52625704560202
edmond dantès   45.728736921081065
i will go directly was edmond s reply   186.84974631985085
this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured   97.77499798770262
as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister   201.769602050319
then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring   178.7421872315113
andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position   80.50088005933762
well said the young woman what you dreaded has happened   124.66286023655869
i command thee   253.15754428400214
it is not for nothing we are but twenty years old above all if we were born at tarbes   21.43364727856084
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo   126.03212082117513
but what will people say   243.33207400976795
this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice   47.78037397172797
but having received the signal that i might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sun dial for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhéry even a sun dial and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longer by the by sir do you think dormice eat them   58.613468868276854
do you know of what he died   129.53618860544236
no dear morcerf   137.79386557270124
the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden box   214.8977006057787
because then i knew not who you were   121.68790184119649
said grimaud   133.67896815204148
the road is never very safe during fair time   100.83182886456899
monte cristo went to meet him   63.18953499485462
the smallpox   108.27078358373022
said franz   119.87736474206726
oh this is very interesting said debray   113.87147823338094
and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m   188.08650502950425
he double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in   113.95962729219563
olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master grumbling   105.78612820867626
you are the chevalier s prisoner   124.97724396218554
should you like to be rich and your own master   116.90948961989459
who is in command here   147.92900740693833
next after monsieur de condé comes the duke of orleans   194.396405470636
for you see the bright side of everything   180.99419777465332
50157m my father i will know who my father is said the obstinate youth   76.0929697057467
asked milady warmly   190.73988929901412
no   46.26075595551927
i shall very soon learn that language by signs valentine and i promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us   92.62197678840393
the island of monte cristo   158.24956517841065
yes madame   115.21504257845712
but what is the matter   44.905486582970696
chapter xiv   139.78631561398925
3   69.70545912416713
this edifice which i have been so long preparing which i have reared with so much care and toil is to be crushed by a single touch a word a breath   78.34209803083769
the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay said aramis   44.34527601127775
in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majesty s shoulder   67.0663015786404
perhaps he would accept   18.241261029792696
impossible   185.82630519948162
ah   42.648561684982
his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same   102.68397865614233
as soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who boat hook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved   63.52400434688744
his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded   180.0745173598014
who wrote for particulars concerning my father   153.69056637785582
but you may use it replied lord wilmore   64.51757532302145
the third then fell from the clouds i suppose   94.25890070813182
you madame remained under the arbor   42.03801098281153
penelon said the captain i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold   131.25136121689283
so it is   89.9526743611843
hush whispered de guiche these are cavaliers   138.8100676048319
underneath a lamp in an inn anywhere they ask are you one of the fronde   42.55594375601906
at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilian s taste   164.23680774904238
the young man recollected his promise and was silent   85.76119389043231
at that time i was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me   106.31561540833069
but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis   186.3788216558969
the count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart   216.56553683185246
said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing   122.02606898467461
it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad   104.3730313764533
said he   86.45116798111293
well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man   91.4234994048274
de villefort her devotion to the elder dantès   157.91881816367254
i won t be their dupe i will answer for it   129.10082951850546
it seems to me said d artagnan with a thousand livres each i do not speak as a spartan but as a procurator this word procurator roused porthos   99.64180238954357
it is a handsome uniform   107.94748027793898
every evening he shuts himself in there   190.68510985745434
he was at the window calling ali a horse for m   126.06074655859403
d artagnan went straight to the sergeant   183.89397185212596
the king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow   188.4123356741909
he was on villefort s premises had arrived there by scaling the wall   17.00607984749007
said porthos as for me i could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much   117.45671968623753
cried albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance   52.721774108371676
now said the steward what have you to tell me   95.96057633922916
adieu chevalier   96.2245750817027
it was even according to our present manners something like an infamous action   65.81058756277446
what i have said i have said answered caderousse   133.4663653051735
oh yes   116.95534860910232
debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it   85.57479122725935
well said d artagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death   75.20636724755674
replied d artagnan with feverish volubility   157.63826473158514
from twelve to two o clock danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker   67.28124876846388
nothing was heard but cries of live the musketeers   123.63621776716464
said morrel with tearful eyes   184.26604640074726
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her   45.7684519249499
the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop   40.76806736280993
you see he has a truly royal escort   142.50974754664017
the curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art one of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time   42.63933403121506
exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brows   155.55221927010606
it was impossible   218.29563714542098
asked the young girl   131.9454176487847
i leave it to monsieur d artagnan to name them my lord   43.219985103433416
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea   9.425947127572073
then we must fight   67.72664870662678
the explosion soon followed   130.2235033135216
there terminates at least to the present moment the duty i had to fulfill toward you   120.88249151932585
free without my aid   122.67797261891242
at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions   262.1994800265078
never mind take these   47.02531459718466
he soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his felicity   114.00674084670479
and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied   48.39170598114369
i breathe more freely   36.563723581882726
gloves of gray kid matching the hat well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand   193.13593274985737
but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium   72.91958381066281
if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m   151.74572546685118
is not death in my house   131.12886838108633
time presses   167.28406892789764
an excuse for us   140.4623845490726
what do you mean   158.25442170099456
the same evening the following was read in le messager by telegraph   166.16721697214214
it is i who cherish no resentment   124.99521062606429
go then take what guards you find here and pursue him   122.08464840494801
said the old man   161.0433148246756
but what are your intentions   175.39407428584065
he remained scarcely a man   41.23135200812712
the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail   60.695608905066955
some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning   83.55403361356522
i have never accomplished anything alone said d artagnan shaking his head   51.377097748765664
come i am a good sort of a prince added he and although i like not puritans i do them justice   151.7655302840259
my mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside   170.01282654941423
well replied d artagnan bending his mouth to athos s ear and lowering his voice milady is marked with a fleur de lis upon her shoulder   206.6905070433054
i want friends   134.36812207718984
behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure   131.20039551665664
but said d artagnan now i think of it what is to prevent our beginning to night   192.55039580739424
madame he said to the duchess i have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you   161.7516087373148
jealousy fury offended pride all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love urged her to make a revelation   32.42981238762644
i will try   171.9036345803089
danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage   152.77073715569782
however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison   22.74968218641574
have you confidence in me   106.90001326162874
look   121.29083820509229
ah may you be a true prophet   87.9822331165236
yes   234.9451952493299
she had succeeded   167.51636672660004
yes sir replied franz   116.42352582937261
you did well to defend the honor of a woman   24.51605396951453
at the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man   53.69142929677559
it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m   99.13247117163027
yes   49.58566853924614
there exist no imprecations she did not pour out against you   89.42718955449189
but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations   153.04009663199696
he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls   102.8372445278477

germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac bicarat and two other guardsmen who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts   26.839992363844715
and as you say i am myself agitated feverish and out of sorts   65.52143909474916
i was chosen   110.5427035807089
de wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinal s favor   50.47332854948503
faithful to his mission of vengeance athos had requested to be conducted to the garden   143.09218620949514
the instant debray had touched the ground he was at the carriage door   57.77277108425208
grimaud rose   148.10259641866259
but in going out he put the knife into his bosom   176.06004701908958
perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so violently   122.93071912169431
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand   29.762536546988144
but danglars restrained me   185.80346487632735
yes my lord the pure parliament   107.60010600628858
was the cry in every direction   109.99525665843997
i am called the count de guiche continued the young man   168.62275548559464
hope my friend repeated the count   43.08060028083838
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry   96.91419295006317
on their side the three musketeers were much attached to their young comrade   149.55695090439627
peppino chapter 115   135.9555603332385
asked aramis   18.767371019045726
the walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid   137.25076594792932
have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape   150.87510416496994
what can you mean   20.472573679216097
it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other   148.20587432967972
said athos   15.07434164108065
but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron   149.51742724729678
the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim   72.02205081371815
but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses   170.3024326436801

what the devil are you doing there   114.85465950689498
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative   101.57449029993673
what said debray laughing   121.86399848245335
he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by   128.7761934981703
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you   148.56432448311259
in my wife s chamber on the first flight where they are dressing his wounds   173.30737110940447
you do not doubt it   182.61066040328933
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton   80.31436096704891
ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey   95.54952139316536
the other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep   30.071907363625343
cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword   196.62140134134492

mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him   80.64268151798234
to the installation of my rival at m   190.6442386413466

sit down morrel and wait   142.85513912307277
but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening ah   180.35684113718514
and that man what has your eminence done with him   116.1984469838268
come then said lord winter   18.88469232443485
and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only   108.84543052463717
no no   47.980176011564524

i mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking dicing   151.96909449317826
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us   6.514022109773151

your hand madame your hand and i depart   1.5307959635459412
the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs   12.330324388619971
then he went out   63.28428810483517
ah   76.19465286858667
we have secured him   159.89126656484314
dandré is not a man to be accused of treason   62.0867042192998
god pardon me   33.15843785358847
said d artagnan to himself   42.93255115606054
if you like replied the latter   125.17773103585215
they were heartrending   232.14157326602907
for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me   181.8448275895011
d artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her   55.9937112756873
i am come to talk to you about a thousand things   64.9015251710059

and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude   31.462678528286588
we know him said athos he never left the king   209.53273901016945

how much do you suppose he possesses   92.09975291064912
the king has nothing like it   7.503113844750146
yes and your conversation is most interesting   72.469723817068
he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop   219.07359189607746
the citizen followed him   88.11844119445982
i have told you that i believe i know him   119.119941955703
did you pass through the corso   106.93589636623189
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthos s horse and that of d artagnan   85.83195083907603
cæsar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them   112.10587447389453
wilkom suster said planchet   127.37813099852782
asked the count   193.90528510345155
i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself   159.2306607186514
then turning to the baroness may i ask how mademoiselle danglars is   129.333574762738
one hardly a young man   124.65234994800976
no i feel that i have reached the goal and i will go no farther   147.46836789290964
i was still stupid from our yesterday s debauch   174.95964428334537
said he it is a pity they are not really related   182.5874314207256
andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out   168.54933411005953
oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the sainte marguérite islands   136.47936605275305
these gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the italians in effrontery   116.25260520597185
another possessed all mercédès heart   148.59408822919696
said dantès   118.68341572730722
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother s bed   211.15796293353145
why really i know no one said the major   28.72198609301391
tomorrow morning answered the innkeeper   81.71871877567041
he had no means of resistance   97.82601547279621
asked aramis   65.16526001703957
as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him   159.1153134149693
on whose side   80.11393095889667
i won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then i lost again   241.1705935911909
how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto ferrajo   134.94308736137182
let us proceed   209.1001966549669
apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that i should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether i am as he says too old for action   44.78545257648365
exclaimed athos extending his hand to d artagnan   196.50239514132357
the officer of the guard then with his chessboard   74.49484396062041
how so   45.63599805521328
and that was you   2.6135620197808294
de tréville who detected him at once   85.9020036856281
nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like   13.177857753832853
the dead are everywhere said morrel   156.93058085827246
then i saw no more   26.05721281543387
to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i   52.614767180225314
d artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to her   71.62955070377473
they adopted as a maxim for they too had maxims that it was of very little consequence that women children and old men should die so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy   148.12109129695895
alas yes returned the italian   64.01937437164035
two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal   179.45462051061247
but to return to what we were saying   72.02288252766922
40306m volume five 50009m 50011m 50019m chapter 96   132.8318666695555
and you my dear boy   156.74988081612815
ha ha said château renaud here come some friends of yours viscount   136.44281398350307
no   98.96529004311972
two guards received bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported him   144.12530292600783
i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years   154.68040677980417
to horse   179.26666063260294
d artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing   43.87997060419741
sir cried the latter am i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house   44.486271693120045
i can not make you share the fate i have planned for myself   136.71841051602243
now m   93.61147587779493
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet   21.89014347500813
oh   79.37362825666042
the rendezvous the first words that albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count   83.92241990321047
yes answered maximilian but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us   89.26106373376362
the deuce you say   89.96750157658767
i confess i am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in italy justice is only paid when silent in france she is paid only when she speaks   95.53153790783779
the reason why i am now dissatisfied is that i have not a clear appreciation of the past   39.57766535117598
pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs   96.65511886708029
do you agree with aramis   204.44869076102526
come sir   134.3252558601158
having told you this begin   98.95299224911894
to travel either way a passport was necessary   176.47191087887396
he is going to the opera   97.73331388486102
why did you leave the closet monsieur d artagnan   173.3068790271993
so much the better   189.23206675022163
in fact a great noise was heard in the ante chamber   85.31771277699914
at least so d artagnan declared to himself   114.88114671863019
and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard   210.48717171362972
the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed   178.36369406079064
calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes   139.77854952899588
i was going to drink a small glass of it if fourreau had not told me i was called   135.40008005435243
athos was for a few moments thoughtful   192.44281175762978
i admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister   31.58206300140715
oh yes   209.59960133168215
ah monsieur you may take my word when i tell you anything   97.2884330458732
instead of signing i will go to you and we will fly   223.56329412720402
inquired the man with a strong italian accent   117.59754795044114
see paragraph 1   125.62104197022894
fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry mercédès   72.92407200221831
the motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of france and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy   168.42558029573877
you are too late madame   39.68600132221739
then in these trunks i presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to need your plain clothes and your uniform   148.5470371723422
and two or three times i fancied that i had heard it before   116.8353255937053
come this way gentlemen   104.5282167730266
and wherefore fire   104.17760482889663
i will see the queen   191.2542241911245
a hundred francs   95.44424482231568
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors   7.53355292217546
the cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small casket   142.31216079025063
he is going with me   112.08879456342085
he would then be lost and france perhaps with him   231.72466826575396
monsieur said m   142.50730020726127
yes i share your hopes   61.69833840783276
and why pray master la ramee   103.26204087244463
gentlemen said albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready   50.38691412792659
he motioned to valentine to approach   214.6448708931249
are you then come from m   56.587602372378115
i will remain with monsieur le comte   109.21014937741752
monsieur cardinal has enlightened me on that head   50.89991239978268
and they finished her off with pistol and dagger   119.15886814013078
is it my affair   43.63265838776553
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not drink alone   97.35439293719469
be silent madame cried felton and do not speak to me thus   20.970318363220755
oh i was arranging a little surprise for you   205.62309200725258
you will see the same at every opening from this palace to which i should lead you   94.76397035019664
but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep   137.17896144311794
a secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen   5.757846608005664
on the contrary i take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman   170.2289848511763
certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it   90.73465369984928
coquenard firm upon his legs would have declined all relationship with m   261.27147147487335
the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition   90.4035392241893
i had need of distraction   78.15146124520737
but to suffer for him is happiness   28.868603310787876
you must be fatigued from yesterday   104.98600786022456
consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of m   70.42777103559371
i can not speak latin responded the marquise   127.93944861714927
independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man   213.75877441419317
whom do you mean by they   134.33511779452198
ah monsieur   136.8518263749505
my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated   75.8384684126854
he venture himself amongst us to be hung   54.76313318520069
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king   142.91146237696495
i do not desire to do otherwise   129.71942280802148
which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers   10.642911192174978
you know said the queen that they want to take the king away from me   146.63109125336973
our landlord s to be sure   133.1507717692667
albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments   112.44987808492745
le comte de soissons by the grand prior by the duc de longueville by the duc d eubœuf by the comte d harcourt by the comte de la roche guyon by m   147.2573518667337
at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dantès with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones   65.69112235396176
chapter 112   204.51560560931267
no monseigneur   191.69918194123926
the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which monte cristo excelled   94.45776535235036
porthos exclaimed   32.08122039597502
50239m ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed   168.73469751372753
and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses   125.62118386671408
but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way   56.83779545869941
i could not find them   176.66826959365966
but monsieur does not tell you silence with respect to me silence with respect to my friends   151.74963469916247
everything else might be guessed but not that   175.8632198930964
monseigneur   227.09625805791092
but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing   69.18369051849388
his friends   16.92951875121318
well you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him   133.46422520461897
coquenard   28.010935745131093
yes   108.20498479440181
because i alone know what   159.82822395660014
what on earth are you talking of   158.50297088599237
yes madame said the young man   178.734840409739
the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated   43.41486323957194
the timely arrival of d artagnan in paris   165.8066127987792
50229m as he repassed the catalans the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman   53.80148347527012
look at the arms   124.56405293945123
and had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment   19.68437138858664
at the moment he passed through the gateway into the street the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped although it was in the month of august and lifted his hat which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head pulling it eagerly over his eyes   90.92565297514244
they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore   200.62774562134396
do you think it is worth while   58.07157653189431
50189m oh   55.27737112996526
he murmured   208.2487316924941
he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask   110.65098764302124
for you monsieur said planchet presenting the billet to the young man   97.34420797560252
so that i fear he will never return   175.65332985614344
my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude   32.75833624310674
looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded   65.01454664678664
de boville took the paper danglars presented him and read received of baron danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs to be repaid on demand by the house of thomson french of rome   170.4078481091954
his eye was calm and even brilliant   7.230415753035231
the most profound terror reigned throughout the house   17.096512779654716
nothing   156.5619727527428
however i m glad not to fight them until to morrow   64.46106141651572
certainly   55.24734446201438
said the queen radiant   158.14637466439734
but now listen to this   50.383735262028864
danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out   75.99228443493044
de villefort   117.43907310069837
the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview   45.792698769777985
he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague   140.57196746994498
what passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony can not be told in words   112.49157149323969
we are for the king and the princes added athos   133.27992808845056
villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return   125.58583251676603
but what say you to raoul s fancy   71.46685893479727
yes replied d artagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion st   142.7322887249259
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth   186.32526543021766
said d artagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of devotion   110.07362609989542
the doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day and very fond of valentine whose birth he had witnessed   153.73838470301854
he said   198.79367649211946
when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted   128.66586635655173
besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort   120.5110663353738
he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son   155.05447619554587
most willingly   104.17845885085022
did he tell you so   161.2524160371141
during the darkness as before my supper was brought   131.3199077449349
how was this jealousy manifested   125.86853435771035
inquired valentine much agitated   143.80860195604114
madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their example   48.63413361802006
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan   119.95559986737514
years of suffering in my opinion count double and i have suffered for twenty years   73.89761454563798
but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy   93.25992203626055
now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer i beseech you   120.33189847950072
france needs you   118.48468512636825
by notre dame   90.72657836443247
bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led d artagnan into it   73.69897803619884
but first let haydée be informed that i have returned   74.7446611496438
monsieur d artagnan   157.5897551330184
do as you think best d artagnan   225.92162668641
but who is to carry the letter to tours and who to london   162.27944912709594
villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off   104.5482682345702
d artagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase   108.57847056343209
let me look at you   94.30230824462267
there on turning round d artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared   59.210326509936934
splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt and lace fell also over the top of his boots   131.11482496650143
he will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs   9.493531032271221
now listen to me maximilian   165.76576154988123
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness   129.99529336316988
hush   150.1708346465307
athos s horse where is that   52.37092735208793
i will take it in the turkish style replied franz   81.34715209028403
danglars of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese   11.52221664549323
they went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counter as their friends must have done before them   171.1932631431129
and i will say that you are the sextus   288.66620550028017
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table   27.243700838618693
you and i alone know of its existence   212.14082824149324

la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window   56.6794080742262
then add that his grace has in the precipitation with which he quit the isle of ré forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from madame de chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen inasmuch as it proves not only that her majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of france   133.33997776644154
while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy   120.48611838292486
edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along   63.08001586952347
alas   164.64364312416285
planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by rochefort s servant   118.31567814338652
the count placed himself between caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat   57.80310530109645
porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony to night about crushing an adder   91.17747043881278
for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena he who is about to die salutes you   119.68107467616713
germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty musketeers   100.63670547475016
caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly pale   177.0452294945368
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each other s prudence   170.3365639526155
all this appears to be a little mysterious   155.61250251833377
yes said porthos   151.90586161017018
well renew these bills up to the 5th of september   105.29237683290718
and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there   79.02738673406841
but above all things i am a marvel to you   79.12259128141912
yes   165.77823956525003

raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories   63.99721093988657
that prohibition is not for me said d artagnan   191.19958151132516

still marquise it has been so with other usurpers cromwell for instance who was not half so bad as napoleon had his partisans and advocates   94.03890214547492
he was alone   152.69803464485727
do you still wish to do so   115.44869045214575
bonacieux came in   41.471403361839094
thirty crowns   134.64493552334721
the whole body of servants arranged in a semi circle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity   138.2902257441465
but i will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to marseilles you will seek out a young girl named mercédès at the catalans and give her two lines from me   124.91890120276948
the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead   119.26832815950347
i don t know   75.20183902527914
anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings   46.24280758033177
we went out   94.64673027411786
when everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop made and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish in order to select the finest specimen among them he looked around for his piece of glass   244.2477566811402
a sacerdotal officer   31.677567891673334
what   96.5609191134955
my dear athos said aramis you speak like nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the greeks   132.08599740649635
then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said i have an enemy   39.43699207856956
his shadow did the same   117.77456113924985

30123m so sir you lived at lucca did you   30.46616492982065
said porthos   171.27314723844887
athos did not lose sight of the two speakers   190.86630301582187
but as she left the apartment julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features   189.79324961184608
grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint méran   82.58177306876192
athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow   217.51787966580338
morrel groaned   138.75143136500822
my wife must have committed some frightful crime   49.48868889733174
de la trémouille a protestant and seeing the king seldom was of no party he did not in general carry any bias into his social relations   128.28028699777212
franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him   141.27382469213703
yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it   150.2426299737819
d avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away   168.7710901776715
said tréville with a brow flushed with anger   18.931647732790452
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face   129.21493400500776
he gave me this paper   151.79649777447955
said porthos   147.3387640242468
why do you mention my father   140.66703212509796
hush   153.9689939053245
the young king looked at the officer with his large formed eye and repeated monsieur d artagnan   208.23974664277983
that s my advice   76.20511999650857
finally he promised that he would leave her mistress s presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid   55.72335786673476
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale   89.90491523771746
one can say anything to me   130.5675802755251
meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter   113.94588699846739
ah my poor friend   123.35177373560376
you   163.4770043176842

he made a great start and looked at me   109.1547925891396
hush   59.43517669054614
at least so my cashier tells me   35.19705292907011
he cursed the instant when m   146.23545184119558
oh no edmond it is myself that i blame myself that i hate   99.26672114504616
what is it   57.240848937778345

the first prince of the blood the king s uncle   135.95745849739404
bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon   128.3846490133682
his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy   33.00071686347454
well said caderousse i should have sworn that he turned to the right how treacherous wine is   157.35662758299924
this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach and felt it   144.8260854687758
and he began to laugh loudly but nervously   140.69272295758876
nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream   95.69826247274204
unfortunately they are well mounted   110.04279315203993
and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm   126.6037480650042
here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pine torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above   53.792351621631134
you must go then mademoiselle said emmanuel   77.9298502666243
30115m and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars said albert laughing   188.98219729110718
remember that his name is all my secret   97.61398464270489
no   122.0432791926109
cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree   136.63716298056968
behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden   138.73907092211698
but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes i will ruin the queen   131.5060009020224
but you madame you appear to be free continued the novice   234.94788858210163
remember your promise   221.86252999096797
my safety is now a mere question of speed   54.15961840583155

and how does it concern me what you have learned   177.26949263304041
the travelers replied   148.1056728248393
raoul turned toward athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go   103.89543144862003
noirtier let his head fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful   87.98056145031181
one may forsake a mistress but a wife good heavens   199.5894319000119

d artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal s letter it was however merely a letter of introduction   277.75343810903826
extremely   98.42758294558715
said the stranger   126.26006473030428
but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messenger s departure   41.75113770679825

almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith   25.573044587246017

how a gardener may get rid of the dormice chapter 62   65.08747097090097
only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile   160.79586148022452
most likely said d artagnan   202.06952296486787

monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers   248.36921717450986
had the old man s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there   46.63916987618623
de winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes   139.49579572908948
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows   87.60647262093369
i say since you command me mercédès i must die   25.841956786480367
to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them   21.30931951971634
repeated mousqueton   91.20096619836441

a summer and winter palace   175.92959451754447

my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other s failings   108.46900180320942
he had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account   127.55298886357875
athos made no reply   34.83042343002401
there in the salon   205.49273273710835
porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post   144.37886761959084
vampa then removed the stone and cucumetto came out   42.54533472600825

your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight   91.89990606330451
it was on thursday the abbé s reception day   123.76907026280534

in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel   110.03868075790953
continued he   25.542101437412924

and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life   83.20734967428032
nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse   95.65074386038373

milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the count s   40.68443123120585
oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed   67.38705551422797
the person to whom you were conducted yesterday   120.69722090078001
emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel   103.44540276127341
de tréville   198.95311627258877
so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me i shall marry the widow   146.5444543386089
we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin   87.00669215611688
as to king charles the question must be viewed differently   120.59621768156182
yes sir   244.01491155305695
he who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal   79.5172724019939
toward two o clock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door   258.0399247832281
to me to you to us   185.00719016088053
you know i always did call you my child   39.70442431159566
but if they fire all is lost   135.80060533706654
0193m who talks of god and despair at the same time   113.77524782891393
i have come for nothing else but to tell you so   254.8827404331434
oh yes monsieur   36.92762630637411
by the side of andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence and who had been appointed by the court for andrea disdained to pay any attention to those details to which he appeared to attach no importance   68.86090785610781
the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within them   90.93855574802062
ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery   61.99937514358368
she is amiable and well behaved   145.7632478257958
said the sentry you may now go on   73.06604496123406
directly   94.08014155071871
said the gascon   177.00576520288035
the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel   60.57851032590622
they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm   93.57330994531974
asked the one who carried the lantern   55.0971994024443
a gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by step this is uncommon   211.78376096840972
the will was never wanting   103.1600491545674
i do not like anyone to deny his origin   100.14250201079935
and do you command nothing in your own name   35.6068712574903
did she return home   109.09708140388976
30297m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count   95.95521802804723
which   83.0920427505965
beware of what you are about gentlemen   134.04217797354275
old woman   175.3061677648629
cried raoul   162.60282753179308
but m   39.514592182913745
said danglars   6.744911981833582
cried all the guests simultaneously   151.8513764831933
you did well   186.77671202257332
yes said grimaud   180.43424233733802
my friend said beauchamp in the most affectionate tone i should gladly make an apology   135.15939926940953
i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at rome i who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence   105.23372223294048
is treated at the court of france   166.59063123049003
the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome   177.69546504278395
a woman accompanied by a servant   134.4265447125627
did you tell him your whole story   205.23690525654834
but while d artagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table   109.42400585483983
if valentine is not now dead she will not die   40.240440600887965
the sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his eyes   123.03492485654347
give him alms bazin and bid him pray for a poor sinner   17.346943742081976
let us fly   233.33834092106622
a carriage awaited him at the door   160.13814341953127
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into france   127.12204323758017
the sergeant made a sign of comprehension   133.25879900040104
but what cared i for delays or difficulties valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me   112.16787038828409
besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others   92.6349179585398
thank you i have just returned from sea   179.49677432786305
by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba   108.20546585783562
yes yes that was her name   56.320798934685065
eat heartily   8.948741595679508
did she afterward return   215.12593895765872
the young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution   82.21914992285545
the quarters of the king were sometimes at estrée sometimes at jarrie   186.95847282314233
i broke my word it is true   97.06359236169745
oh d artagnan   167.360564181179
he knows you better by your actions than your name   118.43024418679424
this verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer   173.26139536651135
porthos was delighted   27.30662502249865
the watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinalists   126.60953048718666
for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly   43.18958471585944
he found tréville in a joyful mood   42.60682318325716
agreed   118.76362107974691
the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which d artagnan occupied with authority   38.52338254191703
said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips   75.69691932318587
well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said beauchamp   173.15144864488238
come   59.678878325815326
i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk   98.8356694115376
how is that   125.55823420291202
so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains   60.642903112421784
laugh if you will   87.32650096086812
yes i paid them nothing and yet they are gone   81.8666172123886
we must confess these three strange names struck us   17.280363614137002
would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him   179.24010251435487
and what may it be   97.15873940438246
if you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains out   100.53775432761658
gone said morrel   182.82777453367652
happily i am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing   197.2937328804345
they were waiting at the entrance of the rue sainte catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade   128.76941596723256
the poor girl originally possessed much more than that   108.88221096865249
have you any letters for me   91.66072118110667
well i will tell you what i did not like to mention on my return from yanina   70.63415650571366
you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind   83.57888139812309
the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that   112.52812282981772
but where are you really going   53.72976102159789
suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space   12.91832701571495
they asked together   105.12727178181805
but what   68.47804077073842
yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny   72.05857210481
i recognize monsieur de flamarens   111.03157785055453
gutenberg   3.0895897394317586
he may desire to become my heir and re   98.79543923197072
oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me   162.55906554724658
not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once   66.11329604533543
since i set my foot in france and knew the traitor lived in paris i have watched carefully   193.43593817804663
when i am dead you will go and examine it   208.62727888097652
can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted   90.58345526875023
morcerf   41.9962826764735
vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion   156.10095005078563
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to d artagnan s chair   143.5594960277797
on the contrary you will give me great pleasure   80.04452400775537
i will have ten   114.7682115162693
athos rose walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step embraced him tenderly and as he burst into violent sobs he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice friend be a man   91.13468604846466
i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms   93.95561327733526
cried the procurator s wife   213.01551355007294
ah monsieur hypocrite i understand how you study theology   52.735005180721146
de villefort monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to m   89.89962398306255
only at what hour was he with you   117.37565444788981
take care athos   55.4366162240736
porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a dancer   206.1314240727429
i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you i can scarcely stand   186.6994866812037
but remember ah   183.67378078794408
the queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer perhaps you like repose   93.14263518398683
said d artagnan embarrassed   223.4982827104695
asked athos   180.7817526418422
carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him   62.32632554028908
he had now leisure to look to his wound   94.43308636996483
with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over   36.704250732259084
said mordaunt with a sneer there s one who is afraid   158.3012568757986
and for fear no doubt that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world bazin had laid his hands upon sword pistols plumed hat and embroideries and laces of all kinds and sorts   117.8558539325255
we must play the game to the end and consent to be blindfolded   197.91436885810856
go   114.61772778677353
go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister de longueville that i thank her for the present that she made me of you   100.61073118473684
i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans   82.38003032533123
at last as i seemed to cling to life i was ordered to the south   194.5038773718799
ah monsieur it is silence   124.8752912948691
do not alarm yourself sir   216.62849516991156
at about a league and a half from the city d artagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing time   153.43174215664155
and i have none either said the queen   138.5659128709886
there   74.59684417322602
it is desirable i should know the real cause   42.434164813480905
a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracy a storm which menaces no less than your majesty s throne   122.90824374592498
the executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his bed   117.99421678503045
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post   154.57561327061228
the departure for belgium chapter 98   29.2538668871871
i am not mistaken   109.80519627724465
reassure yourself   52.970237791063056
ah   73.25435247061809
i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done   95.16837222317616
you will restore me to life   130.10166274304603
if it were nothing but a sword thrust why then i have counted upon you on this occasion monsieur   81.02056621288409
she is not the less guilty monsieur duke   141.3596765013051
but d artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that   40.207121615927235
asked another   126.8003097349613
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind d artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice   33.760645463948066
that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness   166.53179760007527
where is your master   34.84242719554929
mr   225.60136161318894
the judges themselves appeared to be stupefied and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion   93.37255910301587
but at all events listen well to this   260.2008753649138
good   104.0072733205013
i understand that but i do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner   130.84602759214624
a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh   151.87396698759414
full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked good extended his affection even to his judge spite of villefort s severe look and stern accent   172.1127473622153
cried franz   163.79966539476175
yes appearances were against me and i was about to suffer dishonor   143.83439860290085
they passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers   53.20587124902131
ah   68.46214188603822
this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange   176.3587454205862
porthos   68.70451612163583
i understand   86.20945364548831
several times even i felt a smile on my lips   163.77223782068336
but a mother has twofold sight   37.176535253505804
now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry   153.51613722641488
you are very fastidious said athos   78.84290462924008
by the way i have received news of franz   120.62525039906974
whether it belongs to you or another you may perhaps stand in need of it   160.52219560165992
and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair   253.0912173520114
remember it is you who have ruined me   170.18466736395413
it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty years of age dressed in a tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers   136.63987174140047
oh you do not know what is seventeen months in prison   184.16628278861305
i know that sir   84.30704194671961
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner   22.651967395552617
but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome   61.73109955122969
after the king and the cardinal m   128.78769962777415
cloud   46.67495850425151
one of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance   160.88250970046175
drink and relate then   216.17173907183033
your relative left la rochelle for england during the night   55.318491532698346
ah said the priest in a marked italian accent   163.05197576343588
you   146.1025223398882
asked dantès who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm   88.4012241857055
in hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host   153.89127109610718
and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution   173.670057454644
the devil   183.59258631571123
or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by signs   17.585446538060836
of roman crowns in the most distant a   142.72183267936688
certainly   94.21882315636448
she told d artagnan that lord de winter was her brother in law and not her brother   55.33711385631089
and both again left the room   180.29484670555152
tell them said morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that i am her betrothed   95.45053416899263
let us separate and let us seek the mercer s wife that is the key of the intrigue   181.72045904816645
and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow   241.09843519117464
oh if that were so i should lose my reason   70.1808426166765
a keeper replied grimaud   130.0675508106728
what the devil makes him glower thus behind him   14.20837440688905
he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold   192.92370728639952
i do   59.610997720890396
as we said before by ten o clock almost all the guests had dispersed   152.62814014697193
her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious   133.5731506322876
that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not know   66.51064381993098
d artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms   119.30753153247672
d avrigny returned with his associate   63.015695420842235
what do you mean to do with that purse   137.21343705267105
it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty   97.14392252859356
then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk   61.67165472855412
but let me be properly acquainted with the subject   63.695551863287015
yes my lord   165.89470908785248
how miserable not to be free   124.4964422407489
nothing and he read you have not answered my first note   63.576391856307104
that there should be a famine   57.864008063762526
oh   132.91780180424303
thank you said monte cristo   46.67456909570785
i want all my household at auteuil   203.6759086589525
why so   146.66008748098224
then let them explain themselves   125.55090976651476
and who charges me with this monseigneur   48.11773518977857
madame danglars was rooted to the spot   87.47430982948933
bertuccio lay covers for three   125.7007134983708
i am a priest said the young man   72.11103517841264
then turning to aramis he said it is now your turn monsieur le chevalier   73.08591302534649
you have two or three times mentioned a m   58.961680147902754
yes   112.34814115880553
thanks my brave lover   210.2743490123014
yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise i can not answer as to what i may do myself   151.5468853326601
i knew his father m   184.4470165602991
then turning to the prisoner what is it you want   8.57331006146238
demanded debray   65.93852851372469
no   173.8687253844059
monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory   138.62033781833466
in what way converted   133.54106413893857
yes first and then to go to paris   108.62728777504444
so much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his suspicions   151.0593814326204
besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of athos   201.98811676879532
monsieur mousqueton   120.05251857935207
may heaven prosper you   15.745376463023291
let her do what she likes with the duke   123.14603174520248
said the major half aloud   176.3345769214685
she cried   100.37910343643486
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room   43.743223574535875
thou mayst add that thou hast risked it planchet   51.08045134899996
nevertheless do not believe that it is madame de longueville with whom i am in love   150.9738495352689
replied athos smiling   48.02677200082725
the duchess shook her head   86.60637455598132
that will be fifty fowls at 100 000 francs apiece and half a fowl for the 50 000   243.69622245564625
no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence   174.47402572262334
the light had almost disappeared from the former   72.258410338539
athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful   51.98464691883734
a joyous smile lighted porthos s face   154.41169222432083
i live as it were between two graves   61.40140552696543
i have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds mine   265.5504814049913
said the abbé in a peculiar tone he is happy   126.24054283215162
no   133.05357016496978
it is worth fifty thousand francs and i repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness   186.35991525060018
by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her   134.8158514379933
noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort   39.699882553986384
how was such a thing possible   106.75045503836198
and he was obliged to confess to himself to the shame of the procurator s wife and his own regret that he did not see that fire that animation that bustle which when a good repast is on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living   228.08771307008934
the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected   54.812131454214786
and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him   236.2926979262362
but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night before   136.90945797944642
asked the count surprised   221.55341659749263
how he stares at him the insolent dog   192.41074000118851
yes when the house where he fraternizes is suspected   80.27349855730802
here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man   88.80051101407702
but the wine said d artagnan who furnishes the wine   219.43561555261402
fernand became deadly pale   134.52204603462445
or sully louis xiii   76.43679336222971
where are you   43.34994256850446
i was going to make you the offer my dear d artagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle   104.59098684946055
i confess it but pardon to every sin   123.44861577169239
fifty vessels were waiting to set out   99.43076332331972
oh nothing worth speaking of said morrel   40.183837495649755
my lord de winter continued athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman   63.03488199384186
it was thought reliance might be placed in general quesnel   167.6956227211325
here i am said vampa instantly appearing   22.87540650698918
monsieur de bouillon had the gout but notwithstanding his illness which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last month that is since paris had been besieged he was ready to receive the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay   111.84978448439848
it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime   92.06649165331919
if you were to die i should die too   141.0417155806386
but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage   126.36986432584389
go i tell you   148.10862724423998
he resides in a quiet quarter continued aramis   55.45634773391318
he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment   247.36922796116363
once within the interior of the court the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty five steps   162.16452461022368
what rival   112.14300942635717
what is it you edmond back again   87.53799870328767
say albert my friend do you wish it   143.25955423715834
dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices   139.61846514479322
but he could look and with that look ask assistance   128.08756078372343
then my dear mother said albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber   71.98793753374787
mazarin shook his head   193.22073505166878
the three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question them   184.1907382680045
i now believe in italian banditti   119.88511072721634
you are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out   276.1051991946165
he has already proved himself full of resources   86.4787436901996
repassed the bidassoa   93.49110730201525
had madame de saint méran any enemies   173.8372815807279
chrysostom kicking about famously the sheets of the thesis which had fallen on the floor   163.93372644823575
the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag   102.9558136513959
you watch while i sleep and you have come to bring me some news   233.41468458897762
do you not comprehend   19.430829948927624
why that i may be dangerously wounded killed even   123.32570481254471
oh fear nothing madame   51.67511215788059
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm   182.9193077652462
president but in its turn   91.00043661033884
another sign in the negative   77.64666858743234
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first   133.11287280020318
what is his name   22.916195182146424
i believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain   142.76311265969716
oh said danglars i can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice   131.64810836474112
who knows when i shall be at liberty that i may not satisfy your curiosity   193.84120896165507
yes indeed said he i believe so   161.49308624046233
m   201.08757027552733
how very singular cried monte cristo with well feigned astonishment   85.26057116179358
you do not know the italian nobility   93.37587864717477
indeed sir said he to albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the case to the king s attorney   106.3462385989958
a certain d artagnan a béarnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to london   68.40551193871464
stop said he i have an idea   90.13885290090855
yes caderousse you have seen me   130.0768468676001
i was present during his last moments   68.24069666557548
20167m as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year   89.41694943803313
m   158.768852871008
a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought after   27.203682320381603
dantès was about to speak   87.63344634574369
no no look look   90.93665479931511
oh you love her still said kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young man s countenance for an instant   187.21704970521685
it is true i fought with tolerable success   228.78935845264542
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced   119.63230577750141
porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income   99.64004259135066
in the first place said milady it is possible i may be deceived and that d artagnan and his friends may really come to your assistance   144.383879915927
cavalcanti   153.7087998386929
that of napoleon on the column of the place vendôme   204.89695601202118
perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons   141.18569505096877
bonacieux   127.5518438598037
the felucca is mined said d artagnan   76.9610322150222
ah   153.8263096608303
the hapless dantès was doomed   138.37247662564846
on   153.05413331571032
don t waste a charge   112.59403849061987
at this moment the clock of la samaritaine struck six   261.95872536221407
by whom then were we beaten   83.2249832396407
which means   4.287885057823402
it is possible   74.75277558091662
certainly   105.77846550873619
well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object   186.01225089438316
mute as a carp   53.981211792510265
only to make a woman of thirty nine look like a woman of fifty   94.60356983525945
we loved sporting of all kinds better than anything   82.56598609708043
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle   168.81320872836434
chapter xii   135.01203502183287
ah you fancy so   97.36840352256434
an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel   196.3124684392776
aramis instantly seized and read it   169.21670551871156
de saint méran s   236.24561741353435
are these persons then so rich and powerful   112.59527421330796
the fiery spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply   157.16239272160306
fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on one side in the corso and on the other in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the hôtel de londres   203.7780481913572
and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was justified   78.09066942302678
who   133.66244737880115
who was he   71.72739817738395
and then dantès countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies   121.49603709063504
the horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him   76.90343285205947
speak speak   171.44648692141448
ah ah   261.2159009510498
the recompense will exceed your expectations   140.55534653653584
very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers   234.21572325064216
they will believe he is arrested and that will give him time   118.29903496115153
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards valentine and for the first time noticed the white lips   147.43118899467302
is there a convent at noisy   10.354032834961998
yes yes replied mazarin   184.00620017444302
murmured valentine   34.04124267603933
said the abbé   191.85274831563586
for heaven s sake not a word of this before him   91.95077670589527
in that case monseigneur do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife   194.85721208685464
without a doubt he must   28.088209474831316
we shall see better what is going on   104.0040741069257
for like all galley slaves you said i may escape from prison i can not from the grave   146.81545782245496
and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor   27.23880133620881
ah maternal love is a great virtue a powerful motive so powerful that it excuses a multitude of things even if after duncan s death lady macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience   109.43220034553396
inquired the king   73.50456399823968
no albert take my advice   100.47573663195054
impossible   27.575890597190707
sir unless you force me i think i can effectually force you   31.999313668287897
and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth my father and mercédès   119.93562664703722
so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you   175.33425030381034
in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse   156.6125867351431
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same   10.63165586988275
then also as athos had predicted it became possible to find mme   37.71805932018664
there was a postscript i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent   173.73329787225745
i have known you four days   32.89829743454207
therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves   141.17982105510958
the sailors did not wait for a second invitation   149.39085132971903
murder   72.76821296878106
he pushed back his bed and waited for day   27.42545026114007
mounting on the breach with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other he said bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers who astonished at this apparition stopped fifty paces from the bastion gentlemen a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion   152.78304856616523
i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois   121.69958647933566
they reached the rue st   76.18844846609952
asked d artagnan   45.20629690658271
morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might   242.2063826168513
will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject   114.87715573317475
oh he was not a gentleman i ll answer for it   88.14522999969151
cried d artagnan you were all in the plot then   143.90390981726998
a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been disciplined   202.34321527159898
pooh   83.48809544253572
oh   156.4032239041671
and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs   124.79998825285224
to tell you that you are free your excellency   135.4798948919763
i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day   101.88598249252692
but it has none   130.9888239371689
but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage   74.28643459877986
it will then be said of me that i died for the king   83.98903895029058
no on the contrary they wished to assassinate him   193.21767574956147
but however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her investigation   159.71576478942592
i said danglars have always intended giving my daughter 500 000 francs as her dowry   228.81543918127798
in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants   95.93830710525062
a totally different subject interests me   140.80532472174266
i was there this very day   182.70961548719893
said monte cristo   182.75242114534157
ah ha ha   92.27803543629855
see the fatal example on the vendomois road d artagnan you so brave and you porthos so valiant and so strong you were beaten   137.57471992369832
de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume   248.9444365646853
danglars lost five hundred thousand francs   154.397648396381
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm   162.73794913510434
run and seek athos porthos and aramis   144.25435665718703
first and foremost dear d artagnan we have no title such as count here   166.5657572419892
madame de chevreuse was not queen murmured anne of austria overcome in spite of herself by the expression of so profound a passion   195.4249080796377
if you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it   123.3354656688267
asked i of my mother   97.43654553475805
because i imagine you have correspondents in that country   113.92861875170041
help   26.45830221954887
raoul at the same time seized one of the young man s hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man   91.5481287212093
yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress   202.85010548492943
baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment   203.88562905418587
i have that of the garter which king charles i   169.73875952200876
and if i defend myself or call or cry out   103.02752858864689
blood and anger mounted to his face   43.56917459442194
you are mistaken   235.90057069550312
the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motionless   161.2466337276363
it goes without saying that when he saw a huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion   104.47915547327506
but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house   90.49229429211653
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant   83.83751583363548
one by the post madame danglars footman left the other   222.8652101655095
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart   27.210145991241376
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of d artagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits   229.89877916240403
the world still speaks within you in a loud voice altisimâ voce   151.05698357319795
perhaps he knows you though you do not know him   75.59481013589769
oh i can t let you go so   106.60817475342385
when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of alexander s feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother   91.14409087496503
asked aramis   175.6795749967614
sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome   15.568504481541154
yes   112.30531792554854
yet i am sure she is not happy said caderousse   64.64099182339783
he then inquired how they had fared in their trip   96.84738522432738
chapter 41   68.00836275283339
well   109.78001604640913
and from there if it please god to france where at least i understand the architecture of the houses   24.175829787246002
be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies   91.04970497365875
it was given to you by that veiled lady i met you with the other sunday near the gate st   164.98041767495062
the three companions advanced rather humbly for all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves leaving athos the post of speaker   162.48749006547112
madame de saint méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to her   257.1480581755156
after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle field the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself   183.0996344599726
i speak of the adventure eh you know well what i mean   195.40521042753596
were you stopped   207.81185834263928
stop but it is very strange oh my god my head swims   157.47777436974928
chapter lxxv   74.53021577477324
and i desist from my pretensions said aramis   165.97038642439085
i place no confidence in their hypocritical faces   29.527453618276326
i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something   24.138397022413656
you may guess finding the luck turned that i again staked the diamond   20.884059362696775
do not fancy that i do you a favor   137.7142319351877
i have then to inform you sir at the request of m   42.045524063894476
d artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket here my friend write your name upon it and become my chief   136.68497776132716
their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately   76.00549498520641
the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting   43.67669868143537
my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me   168.85931245391416
how could that be monsieur   145.1567148927188
cried morrel   40.23614176826278
cried d artagnan without a thesis   75.5232721090288
no   98.53675209398682
they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood   145.7295125396644
the abbé s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonaparte s emissaries one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 a very resolute and very dangerous man   128.5766724445647
d artagnan nodded his head and bazin retired after placing on the table the spanish wine   190.0019827114305
asked de winter turning around   96.96750989873678
however they left the castle behind   66.26684008916168
athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him   201.5598795209953
pity   113.31261276116297
charmingly as you see   49.835747208649025
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me   32.38976178192442
if he be killed it will be another s turn and so on provided a single one arrives that is all that is required   23.251438444195855
said d artagnan   142.56091147980425
i don t like comments   126.5067496480068
cried athos suddenly where have you brought us   253.36230097733971
yes i know you are a man of a stout heart monsieur said the cardinal with a voice almost affectionate   200.1312405317778
said albert with a thundering voice   186.81328639045768
the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous   63.64090490627698
and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated   96.9994807538639
monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds   140.35000893354692
well   185.5320266966495
the ballet of la merlaison chapter xxiii   126.62152409795323
oh my god   63.70980674961382
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience   143.701975264908
however promise me one thing   197.0103179834317
this winding sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight before   231.54772492547443
50170m oh pardon me sir   28.429543202324922
it is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it   98.16628715250656
yours your own property   67.13079120492247
tell him further that i hold montague in my power   142.38146017724463
hold if that should happen although i am a christian m   61.420910898426584
porthos you are as vain as narcissus   141.82742356186185
in the name of heaven cried dantès speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me   172.8193880390245
ah very good   15.20992907981254
asked mazarin   95.96507454415833
it was mercédès who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after him   60.59285910754457
then you pity me   152.81492333423878
madame replied de winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you   262.6102880796817
asked mazarin anxiously   203.52593595893836
d avrigny with a slow and solemn tone if anyone falls ill in your house if you feel yourself attacked do not send for me for i will come no more   136.20967689035567
salite   82.79762503967228
to troyes in champagne i answered   173.74985625317998
grimaud meantime undid the means of escape   94.19722001762986
the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first   106.85567350907014
she already heard morrel s voice when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes her stiffened foot missed the step her hands had no power to hold the baluster and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor   225.21213292345374
nonsense said d artagnan   213.73183721062378
then the cardinal added a propos sire do not forget to tell her majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her diamond studs become her   38.082581945796136
what are you going to do this evening   33.252747022949904
but you aramis who were close to him   46.33587868811016
asked d artagnan   146.82296779441634
thank you sir said d avrigny   155.7774345541415
so you are here   41.11144375977034
adieu sir she said   175.9015407615441
dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship pharaon   265.9374096466762
you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night   107.89308901942138
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite   63.051666995511155
who will give it to you your prince   69.53184244093205
monsieur bertuccio chapter 43   74.78190342060756
selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered   157.91580288777254
then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty   183.87197988499472
dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade   163.39773741206352
exclaimed a voice from behind the trees   114.48640585760346
but whether it be for recompense or punishment i accept my fate   64.91763752528819
and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance   143.15615252864194
and you who have seen the whole world will relate your adventures you shall tell us the history of the beautiful greek who was with you the other night at the opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess   135.33348235339827
on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure   100.37890127851696
go to blin or véronique for your clothes   135.24888154939364
the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly go on   83.86589198631111
can he have and she stopped   6.1956101057268285
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead   149.2071895955168
you love me madame   177.94239884423123
the devil   128.37461239770533
said the light horseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds   111.19504568272868
by order of cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it   100.10525037674374
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up   133.6857043277809
everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently   80.37763103525552
is there a secret spring   151.20482937990732
yes said d artagnan athos is right it must be burned   253.47400982766553
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight   117.36003744973569
but that is not all   127.73492754915337
the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth   117.34050300956096
one of them hat in hand said to him would you believe it monsieur   168.99128936588534
no   99.79919458108873
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled   55.47342367144382
and how have i broken that treaty your excellency   56.65456626102233
not at all   148.16740250476786
the other   155.29332627566967
hear the end   92.59791312986253
i received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact i rendered him   88.05426341524847
a slight shade passed over the brow of bonacieux but so slight that d artagnan did not perceive it   84.15444336118563
the next morning king charles i   132.1858356365422
simpleton   121.16750436051785
i don t know yet   58.527035041824035
this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural   88.10149092338216
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls   102.00715637883987
never despair of anything says the proverb   128.3011064171075
a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him   131.64302908175523
beauchamp availed himself of albert s permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before eight   189.91354690773176
the queen   261.95125217659955
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine   157.466111950534
we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farm that is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention   75.6284216284136
instead of fighting for cromwell we have served charles i   191.66546850613042
but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes   81.43745375048255
your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it   182.72194768818446
the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus   181.0100514512791
the devil he does   36.18204899690775
coquenard did not seem to observe it   34.1553885344633
yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak   118.59557848653506
i rest   59.7620755102071
the friend of madame de villefort   76.92515031810726
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him   93.8995979692004
said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine   144.89628820168463
villefort started with joy   183.51635929904432
during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern   89.60725248794375
yes signified the old man   249.37382976102663
the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world   154.26313789794867
let it pass   203.6629049026202
then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed   143.36109088131826
it is true the queen is for him   135.87105507631787
inquired aramis   168.32988717513263
well a fowl fish game it signifies little so that i eat   101.13366370909652
asked the poor woman have i said anything that has wounded you   144.52225146728614
bazin has read history gentlemen he knows that sixtus the fifth became pope after having kept pigs   171.42497231152637
but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin   130.4265223220985
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent   210.4439287235199
this method was so simple that d artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively   111.85838968630331
my dear mr   120.15487183828796
never mind said the coadjutor   204.52683346695088
not one has therefore to reproach himself   80.9547104389018
let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by it   87.50879006556679
d artagnan was beside himself with joy   91.24016736361664
and you appear satisfied with the explanation   53.76140057899849
but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish   167.59228705164688
besides i am the person punished as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis at least   204.60040671304012
bonacieux and was expressed in these terms there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you   122.3465961049578
cavalcanti   133.76669755092087
i can show you answered the gascon   114.45812056995331
besides he had the cardinal s hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word   116.53918014142587
it matters little now to me   48.31092686673301
tell me quickly   150.95229571814488
the boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent   151.02471577206714
do you call that nourishment   169.4562602673311
barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend   106.98367841801642
yes   135.75189288600987
and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three o clock and that i request permission to introduce someone to her   232.72801824008576
and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king   123.12083653938176
aramis came behind giving his arm to porthos   88.26432053920777
and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl   169.94865570432464
i have already told you avenge him   23.135537998279943
d artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis   111.32481773792163
i will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our conversation   175.97805305064654
in 1829 who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor   134.2184315306958
would it be impertinent signor sinbad said franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness   74.23447561468707
we want to ask something else of you   161.2154853168522
see   84.35223799395555
yes   137.09707094384223
yet she remained impassive looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth   63.950939323357176
we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again   110.03101193864991
you are right sir replied the governor   178.6058691163553
idiot that i am though i have been trying to find it out for five years i never found it out   175.1974554277739
why did you not accept it   65.26114790404966
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires   83.38062697914518
said he   104.32306886959282
perhaps there are four said d artagnan   14.578310082593589
that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o clock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals   90.97720288449152
let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali will bring us coffee and pipes   124.54220308530994
well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him twice   66.21805752410256
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now   90.03944507007171
the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers   150.21620284326607
that is a long time   157.73052677008548
cried he   105.25137348549005
beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph   54.9751490203773
i have but little influence now but all that i have shall most assuredly be his   152.49256912806737
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo   137.87172127080046
but to what do you attribute this conduct   216.9225987925219
is he prosperous and happy   137.5707319447681
it appeared then to d artagnan that m   96.32779934813738
mazarin was a cheat at the card table   220.0026361267066
for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then i should have been free   131.53418173347637
we will dine directly my friend   114.90333714909389
without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did not raise the alarm   101.1050858304172
in the meanwhile i am a musketeer   43.52378607578038
therefore in spite of olivain s remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him   68.15891434271958
i am not called louis the just without reason   183.25512015964685
your agreeable company will divert me   164.5645833329326
de villefort of the impertinence of his servants   177.06205665214094
besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything   125.86180087061031
two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done   19.201652534804964
but this planchet is so serious and important that i have not informed my friends that i would entrust this secret to you   219.2154337076655
it is the hotel rambouillet cried guitant   115.5029734162971
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf   104.98382934887252
chapter xxxvi   80.1634125078358
your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead   142.81189362491835
justice before everything   50.86904004585875
and he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her   132.2992638432912
bonacieux   99.1478359904689
long live the duc de beaufort   116.83076538765917
the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation   139.73026417755784
no embellishments no embroidery no arabesques   99.85729312726984
oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances   34.794343230148755
said morrel sadly   127.53400447386139
if i should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route   124.54203316671057
it is impossible that your majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my brother   159.75584634508402
stuff   169.81983187374442
what for   150.12902742847277
stop a moment cried d artagnan   65.14262104345221
i had better get on horseback and go and meet her   140.9714114271263
putting on his cloak and gloves   140.51506876193216
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism   95.9712852439222
what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup   121.74694431365747
so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count   150.40295683072378
there is your money half in bank notes the other half in checks payable to bearer   83.20431793138025
what inconvenience can it be   152.8979612145376
rothschild   118.84629649867513
and why so   23.452551930927044
that we may be more at our ease la ramee removes the guards keeping only grimaud to wait on us   186.05648814742966
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor   184.18333602472057
you know the interest we both take in this poor little madame bonacieux   155.31607351852688
and for myself i assure you i could not sleep either for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast   9.607670404878078
willingly monseigneur said the executioner   8.59094926057
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after   114.61423246272041
besides it doesn t concern me   174.34430509454552
in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment   131.3713242934477
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness   14.647509019143797
ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything   109.87729548950216
will you give me a lesson the day after to morrow   115.83831014863976
and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10 000 francs will you have your supper with us   164.2079421760543
the very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the count s carriage   85.99508655804557
he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate   168.10870198325017
and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying   80.88682200705523
and don t forget said d artagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two english gentlemen   209.89475276239932
for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven   136.70008206667484
the shade of cardinal richelieu   113.73939537266894
45   162.64856665835936
grimaud   157.78136607350535
employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads   202.05879880278093
porthos opened his mouth to reply   64.53547851491534
among these two hundred levees that of tréville was one of the most sought   197.61380679083055
let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their course   126.100328903206
and what is more however the man speaks for himself my preserver   106.98781240817175
at the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning   27.70514098078621
within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly   41.39345684709252
we still remain four friends devoted to each other   83.69284790584723
and what is your reason for advising me to go alone   66.62908136638538
from that glass door the pale faced man went to the count s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard   143.94346844639506
locusta valentine was alone   120.43660210620777
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped   158.2152880908157
i protest my dear la ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that i would stay forever at vincennes to have the pleasure of your society   102.1747652089112
i think you re right answered he we shall have a gale   54.899414291085286
a plague on t   17.28159783791564
i wish after such a scene to be alone   219.22350996664312
this however doesn t concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me   243.80947284220093
once pale he was now yellow   89.5048597740055
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening   142.69098521511836
you asked the name of that young lady   162.3616862790592
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart   113.50132954045303
indeed   160.36904116882488
morrel said not a word   125.3898902973116
the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy   145.6552305822365
de villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear me   109.48577279367484
this is the way in which you northerns understand chemistry madame   102.53319026687863
your punctuality really alarms me   230.2578706761625
villefort perceiving the abbé passed his hand across his brow   151.07921005670806
oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting   269.44027447562405
monsieur de chavigny where was he   101.28734807440851
besides the woman wore that black mantle which d artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe   219.39279034503238
then a fearful crash was heard   45.65390271082582
monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it   75.16478124717362
albert listened with the most profound attention   202.0216976599008
anne of austria at the age of forty six   70.57337767999006
she would tell me nothing and i departed   250.79617548986693
chevalier said d artagnan laughing you could eat a piece of mouston couldn t you especially after two or three days of fasting   83.99901981786533
then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids   205.987690956559
it is quite true   91.99177575536447
or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her   21.44298083440708
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me   65.13970962461065
rejoined mazarin impatiently it s about an hour since i asked you for that very thing wooden head that you are   96.83202807578911
the valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without reply   72.71475538456008
no replied d artagnan no noise   110.03498637031407
a   62.34711337882655
andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door   147.2375076219044
morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us   116.29784382662021
come come do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the corsican who to my mind has usurped quite enough   219.83215146562696
but at least if i am killed i shall be killed by a musketeer   23.479479092013733
meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another   189.34845693603648
he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from hunger   221.4104342228286
i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state   118.4846052062086
not at all   165.30504449981802
each examined his arms and put them in order   203.69821479190676
and now sir resumed mousqueton when he had rid himself of planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend s fat back now sir allow me to leave you for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself   145.70870704604087
de monte cristo for letters to the directors of the theatres at rome and naples i expressed my fears of travelling as a woman   90.0788501472623
that is true said d artagnan let us call the others   95.11838567465817
but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague   76.10375509903753
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends   142.60667124613286
ah ah   38.25392679141953
and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret   150.69701779555118
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here that is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds   124.53651558940437
dantès waited expecting a question but in vain   128.9154361414097
grimaud gave a grim smile   153.76822144541626
no replied athos it is not the search of mazarin that i fear   37.69865557956061
every one has yielded   183.22446656473437
during the twenty years i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time   180.91277674127295
but d artagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his gratitude   56.995745092915485
go to bed mademoiselle said milady   129.86966223198502
go go at once   131.91146587030255
and the troop continued their route   71.41503349912068
the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice   73.19716229827165
she cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was captain gaumard giving orders and good old penelon making signals to m   63.654206705865704
oh as i told you before i think the old fellow is very close   121.41276243855175
this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes   260.3854255451456
her son   116.07474547267448
ah you fellows are good managers   86.28853768962819
but my dear count has m   146.1705221648099
courage   190.57575851112858
danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence   206.1537717645692
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret   158.44492642104953
said porthos   101.35707858058919
a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat   104.82802986519233
andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom   140.24440509742942
at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening   286.4962875520994
ah you knew that   105.90724061233196
oh it is simple enough madame   101.32237493287472
well said he filling the glasses let us drink to captain edmond dantès husband of the beautiful catalane   60.65073623604052
my attendants obey my slightest wish   89.42984285840564
exclaimed athos   81.29033905777344
i can not answer for the queen   31.42355740826335
each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lackey   205.21290496148805
why replied he i think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband   99.69927999819043
d artagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets   70.19662956278452
no positively i will not go   145.55502079428055
we shall meet again master d artagnan continued the leader raising his voice   86.92278269121385
but the horses were all used up   108.132748414528
said d artagnan to himself   171.32150893773974
her body even pays what she promises i must do her that justice   133.75724420891285
he left m   155.7662843159471
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence   84.99788928852567
we went by bologna perugia and rome   85.9788160419669
ah you are laughing at me   226.4064364024532
what comments must be made   200.8126890934975
f   142.74582499758705
well every time i have seen mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping black eyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin   55.61603483501165
in about five minutes planchet returned   116.03679680040206
well they say that monsieur de beaufort is going to escape from vincennes if he has not done so already   164.60909064976352
then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying my god i thank thee that he knows me only   79.24432553568144
who is this creature   164.981546744806
oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion   75.32059789852563
de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy   158.6901751066727
better if i drink   82.01382284638515
you have exhausted every resource   196.1095508426206
said porthos to d artagnan   189.12556511660162
i hope you will be satisfied with its contents   129.4847781502171
he was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by love   134.44714892566736
both laid themselves down on the divan   68.29771952585216
the same day they came for me and took me to the bastile   81.63065206177326
d artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box   32.82569905092535
if not as priest then as son   90.03552279779943
yes yes i know what you mean the railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not   45.07684355208603
why to converse with him of course   133.46445266739906
that i alone   128.24818478416734
i will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family   32.28562481340005
our purveyor   126.76591672017732
yes doubtless replied d artagnan who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair yes doubtless there is one   25.909209511615657
albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting   78.79789974366716
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor   161.1270651452635
but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors   1.489228359736373
yes i am vice president   146.6665723726249
and now that you have obtained what you want go said she monsieur de gondy   142.1849096109105
how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the count of monte cristo went out by the barrière d enfer taking the road to orléans   59.41421103453681
i hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim   155.10000605007062
whip   20.54809819292494
why with his father no doubt replied danglars   95.93938125876755
the men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported them   134.26448084427847
reassure yourself madame i will answer for the king s safety   70.93463177176832
it is impossible to know   98.27012579928528
i see him   162.27687577518597
how long a delay do you wish for   106.64384991241957
listen m   48.91479768273483
and why do you represent providence   3.1351745806568374
indeed i doubt if it will please m   35.288821416107595
well my dear duke replied louis xviii   92.47976615738463
gutenberg   251.36996069089136
mine was carried away by a ball   41.69944497155575
why you killed him   240.81685443349562
d artagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside   113.34630166645832
calm and dignified said he   122.99076816066817
madeleine said the gascon give me your apartment on the first floor   157.75854311422694
thus m   184.353761558771
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight   198.19190127010177
thanks d artagnan thanks   49.04240634980542
porthos wept   12.363549887070008
so are all italians   102.45496951715046
you   187.38156134417267
bonacieux addressing this epithet to her husband   181.5805954916413
i see   84.89832649409993
the young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his horse   173.25114845739589
it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me   174.4628232291271
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk   99.64805744856525
danglars reflected for a moment   149.69120110688385
oh i am dying   67.48864237469215
we might start at five o clock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels   171.4070484612243
cromwell bowed   198.89565623176793
danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up   193.1587927318633
and assured that he was at the catalans they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring   163.02274160381927
madame danglars rose suddenly   136.2690304051245
those who remain in paris in july must be true parisians   111.69212558676895
yes madame   154.4796099174311
the abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat   120.24142005938296
ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature   111.66810348512321
murmured milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther   73.75681975721015
groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year   223.21875994624213
that letter was everything   99.79406765187647
raoul put his hand in his pocket   170.50627756121466
do not let her flee from your embrace   122.13846055901381
but i think i have it said athos   190.82532644010095
thou man of noble heart   160.02819895924858
there it is my lord said the young man   76.71190848248249
at this strange and unexpected demand m   66.15725335259286
there was a magic effect in the count s words which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man   144.14322879436463
but you will probably learn the reason soon   96.95143144635784
that s the reason why i take such care you shall not deprive me of mine   19.627771264417987
no   94.2335068161263
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation   157.38543455949073
why should they   56.44434669238773
it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle danglars is a handsome girl   224.13240089461527
to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts   132.09969430903158
in ten minutes d artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt   192.14584281360027
you are not boasting   149.19293181668957
and who had a lackey named grimaud   246.6583408830429
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter   121.78729584321417
the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame   163.626802284389
more reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business   113.4055048139395
bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed   115.69927582180203
it is well   140.99476763907924
in fact the blood was rushing to the young girl s head already her cheeks were becoming red   199.85276323634093
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle   143.61746728695806
today is the 30th   135.72787881050965
he approached her   134.44770053755383
and a comforting one too added d artagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man   188.9128544304088
this is what i would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three deaths has contemplated three murdered persons has knelt by three corpses   130.56732682311176
hum   51.83652718325632
well what then   154.52934534994506
and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbé was not in paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abbé was known to be a great traveller   94.8870007827786
there was no family no servant   167.07344214808018
the queen and the duke   119.92892209535079
he found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too accommodating   61.91749581220302
replied the king   57.795585729471775
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin   91.2259873375132
then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment   108.99345786274107
let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me a little of what is going on in the world yonder   144.50826781075514
the dragoon and the swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the swiss   212.11139235343614
after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost   150.96349034504001
but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc   159.90803457053698
e   163.70518577614263
you undertook to do so   98.2081923935798
i told you of it yesterday   19.106382263290243
and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass   150.81711919884557
but one consideration restrained him   130.1838513570829
tell him to come to me immediately if he has returned   133.13553273136782
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage   103.59358788123508
but the lady   30.009228555347363
private interests are as nothing before the interests of all   131.48876040953942
you are a brave fellow   105.87646894475826
and there again you are wrong   62.47382245636413
but what do you think of the music   125.61556656260214
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself   79.5198244657542
but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be   116.56422987005692
well then madame not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days   73.40882482921005
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling   23.541337408205848
said d artagnan   42.64361156791095
i am fond of grass and shade said monte cristo   117.39388524951573
asked anne of austria   59.99398424474406
never   105.28024649852813
oh yes yes   69.26640223927106
but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze   52.9738272578377
zaccone s youth   45.13219646281675
i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said   55.00040631912323
that s what i call love   67.01201265530088
a conspiracy in these times said louis xviii   107.24682730468268
nor you to mine cried the abbé   110.47259698091169
he had scarcely finished when d artagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last time   213.31850755647258
unless a copyright notice is included   81.1253746902021
what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion   184.1774321396648
but to the great astonishment of d artagnan the shutter remained closed   179.71743600888902
he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him   66.9691299790552
true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneur s resignation   68.93851034344175
besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready   155.24125748775583
no if it does not lighten   63.56377416399939
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king s ransom in his waistcoat pocket   42.16103193193072
the letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed   212.95359310186643
you are of my opinion are you not viscount   138.2759302635519
and a first rate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars   149.48168841020936
he exclaimed what do i see below there   134.99951230500224
because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it   115.98954214051248
just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone   275.1032124689552
it is then a service which you propose to render us count   137.10661766796784
the third an excellent abbé like aramis   123.56607492787933
9   37.87655909488845
but like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure   34.258697249841106
mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back pushing his chair on the castors   242.4998574542576
the man was m   159.37681360366977
chapter lxxxvii   104.68804070688867
we have forgotten to mention that the count s coachman was attired in a bear skin exactly resembling odry s in the bear and the pasha   164.18626529962518
said mazarin looking fixedly at d artagnan   143.3845676926531
when   38.92414913295295
doubtless albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready   96.25680677893956
the battle of charenton   43.26813890879701
at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse   116.0422062273087
have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen   82.96040215787457
i mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplace i mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes   154.9165871947474
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person   212.87563282953033
but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities   171.07017861824664
should he find him at all   108.82594259397573
he had turned round to play with milady s favorite monkey which had pulled him by the doublet   144.10866405072798
be assured that i am devoted to both these all powerful masters and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king and also the cardinal one of the most illustrious geniuses that france has ever produced   48.05419208581816
and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape   101.27994732526204
nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose   201.3351812811705
you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it   120.40500968823804
fly then   106.6085932938172
thanks to m   35.59066066727935
that proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted   158.71843477331927
i think i have sprained my wrist said porthos   117.10165161104406
the count s serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand   98.16104786436841
de saint méran wished to sell it   105.66740520164302
no more edicts no more of the cardinal s guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds   34.32069550102929
it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven   46.427311379355956
murmured athos   54.30655525329844
he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general   75.87878496183883
do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine   39.47334919400383
examine the visa geneva milan venice trieste delvino yanina   195.59511466650832
ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation   161.18147078538843
remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work in   153.39293033349747
grimaud hesitated   15.023371331990163
thank you   17.641303718317417
he has opened an account with my house for his son   56.79246053257461
hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice   171.8436084560729
d artagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out   94.93316813479123
cried both young men   255.7762578515705
no false modesty   22.03761114448683
perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march   125.16614763399508
go on i am curious to know two things   156.53556563458704
cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this look from teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of eve and he returned to the forest pausing several times on his way under the pretext of saluting his protectors   109.47538705167237
is it permissible   129.52738370406948
monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   86.28287439409257
bravo   161.86186643745287
d artagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration   90.02298904721701
habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great care   301.6167895951236
do you not know their history   169.27020998219845
who live upon the stones i suppose said franz with an incredulous smile   50.9092012429677
asked aramis   40.87570416887108
you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural   83.27194988039565
and here he comes by jupiter   73.41253165053293
asked the notary of villefort   116.48522201564201
if succor be sent to me i will accept it   185.6189619591775
conditions   110.2236898420821
zounds   65.27577906991603
you will be served thus madame three times a day said he   45.789122279632736
ah   127.00270814667975
count   137.57256943957861
ah is that you d artagnan and you athos   268.8440245292467
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m   43.81803358685053
she opened it quickly and read go this moment to the allées de meilhan enter the house no   32.67204006351675
asked porthos with simplicity   141.76875864248993
you were recommended to monsieur de tréville were you not   23.344549506791367
what do you mean by the pure parliament   256.264697950973
what the deuce can you expect   89.46024250515974
however i think it was something very like a rendezvous   194.4559650910653
yes yes   22.773521811524176
ah   91.47730609112153
she listened and she heard nothing   196.28469797127298
0105m well i must detain you some time longer but i will strive to make it as short as possible   128.07548369290373
when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughter s hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure   105.2722793753103
his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy   270.0093738899668
50213m mercédès burst into tears   155.71801549491562
lord de winter died without revealing anything to his brother   63.56773463353833
a duel in which i hope you will take your part   169.62201247871207
i tell you to hope because i have a method of curing you   217.41686633273815
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend d artagnan formed a part   119.6074759945325
the chief s mistress   62.02163110140815
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something   230.15149713325866
at the mention of monte cristo dantès started with joy   278.70874637040185
said he to caderousse   130.25256628478812
athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained   246.47714025332158
and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours   124.31570164160256
not here he said   114.483749043796
franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the half kindness half cruelty with which his host related the brief narrative   167.9004563706552
to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy   121.13377910707575
no i am alone in the world   7.174183754764599
we will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbé here for extraordinary occasions or common wants   57.616923440368275
oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing   145.4107652229616
cried franz your grandfather says he can indicate the person   16.582901325111237
asked d artagnan   101.68358888811802
my dear albert one word for i must give poor lucien a respite   124.73676241773983
no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act   121.180837766003
1 you said sir you would like to help me but yes   72.72577274413865
chapter xxxvii   2.5190157974440837
next day next day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dantès was arrested   46.305572448189565
oh no he exclaimed not die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much   151.54013667680792
asked the young man   159.87197604488102
oh   82.41681568763644
villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper   47.57551315852133
you serve the cardinal   132.05965211119997
they reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have been   159.34740542260263
on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saint méran and villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor renée valentine s mother   65.9422463457539
dantès smiled   43.87899086104676
0113m here is your chamber for tonight said he   168.58051163167147
in the most german and the least gascon accent possible   138.1513781748008
ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian   112.53782214767396
afterward mme   123.75212076744506
shall i call him   172.88715690789434
that will be four killed   152.1457401367026
pardieu   208.72606277947773
and you know who she is   190.0658956471655
good bye till we meet again   74.71582112430926
and how many hours of reflection do you ask   203.10894640050657
chapter vi   83.51033332033228
you do not propose anything   31.446053307997474
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass   118.28360141872606
yes answered athos but his right place is in our ranks with the prince de conti de beaufort d elbeuf and de bouillon   183.95594040376176
lazare and gave it to villefort in the meanwhile take this cross   140.91115156714787
yes sir replied mousqueton   88.18988704854895
life itself may be resolved into three words erat est fuit   56.04390631026983
said d artagnan   166.37894208577097
but they all understood what carlini had done   178.9445988659575
no to be sure replied d artagnan   74.0318581906586
aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queen s manner   46.19150060782897
you are crazy   77.99158882952565
and wherefore should they do so   77.45335173503126
the intelligent creature was received with loud applause   37.72620404508376

then turning to d artagnan she said sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received   132.80854842534842
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing   85.87811051778914

well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house   71.23005718097832
and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with you   142.85016633254511

of course he could not inquire from d artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career   100.32327628081111
and d artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver   50.528082045999525
but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me   93.0459401078177

30261m it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a half circle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglars it is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation   72.73187132789153

exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality   241.62058933105237
still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding light without warmth   90.16468355802826
come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go   134.5307085728629
then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor   66.53187073944852
not if the choice had remained with me for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts   33.85106616645331
but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes   94.69982249470713
without doubt   55.57061546584143
adieu gentlemen said de comminges   52.58901067089688

orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded   67.8982342845303
but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take   79.65949846659788
said porthos to himself   3.8792149494035186
speak said the duke   84.79885516466612
my faith it was time that idea came into porthos s head   46.18738753535129
i was not in voice   110.54727992911197
the deuce it is   44.5170473452401
i gave you my reasons   115.53618871988391

when monte cristo turned round she let fall her arm which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door post   114.93088469662162
the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nîmes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the child he might become acquainted with your person nay he might even then have known it   94.82452415820029

well then we shall go down into the court   113.73951699244094
a gentleman turned around   164.15690964247415
and could you not stop your fatal career if you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it   33.02967201453018
very well what did i say to you   137.35329449846543
in truth my dear captain i have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to mademoiselle de chemerault to whom i promised an abbey   70.39557460397299
on the importance of the step you are taking   7.656899901420118
for five hundred thousand   121.7099908285523
oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him   138.98356998008907
five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince s door   162.79726231014854
i shall find a way   59.94878055915619
devil take me   34.72605338820348

he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render valentine supremely happy his name moreover can not be wholly unknown to you   246.82120974304115
why really the thing becomes more and more dramatic explain yourself   76.40716802119537
it is very convenient then   135.51129227255075
i am mad for her   63.41382236636395
nothing can be more agreeable to me   89.66017895158417
what will our two friends say   156.79713106064452
come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody   202.49185703551905
the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber   44.31633644945818
you shall however have his answer   110.8681245101772
all that would be folly   139.93185850402185
all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom i thought my friend and who betrayed me   70.4480445045608
for the king   128.2993518324611
yes duke yes i know you are very indulgent toward the queen too indulgent perhaps   175.7722631950558
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it   100.29119833108751
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman   18.9149723405815

danglars which is one of the safest banks in paris   78.52989805206914
poor dantès   194.15073102905183
strength and sagacity continued   193.46562876590718
charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter   103.80749602545819
save me   180.64679717560685
well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini   73.26815450877872
and now my dear girl said d artagnan you know that it is not good for any of us to be here   180.3352596675692
you recollect perfectly all i have told you do you not   74.62886907441239
she had already been an hour in this apartment   197.1691617434313
he was out of range   200.8978358389054
really   31.713620056745214
there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallows bird   106.21152343805822
those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death   59.71121768433988
exclaimed raoul joyously   206.02186278644677
then on the anniversary of the day on which i had been insulted i hung my cassock on a peg assumed the costume of a cavalier and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to which i knew my man was invited   156.91676027376195
a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh   168.91660072952027
asked he after a moment of silence   75.96553513783377
after passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raoul s way of riding and observed take care raoul   199.45911115612012
then he resumed in his turn discipline monseigneur has i hope in no way been forgotten by us   157.58618777104547
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray   273.92844389256504
may i ask how much he allows the young man   98.52752088194552
occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let france settle matters as she will with me resumed mazarin   189.49509784306528
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it   150.97022801903583
and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard   80.24020439885096
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spin i feel very keenly fernand that this is charity   145.02282195021232
haydée   118.9864113182237
that is forbidden me said grimaud until the last moment   167.04996651997595
an entire wing of the villa was burnt down   176.42089696828083
tis easy to say so but that requires money and i haven t any   3.0451032512541047
porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion   164.69182200773878
cucumetto   119.89229048038935
by my faith i ask no better cried bonacieux   56.60391160478376
i gathered myself up my knife in my hand and when i saw him near me stretching out his arms to find his victim then with the last cry of agony and despair i struck him in the middle of his breast   40.191629444332534
athos understood all now   165.80715005124375
the king s friend said aramis   48.43084969974781
observe to nobody   151.30017362071737
but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her cheeks   32.51334930830329
the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases lucca della robbia faïences and palissy platters   48.755348653427646
they both listened   60.931887164637644
at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franz s imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina   142.4998962568766
madame danglars did not see them   69.04909251572155
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty one years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master   112.9134599107778
rely on me   101.15979863147012
it looked a race of phantoms   147.21744382496428
the conference being finished the queen summoned him to her cabinet   137.16156733068803
mercédès smiled sadly   157.2382475490636
the ring a token of his good will which is here   113.25286218055106
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot   106.40896111580092
i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there   275.3623766407732
your history is a terrible one mr   165.44246905643413
by me   24.777398352281466
empty   123.18567645810815
the spaniards   102.25070543727574
monte cristo quickly appreciated all that albert had collected here old cabinets japanese porcelain oriental stuffs venetian glass arms from all parts of the world everything was familiar to him   78.46711623319338
he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial   126.39815516946534
he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards   8.618655315799359
you understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases   61.59682981834345
then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame   74.24570933792883
she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugénie   185.78792032464293
yes you are right   157.17260448546472
i went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten o clock to breakfast   44.29746938103382
thus all may go well all may be for the best   98.7904761456893
villefort s conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage   113.26593020072988
oh   206.57890072870396
he sighed and set to work again   107.60827262524388
i was pretty drunk yesterday d artagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous   188.20055448456765
slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road   195.6995874671096
the past that obscurity on the past   141.9002950257651
gentlemen gentlemen cried d artagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is serious   137.7643902080663
the count is very temperate   57.56069924707638
but if the pharaon should be lost and this last resource be gone the poor man s eyes filled with tears   212.69153430395653
would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours   43.644412696851276
what are we to do then to night   58.02679119309092
i must have time   211.05637736562377
aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cassock   125.12661206875289
we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments   78.31768957471633
cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing   157.278695135342
cried he raising his head with quick anxiety   145.12674205726128
the fortunes of that monarch now are at low water   125.94664385329528
while this dialogue was going on the two young men and the poor lackey descended   139.48407619908332
but my lord said marshal de grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men   117.74166427656034
not one struck him   85.89775234020367
eh dear friend said caderousse are wills ever made without codicils   217.78998984323601
the pouches contained 25 000 000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30 000 pounds of gunpowder   3.497787446761933
my misgivings had been but too true   166.13176588947846
let us save the woman   89.17231017886142
you have at some wicket of the louvre a concierge who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would mme   79.49413287597218
he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought d artagnan   212.83407173261335
aramis shook his head   28.818096831572518
at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head   140.5046254243776
asked he   94.29039862405315
yes but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate   96.74226469450082
in their stead d artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall   130.17846514564417
i have the note said he to athos and to his friends   84.59007356227406
i am come sir to ask your advice   84.90521144556368
at this moment carlini heard a woman s cry   167.9722052026875
so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general stock   295.0952455667262
she has always believed me sire to be her enemy   133.44777704198498
said kitty   83.8629332069419
you are the king s servant and must go wherever that service calls you   104.55157029119245
eustache   125.59332678436282
yes   152.91149838485845
nay i know not   178.2754817303355
of high treason   160.65651990073462
de tréville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess   107.37499085247237
de tréville accompanied by the four young fellows directed his course toward the louvre   157.00899982291054
go to   81.05119773670592
d artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy   142.28188369878043
how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster   67.95281835737268
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them   199.1669077043115
i can pass   137.3925004430425
and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six o clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening   139.70454635403323
you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four   158.48986960467775
at his right hand was placed the superior of the jesuits and on his left the curate of montdidier   99.69533593614868
château renaud who has lived in russia will tell you the name of one and major cavalcanti who is an italian will tell you the name of the other   169.41999233478703
d artagnan sire   23.715276734603663
he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace   146.7589779125741
and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him   37.775658766051166
and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy   121.96662355892667
it is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry go round wheels and rewards us   180.15268914595953
take it from me when i am dead   14.5469510237169
said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud   48.24120668457441
chapter xv   167.6010645585837
she lived in the place royale then the fashionable quarter at number 6 and he undertook to call and take d artagnan with him in order to introduce him   171.99696073610357
that is to say patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks   91.6523047352187
impossible monsieur   70.57294254938007
every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows   207.24211425497026
no   29.12984813378965
in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party   238.25806953386075
the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design   99.35067953891291
he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand   173.22771116753472
how does that annoy you   141.69221813602212
my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity   209.84569675846024
we are safe on that side said buckingham turning toward d artagnan   94.2674546808766
while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course   127.77997878389358
it shall be as you wish madame said villefort   47.39157687714099
we are much more likely to be killed said athos if we do not go   108.93478212117256
no one better   52.99557788091866
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day   39.284480775449424
god help me   189.82074144240835
cried dantès   209.2232487617327
the editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beet sugar probably a composition of his own   228.67863378750388
these conditions being agreed to porthos took leave of mme   99.53807027188338
oh yes especially beautiful   50.9273291116843
and why so   113.13586674686663
but tell me valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart   100.51645277467946
poor athos   75.58914817623909
but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal   137.52850086735626
this evening said the governor   124.11264904477737
her very self   45.19328846609743
in brief i regained your harness and then mine   65.20963958828659
yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty   218.0031009258347
what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me   0.17186611063279145
well monsieur de montbazon is the husband of madame de montbazon and and madame de montbazon is the mistress of the duc de beaufort   4.770457646415537
signor pastrini remained silent a short time   92.95386597065456
said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom   135.8969688631244
no doubt m   133.78677733843298
go leave us and join your sister valentine in dear grandpapa noirtier s room   72.50813924371118

provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants   14.266333727044724
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head   181.05685227445977
but that will compromise me sadly you know   111.72323101035988
at the same hour as on the preceding evening d artagnan retired   79.52196065000598
de boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration   238.35740407611945
begin with me my lord   37.99106151929773

i swear to you i protest oh but god is above   109.18256317906358
the conduct is infamously violent   10.627482042668959
d artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated   172.37595400480606
it must have lost its ferocity in the second generation   99.93872287897672
germain   85.08614579235594
athos threw himself into d artagnan s arms   42.29727653864926
would you like a proof of it   194.90538914653854
but as to d artagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to ours has driven him out of his senses   110.78426957798843
let your servants guard them   92.69145407774901
yes yes   149.69674142865819
albert hesitated a moment   168.85905214091855
you should not speak so to an old friend like me caderousse as you said just now   59.045705201805106
three or four days to return to paris   99.88724946667156
why i think there were not many intruders   114.80493006772967
he will never believe that my death was suicide   192.08374933292546
he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the bishop of noyon   231.38555839873663
now will you make me a report of all that has happened   127.26122218857176
noirtier evidently intends making me his heir   107.08022695013713
and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judge s seat but on the prisoner s bench   127.0809058765594
open this book and i will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix   135.62101603950137
it is absurd said debray   217.36395704133383
d artagnan and porthos went on meantime to paris   141.9737659669492
the cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses   64.32722981320325
he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous   153.41082568113993
they sat down to dinner   112.74563715372274
come my dear albert said debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes and that like madame de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story   72.50031032492163
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars   95.97708334562832
they laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in england   92.60442621844415
do not disturb yourself do not disturb yourself   112.68792043023848
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible   184.3032376483277
but the night is dark said athos perceiving that lord de winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear   132.93762610780232
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger   114.74047513756578
mazarin started turned toward the comte de la fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the pen   176.72490709953755
the messenger without replying a single word bowed took the letter with the order for the two hundred pistoles and retired   1.3217021401907658
escape as lord de winter had thought milady s wound was not dangerous   175.95537284278478
be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monk s frock   105.99139677808759
oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with a grin of contempt   259.66798200237463
believe soft spoken gentlemen again   120.04254604987257
he who wounded jussac   109.28161464559825
cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment   50.92887256311616
pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing   192.29293859209497
his face was much agitated   166.56770380842633
noirtier s eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice   56.26358451596128
ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where i could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges   175.46506557703248
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived but have you only two days of leave raoul   9.021489376950242
this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted   112.12732581714967
there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy   25.355230837991556
ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil   112.22862791401974
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required   146.67657972128643

and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives   72.23184709757314
it was not without foundation that a report of the king s intention to leave paris by night had been circulated   133.0097949506197
now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be here   138.39981122668996
the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it   135.21363730127803
his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off   129.49217112688402
you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon   29.564593440719634
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m   23.578024025862618
look at me madame at me whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly   67.87390146322649

d artagnan   127.5419948693974
grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner   140.5739231724257
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake   89.25693263230269
she had scarcely closed the door after her when monte cristo appeared at the corner of a street so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant   153.6696820037053
the foundation s business office is located at 809 north 1500 west salt lake city ut 84116 801 596 1887   44.39231778991777

i recollect this because the poor devil s death was accompanied by a singular incident   125.6190776178976
they appeared to be in concert with his enemies   154.41783249145033
these steps came on came fast   66.2348490322913
inquired porthos   156.04059708989053
no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released   16.459750111305
and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him   109.96816057281332
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter   212.6419817359345

she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it   120.43552820219563
ah he has a palace   159.2193948365648
where we have orders to lead you   124.84086826622737
the file on the corso broke the line and in a second all the carriages had disappeared   96.23649573542292
at the hour appointed lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent   184.79849765771172
oh sir reply i entreat you is not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember handsome and brave a musketeer under louis xiii   93.65034794498528
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo   37.346594020492546
he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury   51.02855828144209
de la trémouille who had nothing to do with the matter with the loss of his hôtel   168.59150433795267
i understand you   153.7121876001559
i want to know what crime i have committed to be tried   163.73707879340196
i am dipping a biscuit in a glass of spanish wine   197.57856162168792

d artagnan does not tell you raoul said athos in his turn that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his time a knuckle of iron a wrist of steel a sure eye and a glance of fire   115.00552580499154
noirtier whom you see here   30.726709555887027
in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality   39.20397716384787
come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to you   200.10427747166946
he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to madame herbault and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilian madame said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally   76.29554040814094
but the fact is i was made baron and also chevalier of the legion of honor in return for services rendered but but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs   93.94528779914457
tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not   200.03058506729565
the same officer appeared   91.74119535497505
the old man intimated that such was his meaning   165.54563097163222
but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress   111.62384377126388
what in the devil is the matter with you my friend   57.25232982978566
then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground   70.76337845838515
s   42.24656904341231
woe to them if it be so   75.04600584093382
who goes there   170.7342315107433
in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs d œuvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grétry and porpora   173.40878976689783
if you stay out late be always followed by your lackey and let your lackey be armed if by the by you can be sure of your lackey   127.0863654197902
why do you sing thus and with such a voice   149.46407923526993
where   169.5338068229135
now then albert cried franz here is a bandit for you at last   147.34436116276717
i speak to you in french said d artagnan   205.98219811088188
heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself   205.34194297225775
my lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future   146.2832923860618
of madame d aiguillon   119.16467512869619
my affianced husband returned   108.58605174195665
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the count s stopped before the hôtel de londres   21.545651726903458
to morrow we shall retake lens and beat the enemy   97.10075789047532
we must see what it is said grimaud   81.45435654513457
well said monte cristo you are fortunate m   154.57654671834013
i may continue to rely upon it may i not   135.8356015259757
it is 40 000 francs which i now owe you said monte cristo   116.86766627452923
the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished   239.14323855808527
said caderousse groaning with pain   111.68139360261283
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek   136.04242707931093
this athos then was a very extraordinary man   101.48319679228882
giovanni obeyed   249.64230713805253
in that case i can give you proofs   84.49035909153423
pardon reverend sir said caderousse   125.08565619727065
at least wait until the story has a conclusion   109.68633730910244
the abbot ch   58.609056562906865
your excellency will do as you please   169.72529173903473

villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary   143.86370020577428
one day as i was setting off on an expedition go said she   108.44004720519524
asked the enraptured villefort   56.547823933349186
at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase   68.32469033554418
cried the swiss   78.34037943598848
exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness   93.6912945562578
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened   190.35581791665746
help me   171.58685883624122
look out   70.49007234799087
i have plenty of time and it will be more correct   65.31737968581292
said d artagnan   60.31866687711158
and what method of surveillance do you employ   122.19390954537677
no replied the latter   133.17170559723243
the short one   20.339626802605068
good   6.3087531171024125
your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again   225.74153374948955
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters   169.6495968364472
do you say as a monk   206.48903433349113
our bark flew before the wind   106.11911838068207
meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form   64.79405696339231
this excess of bilious humor could not be attributed to play   84.01283264166219
you are perfectly right my lord   66.71508446492021
i will make verses said he   113.92384085709267
it is more important than you think perhaps   51.71058564819805
how i worked how i hoped how i struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade   57.336805376257864
there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals   166.545928546219
i thought said franz to the count that you told me there would be but one execution   77.99310136005457
it appears however said lord de winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me   162.87495991977056
it was porthos   161.396901456997
i was sure it was so the hanging of people is my nightmare   206.83001187959957
i do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords   128.7448082543781
the one between the pillars on the first tier it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh   87.15021252778334
you believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheries to that infamous sardanapalus whom the blind call the duke of buckingham and whom believers name antichrist   110.99214570658157
your swords are in the corner   198.19944469627205
really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned   199.39360123417487
have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas   125.30237890736643
said d artagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us   76.28341923692528
there fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material love that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption   140.8060057729228
five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance   114.75264178732303
that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine   77.24490438172747
people laugh outright they weep for joy here   157.23341759637495
but your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear porthos said d artagnan directing the sick man s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles   20.555004881909554

then you have no religion at all   107.38122109263011
at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good   75.13305179554828
my dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within   50.2017701263167
ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three french attendants commanded by myrtho   210.6740581188883
eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m   207.70847658131356
ah sir   147.1823754537597
m   111.01331990452596
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now stands   111.81421668100886
the glance was of sublime eloquence   136.78701813062978
i could mount him with thirty balls in my body   92.97176615734122
a favorite   16.11380732431401
nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of him who thinks   50.329434829488704
for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed again and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself   171.00604106329394
you have made up your mind at last my lord   200.7260877231092
come gentlemen come   111.58565273919541
the brigadier and two pioneers fell dead   79.84828667129287
people cry out long live the king   76.03038407898939

you will be wise to do so   68.989595090668
monsieur d artagnan continued the queen i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first   111.89885292819505

monte cristo pressed his hands to his forehead   103.27875338801712
and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little better   190.67814250117476
it was time two hours after he was delirious   71.92182976758106

raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count s arms   103.0976115749632
prevent me then   185.90854582430524
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair   56.694693094904856
but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a word she uttered   196.48147841225384
eh   93.91572588359693
i said mazarin with his most smiling expression   66.71187090245184
why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for   112.52230626811941
the countess paused a moment   90.22415522835257
pursued as he was d artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping   156.44859974843882
felton my brother my friend i conjure you   160.05034429699887

the keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself   162.23695752087093
ho   131.4608908407728
i needed nothing less than that consideration my dear d artagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer   101.99834424360266
said d artagnan   102.80921029433038

1   223.76214914224403
and aramis wouldn t swear   88.05395551380307

on the morrow he received the last touches of mousqueton s brush for an hour and took his way toward the rue aux ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with fortune   167.46565088532842
yes yes they all said at once   134.01681399407983

and remorse preys on me night and day   54.99451699807152

the count almost staggered at these simple words   39.66099930715174
was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him   116.56655864290099
yes before others replied the doctor   91.53024369124375
that they may try a month hence to marry me again   127.10651794368827
i heard it from m   82.61661729686327
only that our enemies have escaped   30.363998377891363
so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner   60.7938096540061

the best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said d artagnan   105.31739428673309
employ them if your check with regard to felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind   1.6414320797677107
do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness   212.5452139495861
a change   100.54696666479958
the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming   70.27512514332247
30159m yes since you have known me said morrel smiling   204.70918679222729
i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with   53.178820683494536
said the count   42.318147016585314
i wanted to see the good curé again   182.5631574734443
was it m   120.83378602107753
well be on our side now resumed aramis   22.422311648355034
athos bowed   73.76956336720454
well i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsieur de marsillac whenever you please prince though he is   132.10904437720035
he will tell thee what has become of her   122.71689906246351
tenacem propositi virum   130.42735570893893
certainly remarked porthos   146.0094851281056
without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it for all my tears my cares my exile and my chains i have my youth my prayers and god who counts my pains   152.16994317140202
i am betrayed on all sides   97.97926657512544
approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undertone   30.723097632283398
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom   91.54441000133562
i have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day i will assist you   140.73476503453264
and yet sir you may make me even happier than i am   77.32475091093433
and what do you think of her personal appearance   171.68612700062354
yes   158.16489517172724
come said d artagnan let us inquire further   117.78653049051576
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary   105.55982994152635
what the devil could that handkerchief signify   162.4394685005293
one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone   195.3918988093062
the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed s head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself   105.57126254102346
at this moment grimaud appeared at the door   105.09316077381993
valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served   134.9632005828126
monte cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight   68.95916455556406
but now m   119.62459734275376
sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet   216.53412793233474
there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration   140.4812879997982
he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possible that the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him   77.29168126085133
i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake   209.13712140105463
come answer freely   157.48407706271593
a letter   159.8937825686659

here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will   43.373043440261384
unfortunately he was in a bad vein   134.9031423519225
but tell me count will your people take care of my horse   210.1940180904556
coquenard whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table   35.90830223311909
ah   70.32424762461898
with pleasure replied d artagnan   93.50758793275376
danglars watch one of breguet s repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past five   144.11801578385058

come come gentlemen said mordaunt impatiently let us depart   59.48666698214487
he is therefore a great noble   30.582273295222805
the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child   139.33315001670363
i will return home instantly   112.07518265680899
yes   94.39843110254039
and the four friends quit the room leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont   104.94776352839772
the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fish for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat   18.441850274818222
yet i must know his name   51.97568382010968
she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to walk   156.04374670907373
yes my lord   186.95849578989805
a woman s caprice you understand   112.00244632714238
but when i went out he followed and quickly came up with me   113.69076630388265
said athos wit his quiet tone   148.8047960981803
monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir   6.498761420992139
planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible   182.19560160396156
and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one   75.68682860303898
here is the relic she said   145.6477462175898
but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel son   77.0773138557827
the mendicant had kept his word and made friquet his heir   53.456845759375945
boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights   80.86080470719193
they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously   7.671633615720822

perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart   95.33233273960695
and the man   113.95223340750671

then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city   45.06134632944277
he could not recognize himself   143.05691738334644

asked porthos filling a second glass of wine   16.476494714753414
but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be won   147.7089346913047

he had moreover his right of entry into the omnibus box   71.85486717280853
at the sight of his friend porthos uttered a loud cry of joy   126.73975073746715
f   101.62744815990905

through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressing room the count could see into the street   179.15005023289285
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see   145.27487628900107
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he re entered the hôtel and flew toward kitty s chamber   131.85282306108348
what a strange man you are   190.28785282641422

do you understand it   99.24789660494025
they wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them   92.01131438663774
yes replied aramis with an absent air   181.3048070309535
you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m   85.89849277871122

about seven o clock in the evening the boatman had taken over a young woman wrapped in a black mantle who appeared to be very anxious not to be recognized   134.53340461057255

said caderousse   116.76269828553266
some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister   61.17577643470546
cried the two friends   120.57288681777824
at the same time mercédès reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore   55.20244205877623
and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud to the opera   182.3410718722155

and then   142.75929788075055
how farewell   128.08533559951476
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty i encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty s service in whatever way you may see fit to use me   148.74847883978194

you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house   161.86415703744203

he visited his own dungeon   106.0419815735699

it is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms   187.99018121682954
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health   155.06955821440434

his head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study   99.90782356412606
around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings   118.81024850255284

rejoined caderousse quickly   109.63549945868544
unable to have me for your wife you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister   173.64743838763795
some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide   188.39582583799302

after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to cardinal de retz more ruinous than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president molé whilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes   35.84700319945141

but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days   199.68217193083177
and athos bowed to d artagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts   165.9171141906166

all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone   20.098065419912132
we have given ourselves to you   235.50775458398152

said mme   105.81689411158939
but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive   117.03919557328476
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade   113.4948948520269
cried d artagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the night   92.04759817355878

the noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won planchet that was the name of the picard   147.4613911059849
no sir but i am severely   128.62834075727702
porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine   87.01006117113363
but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it   125.29235515805243

the chances of war said athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them   149.57548412763063
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night   195.3009118820364
go on then   126.2055753109804
said gondy reflecting you are right sir   174.52789536690372
morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him   59.252030378760445
he may be very famous at rome but i can assure you he is quite unknown at paris   169.24842141045752
and i shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages   199.6691498674643
d artagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments   98.86460912346567
muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection   92.81738814379148
i will lieutenant said the soldier   142.13164764914927
d artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handkerchief   140.26924386345274
it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on   156.78912627019585
let us consider first the ancient rights   57.57782142445478
de villefort sent to tell valentine to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour as he expected the notary and m   133.62728910456968
danglars   99.90698191099547

she was not at home   16.15113844700346
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on   57.084687454301175
of the cardinal   121.24112458379362
then you can come and dine with me   164.8522559366686
my dear fellow i invited them to a dinner the next day replied aramis   119.86953427372599
the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time   86.04686208823325
well madame   179.22601592460285
that makes no difference said aramis coloring   205.25403626251227
his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of robespierre he repeated this maxim of tristan s gossip divide in order to reign   181.45142940344638
continued the count in french it is necessary to excite this man s confidence   51.74393834909321
but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you   129.9681971101666

andrea drew the garden the court and the house   192.9423075936684
and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the door   34.145683245625236
this order was also executed   142.1105490857427
with a heavy heart d artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry   211.44735471433003
they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees   48.55521953511031
ah me   64.34557626172328
in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate   223.19911164134777
if we hesitate what will the servants do   215.10231522147734
all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself   74.57780527952775
bravo villefort   65.89711940860953
he wanted to kill me   110.9718170948911
i suspected it   54.32294778785414
in conscience i can not kill him   58.95643509327046
have you not mentioned that name to me   76.80617389418694
well commenced   84.78117251517831
you don t choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned d artagnan   78.61758489230843
monte cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa   190.18340680908798
cried one of the ladies   107.37817349248351
there are loaded pistols in your holsters   102.87497693434298
you will perceive that this may last a long time   107.2015315100978
the sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed   115.1700321279007
in the first place i have as a precaution shut up at rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable ones   185.77536785780384
in beauty or on the contrary   123.53285464363596
true monsieur le comte replied d artagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him   28.296635988538952
what do you mean   84.52449645962076
said athos   101.50529488905542
then i have nothing more to do here   97.0852096241152
take it then but in exchange caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand   122.72234511227882
it is fair to assume that dantès was on board a smuggler   102.52312286406749
poor assunta had guessed all   162.31008958025632
that is the most happy and brilliant evening of my life   218.2822704698959
nothing dulls the intellect like sleep   48.64800768646383
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of d artagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his thunders   138.79044999546423
but you might have shown more confidence in me   143.8958406357054
let us unite again not our hearts which have never been severed but our courage and our fortunes   120.81074996246511
if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them   218.14505855649873

said d artagnan bowing to the officer   137.93231494686523
and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath   88.89406445240107
yes   61.131110291306136
out even to me   99.767477487218
aramis resumed his own attire and left juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to him   130.72032255934164
said he at length   144.09546599883265
the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light   87.66712061339095
nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start   121.13695442276146
no   130.581449448364
said aramis   64.91983915920824
well dear monsieur la ramee replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king s health   155.80804976361392
etiquette had no minutiæ unknown to him   125.8032641955656
what the devil are you going to do   92.00550205681364
it is i mousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road   148.28755604496533
one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely wounded   88.57155888539155
inquired eugénie   107.86039274706802
the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor   178.67864940272145
i will go on foot then   124.33132149228597
it is   100.16049099025018
but that i am not ambitious i am going to prove to you   122.58555295924846
her beautiful face was distorted with agony   142.2222191604139

marie michon who made the most charming cavalier in the world pushed open the door put her head in and asked for hospitality   40.65327700573444
never never   68.07739628623509
yes   136.90439888102765
afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage   57.61431346564914

said valentine addressing noirtier   176.8495190039916
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way   81.9103575209547
their horses were fed but not unsaddled   160.36224653895334

we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him   187.90959975082495
very probably answered the count   63.32554532829501
do you think it is time for us to enter the service   83.08585825923288
you will lose the preference and that will be your fault   177.27493393543313

0295m it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased   162.5911426610524
porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary   67.57722258269501
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal   94.63986337978571
it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen   175.30954720823433
some day the people will burn that house as they burned that of the marechal d ancre   50.00894674255915
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force   156.34487123868976
rochefort all is not lost   197.04063514745394
i understand   59.974424102697625
no   202.11823985780262
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time   141.53137627491867
said she   135.12072280216995
a change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleidoscope   64.02620531501478
what do you say athos to that proposition   62.62255102422191
asked the young man   82.49093200047568
you do not understand the points of english horses   155.502339138315
there is one thing the queen has not signed her assent to the treaty   237.40338715266103

if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him   39.94608527034468
his opinion of me is altered for the better then   161.27763031294157
but cried dantès it was a hundred and forty francs i owed caderousse   45.70754633047309
your wishes shall be fulfilled   126.7375788404219
for the demon of speculation drew a line or in other words projected a street at the farther side of the kitchen garden   98.03298182116745
cried the marquise   35.4325266697374
for instance i say to my friends be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two horses   56.2948617938329
and he mounted his horse   193.0996758113186
since i became an abbé i dream of nothing but battles   119.95268525069653
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared   218.32474762509645
then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance   169.75854547913428
the unknown spurred his horse to a gallop   14.748100906850524
see what good fortune i brought you   47.2441173717106
you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties   85.41377164887939
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist   122.20070483650649
i do not think that is the case   136.3195526585176
replied the englishman   135.44880124232964
he then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume   89.53484954967107
how can i if her husband fails in controlling her   201.43072036715347

villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy   141.84323448560428
you have no right for you are not my father   169.10058090775763
yes   126.36684712364745
villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin   146.7320884767404
what prince   116.52722141534035
you are not making any mistake are you   8.961283338475624
the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with him   59.58314837971281
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles   120.32894356977023
mazarin sprang forward   112.37151120997261
when i need your assistance and the moment arrives i will come to you count   98.1408999528139
shall we obey   89.02124092167028
look i shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to us   92.40749114242718
the two guardsmen courteously accepted d artagnan s excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone retired   153.13054239968943
said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt   125.07992670058157
de morcerf so early   108.56003851698051
they passed the barrier without accident   230.48194155865463
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all   102.66190338038052
five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions   133.03506413727303
sire go leave france to its real master to him who acquired it not by purchase but by right of conquest   170.5931744970212
old men are always so selfish in their affection said madame de villefort   171.26662997004425
and i too added aramis   137.47857637448533
of whom do you speak   32.773614334370464
what do you fear vasiliki   223.46677308725722
the next morning she found her grandmother in bed   96.00927057326518
has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens   166.5488551004105
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second   103.27586188970976
the general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs   201.99859509579662
and so my friends we return to paris   199.62043269170857
oh do something for me   91.75706082059739
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds   23.557031594535474
and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day   49.01024262795774
no   19.656302779122797
monsieur said the young woman you weary me very much i assure you with your questions   98.82994487754729
remove the mutton cried comminges   134.38615097518021
he knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man   120.6924022095913
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner   196.56171746435237
it shall take but a quarter of an hour i answer for everything madame   9.349271511330187
besides which in a short time resumed d artagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety   245.5085801010189
cried the king the scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds   63.16578850343206
ah you surprise me   115.6269597980873
it must then be the visitor he hoped for   204.4498101125493
oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular   138.631207975879
de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him   74.47574130926404
and they called château renaud s attention to him   165.2745950801501
he is alone said grimaud   117.52221270160935
anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends   148.65883840820447
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you   89.44377867419169
in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine s mind   150.7365128635274
how so   146.20723205736488
having crossed paris it passed through the faubourg du temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the cemetery   133.13681963619254
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefort observe that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefort villefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession   109.87063255220805
said franz continuing his investigation   209.37600819223744
you want the cardinal to come here   196.71184053400532
accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him his blood has thickened   87.14430595914817
d artagnan let me confess to you what i ve been thinking about during the whole of my drive as i looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes   22.603794548051752
capital   126.81882494806867
i wrote to him from boulogne   165.8990416723932
lucien   141.80899807872476
on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk   216.00392492252496
the same story muttered the jeweller   141.02279231429623
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies   176.3948917446947
the colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion   12.98904422378996
a truce to compliments said aramis   206.6960355384349
the same said villefort   63.40771382481515
i know them cried milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart   97.61468098514914
she was attending to the education of her son   168.30571815248896
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness   192.6062008327789
and there was no fear of being taken at his word   92.70935118614506
if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery   94.30946588807502
my death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure   209.81974082680654
here is what the letter contained milady be at the first ball at which the duke of buckingham shall be present   74.82341945698701
here is the prisoner   122.14090404117766
no he is a man about my own size   107.98813848794167
does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the ironsides   196.4238687238491
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door   103.37494637270431
but meantime send for monsieur the keeper of the seals   99.42239329455536
what should you know about it   89.39161760669327
milady uttered a cry of joy   182.6996854747083
so you see in what a situation i am   106.43229659982345
the punishment   202.06376388292017
and what was his reply   21.80011226135855
we will grow old together and talk of our companions   85.91004084966937
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft   120.91235871349517
i found the tenant   211.6169180976188
read it   163.80781789309054
three weeks   165.94854139719126
luckily the captain understood his business   83.43551791232551
had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dantès or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words   81.25099319628954
nothing very difficult   176.16789685564544
let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself   120.06645710760775
cried d artagnan   67.65041741651333
and who is with madame   49.05892300410211
devoted to it   34.494004830540135
ere long marseilles presented herself to view marseilles white fervid full of life and energy marseilles the younger sister of tyre and carthage the successor to them in the empire of the mediterranean marseilles old yet always young   4.228251948592714
well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take that opportunity of going to paris   159.86736870639857
he is your man do you say   179.03573793285204
the second that we still have some very important things to say   148.15204542496392
i don t think he put the faucet in again   37.872144950765545
we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and double barrelled guns   19.190449240394514
but i perceive i have not much to teach you   204.00186467227795
the young man now knew her secret her terrible secret the secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except himself   199.47577283047772
the tall man alone inhabited this house   141.3588993250719
they were a pen ink and paper   165.76867663464037
at length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their ears   168.45906401939104
risked our lives twenty times for your majesty   156.9284462136685
but i do not think it is his right one   177.76519777963503
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said   127.32633405416806
there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you   215.74007680455833
yes   111.7638890061708
to interminable ineffaceable infamy   177.69972767561902
oh know him   104.71829701778202
well really nothing is certain in this world   32.90500849809234
ah monsieur   168.52441013425116
de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money a thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready wit in default of money we repeat he authorized him after the reduction of paris to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules with the motto fidelis et fortis   59.60401579753011
you see my poor friend that i am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness   214.2202761030055
i hastened to the innkeeper   38.6323158833393
at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner   140.5540808220665
i will get access to her without her suspecting me and when i catch my beauty i will strangle her   34.994548043099215
mercédès said the count i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by m   144.0122187810838
so far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your love   202.47879344258402
mazarin looked at her and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts he read her thoughts in her countenance as one sees in a transparent lake clouds pass reflections like thoughts of the heavens   177.45022857609226
the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and disappeared   151.28512393509695
i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he   205.5827169072393
excuse me gentlemen said the general   103.49381485421026
continued franz   71.55697669201994
you should recognize him among a thousand say you   32.02968247212837
i faith no said d artagnan   137.9656510178027
andrea turned pale and drew towards the door   153.34731763979076
there you will find hay and straw for them   276.9578564098588
i will listen   70.08990440220839
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body   144.08749680521754
aguado and m   11.53530377372104
well mercédès beloved by you i would tempt fortune   3.6009089731901582
shut up there   174.7173251602324
it might be a vengeance of milady   108.29002675697484
oh i will find it he cried   64.48570253199674
i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted   91.44149249515978
and what took place   233.18764102850164
and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane   56.533673302183715
inconvenience us   124.97199379151922
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you   141.220638658971
but you know he is now our friend   17.587887604802717
very good   37.86162363924424
to whom was this letter addressed   154.24321877125385
no in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now i think of it you yes i faith you re right those delicate yet firm set lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart   22.481686784324026
it is a pleasure to work miracles before them   163.46069351380928
speak   80.0389940023021
oh   172.25662929931676
yield   136.40547969517434
and i was just asking the same question of albert   137.32981547579746
the nose hooked but finely chiseled   137.89193981662254
cried albert you are not a preacher to remain standing   120.9911816305238
the musketeers lackeys included were seven   141.3601973745334
and what have you done with your ecclesiastics   116.22962972907952
everything was conducted in the usual manner   53.49586599963724
noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself   133.79218682460504
because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric   182.1941719604696
count said emmanuel when they were at the end of the place royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours   57.20352369248484
the assizes chapter 110   117.47687299358238
it is sublime   21.551312569395733
but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged luigi to be his guide   90.17648155828319
and how is he connected with the question you asked me   176.00904243074606
his looking glass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition   113.50528978430957
yes yes madame you must   97.08454046651657
well said he extending his hand to monte cristo i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house   97.3695778551861
you shall soon see him   164.49808745953024
i have lost all that bound me to life death smiles and invites me to repose   139.83890596114352
and pray what do you call such an action   106.17979567036548
when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you   70.45045913716282
she caused the unfortunate duke of buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere that honest good and pure   99.8753659076258
they carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antechamber   80.32463208589405
the matter had been named to him by d artagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the danger   86.62802396695392
one may soon see that you re a soldier   188.9207305975521
again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape   172.00027933626254
rather say to take him back with you into the world   142.3992517727196
but hold out your glass   126.17211431899051
perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but i love him for showing so much interest in you   55.12388737811189
and unless his near neighbor and would be friend the count of monte cristo possessed the ring of gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this time   134.3326044261289
20039m penelon rolled his quid in his cheek placed his hand before his mouth turned his head and sent a long jet of tobacco juice into the antechamber advanced his foot balanced himself and began   73.87988564667918
the courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls over which the sun glances obliquely when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deformity   117.4114215220039
i would arrest ten of them ventrebleu a hundred even all the company and i would not allow a whisper   59.96238991267655
i should be more than glad   101.82120687319457
i believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than herself   112.21382050907175
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away   64.1806396814392
you do not understand continued the inspector   108.6104530436036
the people will rise   116.81818962962076
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets   49.55462651453891
oh i declare to you felton i thought him mad   186.56250174576968
what do you say   74.99286105178004
besides what would the sailors say   71.25079750623007
shall we be quite retired   159.94843986703563
my god my lord i have long despised thee   151.86816615033646
on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received   197.7022468899645
yes replied noirtier   171.1858352145266
no monsieur   62.223703048847554
but a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with cardinal richelieu is no longer the same man   154.2491468719066
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil 27 rue du helder on the 21 st may half past ten a   101.72690328522361
when d artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve o clock was striking   3.0771317634097244
she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m   6.442141004688551
that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults   113.91748096913865
on my word of honor   148.56619632340397
but where is franz   122.04176237011426
asked d artagnan   91.44551957472996
yes   27.876150792370723
no one had the slightest suspicion   135.42723520282465
de tréville being informed of this by his eminence packed his portmanteau   208.37927605465256
he then set himself to work to count his fortune   119.64668543436869
let us save them half of their journey   42.63525605268758
athos waved his hand he dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head uncovered   130.85980063317274
yes   38.234369666204444
when the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des fossoyeurs that is to say when the forty pistoles of king louis xiii   102.09902141579403
what joy for my lord and master du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   3.509239351557582
then we will follow yonder cavalier   82.96953061911461
de morcerf he whom i wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom i announced your promised visit and i may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person   231.96128228721687
egad   166.6957259398747
well then madame yes i did feel fear   200.72703404327942

at the first glance d artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy   103.62529824499194
god grant i may not have done too much already   169.3273537785724
i am glad to see you are of my opinion   70.96863405156728
the first object that met the eyes of d artagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions   66.50220207877715
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game   158.68192153576533
the conditions will be better than afterward   22.873549391966534
and when madame danglars recovered from her half fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream   56.81889204418786

and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving   94.717403431741
as my grandfather used to say i once reigned in paris   75.69797336659072
it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant myself   4.388517837917291
yes said valentine i will now acknowledge you are right maximilian   101.96253092632634
they are   77.60224631647222

at length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountainside   1.7187716141836091
no said felton it is nothing   276.6613212071997
be easy on that head replied athos   62.09577875812955
but resumed la ramee that is only a way of corresponding   116.99300179360493

that he was leaving at the same time as his letter   215.70063143431537
shouted d artagnan or you are dead   155.63039513486717
at these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed d artagnan out of the room   104.20319159080844
yes for you who detest those unhappy princes beauchamp and are always delighted to find fault with them   166.20067614547474

while faria restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the stone into place with his foot and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery   77.0310293994489
upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor pastrini cried franz   105.52946672634657
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son   88.83837304605323
the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin   108.10976957514215
i respected your father very much said he   116.05130035359872
but carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of rita s father   131.6107797458396
at five o clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had   145.21157951784642
i only love him and a young girl called mercédès   109.08827996268175
asked villefort quickly   129.68796912705747
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did   100.4797404078342
they will think we are trying to leave england and will search for us at the ports   152.9433750055638

and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted   119.02830776402467
nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them   116.74693499799476
exclaimed the monarch   76.9098068911126
nevertheless whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey she resolutely drew near to aramis s shutter and tapped at three equal intervals with her bent finger   100.24433494471842

this did not seem sufficient   71.71619694808908
as for me i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home   85.5398505670763
you will promise not to betray me   244.2609492155387

buckingham left alone walked toward a mirror   41.69151408925987
sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution   89.78783825674331
it s a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said aramis   105.22733287845989
but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality   258.7767692543172
my sister is happily married   158.45172297226065
a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction   20.362099719700254
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the people s good will   207.94427656356504
how he had responded   39.67567355342334
the valet ran directly   108.60778630074448

twenty francs are not to be despised   162.36639794135658
we should be hard to please if we were not   101.51535792602529
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs   70.02878998357653
the count was alone with morrel who remained motionless as a statue   112.75533370106521
for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone   97.3941436018906
he asked himself   126.50185099883852
no   101.62388693997607

d artagnan refused   206.93572395411286
said the count   11.382090618956795
tis a bad example   149.33927709397938
at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard   27.99715288545842
but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare   4.258196925337813
on the doorsteps d avrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others   18.546551463674746
you had only read a line or two said d artagnan   140.48836714797415
that s a fine age   25.62579776649426
how many men think you you could collect together to night   55.46911977236

the young man knelt down   171.68951606249746
there is not one of those women egyptian turkish or greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy a doctor and in psychology to amaze a confessor   153.11484412771813
as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants   152.509350740414
i hope the accident has been of no consequence   186.52704696760077
with that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties   46.32744496261378
what she most desires is a letter from her intended   69.99657395319508

franz thanked the count for his attention   90.23001408169921
where is he   124.18099772608642

she knew she had only two days left   148.4380485923849
the notary looked at the count with astonishment   89.61920469427677
m   35.060002269471994
and drew from amid his rags a hundred and fifty spanish double pistoles which he laid down on the table   91.25507715363487

over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persia s sun or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor   174.52091319663054
cried aramis turning around   140.5110675065061

if you do i swear to you for i have got to the end of my strength that i will dash my brains out against the wall and you will have my death to reproach yourself with   212.38977885877347
the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal   161.3006328095626
and i shall be together with my brother in law emmanuel at the disposition of the count whenever he thinks fit to honor us   177.35625970687354
an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones   59.14845604506268

and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical   203.7645001256597
milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat   7.230609609988221
when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall   169.9656768130713
another person was confined in the château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest   88.4296034475434
oh   111.31588121552343
this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of m   184.00175550710725

bertuccio sat down upon the chair andrea threw himself upon the bed   31.216856268480512
franz coolly cocked both barrels   83.58994227527033
still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerf s   163.2169644224388
as to our liberty we have that   143.08126258310628
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it   80.9162080920883
for la rochelle   183.33226337694634

he wished to subdue this woman in his own name   136.94576018184017
cried mousqueton   171.77923754896062
and francis the first who was as i have heard say as good as other folks nevertheless lost the battle of pavia   188.20972518346085

then turning to athos he added i seem to miss something here   129.61715775965385
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness   199.0971164415107
and who found this father for you   155.64808652674952
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime   194.78761227178916
but i was obliged to pay a hundred that will do that will do monsieur bertuccio   150.44994729465685
athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord   163.2708791340367
come with us said albert   124.93312814318372
whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazin s house   141.82885412437793
the count read it   195.3319919737702

the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugénie s character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking   186.08378260194485
and he disappeared   98.28674858584071

excuse you for what   153.87493275343434
two musketeers were pacing the court to whom d artagnan called by their names   17.036473238017408
he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink   221.6359646282312
she had not long to wait   84.22775769099917
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate d artagnan who had time before him walked around and re entered by the porte richelieu   4.96101902031468
but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers   88.82119312925255
but why not address yourself to your sister the queen   144.48983138202058
i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness   268.1914812962147
his eyes glittered with delight   46.3556497930599
but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize   197.00155488891684

you must have much reason to complain of him   134.00357419050675
d artagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods   168.69896270621388
mazarin bent low before her   180.4437154938484
would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose   251.41198186776376
i am coming mademoiselle replied he   145.08679897125236
his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression   17.53336988955813
for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis   180.35404227951557
do you know in what crime you are to day engaged   174.66138603406807
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for d artagnan and grimaud obeyed as usual   13.41057506172109
you are quite upset   62.88289754902893
then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which frenchman would combat against frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy   154.44389908186915
yes i insist on it said albert whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings   196.40885575722777
it bears his signature as you see which is all sufficient   71.55236302367047
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto   82.92092487726426

but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter   95.1637211844751

groslow advanced to the door of the king s room replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple yet touching scene then turning to d artagnan assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved   140.48008460497942
there followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching   51.95952871692769
devil take them   243.89309552598658
well   125.17610183186598
the cause of misfortune of religion royalty   67.9749981874333
he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest i strike you behind   75.13266696354745
another queen in want of help   58.58886915617334
what can i do friend   112.50429499405043
from the day i first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection   76.71997911974641
presently the army came in sight of lens   243.00622501123405
he recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard   107.46441421233891
on the staircase he met athos and porthos who were coming to see him   80.30535041019152
conclusion on the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of buckingham s assassination   81.58759397195905
my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor believe me i am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you   244.53731317656803
i never was in a law court   99.03576450678301
what has happened   144.11963499700875
the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly   54.03882630906357
have you seen my mother   21.331674872196274
you know i hate moralizing except when it is done by athos   41.28803199171453
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers   171.59069007623737
he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared   117.39379588110337
marseilles resounded with their well earned praises   156.43257622911247
but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts   83.54547152929169
for shame   58.91138188350118
at first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the missiles   126.50716838852014
or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others   161.40690616613435
i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this continued the jesuit   127.60052165497429
his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence   97.93567398440295
yes surely he said he said   20.627695042531954
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin   119.41614910811028
what   102.37590154198696
and he wiped his eyes still moist   170.39849696100782
he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army   211.29611783005208
because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors gentlemen   153.37630613042614
her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like mother of pearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish hue   155.77839056338377
that they must have patience said anne as i have   97.49994330054405
poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a baker s door but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited   42.0539525744759
porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe   111.41648653184194
but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthos that is to say exactly upon the baldric   61.11384471651901
let me ask you why you deceived me   58.63900064535153
good   116.17458186037439
command me madame   121.99739640977587
his early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever   111.94917650757007
au revoir albert   10.355911423276353
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed   186.98547410110834
the dying man s eyes were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped succor would arrive   132.00340533115155
dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé s plans   151.52820811705325
but excellency said pastrini still striving to gain his point   93.42179121452301
tell me cried danglars in a tone whose bitterness harpagon30 alone has been capable of revealing tell me that you wish to despoil me of all   10.131038364810422
but monsieur said the count of morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arms to receive you   90.60314676191199
i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment   162.31784622589623
barrois therefore as we have seen watched for valentine and informed her of her grandfather s wish   215.7601057175873
madame de saintot has hastened to him with broth   236.736844560934
oh   136.58380979733587
you were right sir said anne   149.64857938442083
chevalier take my hand   214.27441169711832
you knew me once   191.02441639952377
for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions   133.6391870498413
cried the baron i shall never console myself   10.08907804022769
the riot   155.48600858552143
he opened the window   84.36798357248048
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort   82.10698575303178
awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressing gown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames   120.0775312757734
while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke all things which appeared to d artagnan monstrous impossibilities   132.33380791317643
i name only the most important   67.24960599799276
planchet grimaud bazin and mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from athos   158.56430287946495
have it examined by the governor of the port said the shipmaster and give me the preference   105.74444110819874
my resolution is irrevocable   14.339866457777404
at last it became aramis s turn who performed it with a good grace and who succeeded as he said by selling some theological books in procuring a few pistoles   62.7929799854409
where will you begin   165.13224219498946
the ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one another s arms   40.581614054489734
milady had guessed aright   127.00023029008757
on the first floor   222.144808816421
a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared immediately   74.0623959428685
and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to m   211.72195581694177
the same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king   174.63174333789675
they wished to take planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five o clock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis xiii   15.325877896154424
and turning on his heel was about to re enter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which d artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse   12.048274072716012
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated   86.20483844331439
just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking   58.333430443482584
watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure   96.81482952574264
cried aramis   96.97833000385708
albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the papers looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet   122.01738580643172
baroness said danglars give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome   142.42825894139304
yes just so   134.51368071000687
to london gentlemen said d artagnan   190.22856155416014
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them   132.7816975942535
bonacieux recovered her senses   146.13847831331324
cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet d artagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme   6.8362648477797165
mm   185.43840025591442
come if one can t always eat one can always drink a maxim of poor athos the truth of which i have discovered since i began to be lonely   67.37771086999551
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room   186.26797694854963
you do not believe me m   65.1465015319622
if by artifice by entreaty by accident in short if by any means i can delay this marriage will you wait   138.60287920258241
you are a man of genius and you know your worth   199.88345572309632
no sir no said grimaud   119.06955711430632
said d artagnan half rising and bowing   5.575300800419043
but if you yourselves should be struck   79.43606723931578
go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day   11.55250211850607
truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits   153.35576619874524
this mysterious shade spread over his whole person rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth even in the most complete intoxication had never revealed anything however skillfully questions had been put to him   163.1787645795058
but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i found nothing   106.94556121505863
are you quite sure of it   138.23694222487296
he however arrived without accident in the camp established before la rochelle on the tenth of the month of september of the year 1627   69.81330908893065
ah   194.1052229397114
40302m it is just as i tell you i assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this disclosure   115.65674366340785
the smile was melancholy   117.37195701548178
but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming   156.3061208115729
both sir   107.01493396540316
he was concealed in a thicket   48.87912254828329
and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a slate and thus learn to write   264.2905592959538
it is to these powers we should rally   131.03550540916606
well am i to rush into his arms and strain him to my heart crying my father my father   75.99589690135147
but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared   10.91501532050458
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets   51.76148236886567
madame said athos passing his arm under that of d artagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman   96.85917526509057
asked porthos   162.1433405431478
milady and rochefort exchanged a smile and separated   93.14958059678666
d artagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact   167.4516553163169
mouston   66.31772394403374
de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child   159.98328085003038
what makes you think so   55.957385074800655
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt   230.2999594071974
this evening you said   158.5408508109644
d artagnan alone did not seem convinced   218.86471278385687
these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said monte cristo   109.66010345925918
therefore i think of sending him away from here   142.77595092001422
formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman   81.19707328758088
caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder   151.85459566146545
cried raoul swimming on   100.85556517053332
exactly   97.93436805902887
what are they   237.8763805042471
pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace   65.23165046246464
franz and albert were opposite the via delle muratte   128.77700710460076
aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in athos s closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords   134.9637040088514
oh   155.41813773708924
asked m   111.30967603079121
well   60.72318557153034
cried porthos   57.722737731210906
in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there   109.30450490522915
in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly   117.71490527811676
what proofs do you require   147.25778529430403
mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain   164.56771610451756
take her six bottles of different wine cyprus sherry and malaga and a barrel of ostend oysters   15.413693818073668
i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him but perhaps it was too late   93.05090072920913
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of d artagnan s heart   122.26052813670103
my dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box   134.72873503501472
ah yes said the factitious abbé who began to understand   155.8859209516049
the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded   91.4262230765992
nay do not press my hand edmond   182.12437229119354
by the female side i believe   104.933481834872
so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me   3.0112468779288264
me   74.89971817466039
now we are getting on   169.4587950039376
he recognized albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomposed   103.00032643792147
caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other   17.54306229183497
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order   227.53138851544634
with princes not with presidents councillors and low born lawyers   19.52260734719586
in truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers   167.05526613277556
certainly not exclaimed mazarin   99.46028283455522
the very madness of the abbé faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity   45.875987569545515
then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty   143.0523441961291
that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé   152.45387063750817
his name is zaccone   138.8705443752719
that is lucky said blaisois   87.71500863899719
my father as i told you   106.7194540777575
while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermen s boats white and graceful as the sea gull or the merchant vessels bound for corsica or spain   79.68028687803256
asked the owner   157.68286993453424
but then your word is given   253.71191172413575
aramis cast a glance upon d artagnan to see what effect all this produced and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws   69.25886319562095
yes i understand it well   145.3511932418008
and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the pharaon   128.14532730639758
the count seized it hastily his eyes immediately fell upon the epigraph and he read thou shalt tear out the dragons teeth and shall trample the lions under foot saith the lord   142.76852733507818
your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes   25.357254694113294
i tried to pray but my tongue was frozen   132.69511383684258
the people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators i see d artagnan   49.11163483300548
i assure you madame replied the woman it is as i have said   134.89435551708215
that i will have a little romance made of it wittily turned with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance   217.36781786404714
the two brigands looked at each other for a moment the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow   76.93462260863605
pardieu   166.13108802144592
if it is god s justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house maximilian turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose   113.55895984987504
i have three who would be honored by joining in the sport with me   227.84116828109939
asked porthos   173.82034223874706
it is only the dead who do not return   97.19963572906144
not at all   88.76113809006497
i don t like mazarin any better than you do   215.1554536974224
danglars no longer had a daughter   36.710371530106045
with certain people everything comes round   103.71590549369475
very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate   199.0317069197946
planchet with a gorget indeed   133.27199894803832
and d artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal louis and rocroy   168.60477274133933
for i saw the account and copied it down   142.59157834428436
the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature   239.62941917213752
yes yes said felton   147.92478033130135
inquired the astonished merchant   75.99032853800888
here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner   122.68816607498128
said porthos   90.40734295076427
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob not a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarin s witticisms or by the jests of the multitude seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place   75.86185612180196
why do you call me baron   136.67488189198195
and he swallowed another glass of wine   112.4319734640175
demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm   76.65254608162185
cried d artagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man   204.05697308287822
without doubt replied the jesuit   115.44190506672246
who are you   177.76896400859886
cried eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance   172.78897783287778
egad   142.0959772159789
again repeated villefort   202.95946354223446
poor edward is as much m   162.90123826881052
a ball at this season   103.98916509878639
as for me replied porthos i am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting   161.65256890074932
he said to porthos   201.60517886995493
this was the price of the queen s diamond   178.07366968200145
d artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity   102.50679889291746
a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot   181.20622224958527
the same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt   19.825773003298792
villefort placed the arm of madame de saint méran within his own and conducted her to his apartment   29.878010419071103
not such as he is now represented broken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb   95.130334503368
thank you la ramee said the prisoner   58.00668703603634
or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs   134.79085210397793
grimaud obeyed without replying   94.23709950689135
the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught   117.57697571709329
neither of them there   266.25660149485304
you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are   97.61227321719258
the company of french guards was composed of half of m   141.76266054956366
i want to know the route i am to follow said d artagnan   178.37977294974718
debray colored slightly and followed with his eyes the direction of beauchamp s glance   126.36700350102623
i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it   205.8222786851867
richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect   211.5425478287062
you have no idea then morrel   19.551252755969614
then come here   90.30869214623672
and when did he set out   125.07378344884486
i can not stop a moment   157.3140441290364
oh i ll answer for you said the gascon filling porthos s glass to the brim   146.7036898563541
oh let us speak of it   127.7592504195674
d artagnan almost leaped with joy   115.09676806156747
meanwhile let us sit down and eat   93.62838593738955
upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles   120.87529961404766
i wished to punish myself but he has pardoned me   38.59913886740446
these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation   157.29849867077115
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five and forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage   169.0953661601332
although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m   165.41147913760287
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelle en serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place   64.06517401894959
he said   109.07318538544416
oh attend to it valentine i entreat you   169.9783201583912
chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock   138.91990557484328
germain   139.4841886197803
the monk exclaimed   98.01117712130898
i am grateful to you for the sacrifice said aramis   92.78390714706947
said d artagnan that s settled already   138.23129420666658
and think you that we should find him at this hour at his post   143.39947971313228
asked monte cristo   91.9164852532571
what do you mean   59.82649385887793
barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string   173.78175309348515
you see i am as exact as you are   87.48740753688321
her hands are icy cold cried d artagnan   68.06682046008265
the beggar of st   152.4341200596116
go on d artagnan   173.1594689549712
the family name was fully given   23.248174592802144
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin   103.56495323581557
how so   146.20779673318094
the abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m   206.96917270380783
he immediately fell backward   64.69948101557061
but there was still another step to be taken   78.71088455393783
our wine   70.54701921408355
ah he is not a man like that cursed d artagnan   113.319998631819
then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act then one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society   118.6804374835623
when someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress   142.86709114261544
then replied he my visit is ill timed   42.799144702802806
in consequence he brought them the key of his own at least such was the apparent motive of his visit   205.26885244851627
and mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the isle of dogs   146.8742595140483
let us draw lots   152.90297722991195
yes madame said monte cristo   140.2933707661141
ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service   106.71305906718672
who were those men   98.85933675363579
cried the marquise napoleon the type of equality   52.53221946189605
one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening for i have seen his servant   91.03979224743132
the avenger was conquered   124.84245201377898
do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control   84.89561532981514
you can not condemn me   143.7680310086218
everybody pities you sir   75.93106200529677
such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant   93.15422376247433
you do not like m   156.81885422352292
but i tell you monsieur commissary cried bonacieux in his turn there is not the least doubt about the matter   223.6351112961356
said he   166.97488957211513
chapter xxxviii   57.19684861161736
what   91.27160995658413
no my child no said madame de saint méran   86.34108468065605
as for me i play my game squarely fairly and above board as i always do   175.50258990612522
i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister   62.21287543125407
as to d artagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again return immediately to paris   134.44675949904405
but i heard the noise of breaking furniture   160.58158716847262
and this evening at eleven o clock you have heard what i said   150.0265317621839
we have only the vulture to deal with   180.70841940252993
the morrel family chapter 51   109.35737532785176
his terrible story is recited in the chimney corner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep   164.4599138760959
albert sprang out bearing his moccoletto in his hand   160.6322780417364
that is to the purpose   117.44275899292354
but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies   259.4883469540854
those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queen s courtiers   135.99135446128338
thanks to the sale of his horse he commenced his career with four more crowns than m   1.9079813671971806
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly   168.20502034142154
pray how many men have you on board captain   152.38625233340355
listen then lord winter   80.16900961223706
he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and bone   122.66395123676392
upon my soul everything degenerates   187.10382077739797
but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering   179.45809914031622
monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel starting up cried out you know of whom i speak count do you not   157.3295846177036
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought   161.43545864297326
no no   84.68335704759409
for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled dantès to learn it by heart   109.7468826108952
for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight   192.3511098443212
and any other love but mine would have sunk beneath this ordeal   146.44831793505125
yes   102.45129035255329
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell   5.407343242093702
that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise   132.7339019612518
well then with well acted good humor i allow grimaud but no one else   113.48326445458397
have you traded it for your diamond   128.84128410944402
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting   33.21548597718919
it begins to develop itself said d artagnan   45.24098428882053
milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks   225.14521305362274
farther still perhaps   120.39703312511934
follow me said an officer who came up behind the guards   258.17755059518714
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them   310.53454074175505
inquired the abbé   79.1713940342826
but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them   131.49198054525897
at least you should tell me what i should have to do in london replied bonacieux who remembered a little too late that rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wife s secrets   124.07418820744748
why in truth sir was monte cristo s reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope   167.36218028606007
i admire candor   196.0128626423619
what is his name   12.870425243137532
a man was introduced of simple mien who had the appearance of a tradesman   149.70647214326988
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos   86.57067324195772
but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces   167.39085545093914
in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m   196.04364146271638
they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known   147.2876064692114
you marry a money bag label it is true   61.509944553091515
is he dead   74.61926260368165
in good time   107.64500722249865
deschamps   101.93684940589037
one day he carried off a young girl the daughter of a surveyor of frosinone   120.45229193172771
bertuccio left   54.18595095489665
said porthos a little perplexed between the two i suppose as i came with you i must go away with you   67.21680345614924
40252m that is quite my opinion said the gentleman   32.284633454169
my father said haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled   267.4230384159888
you will not love even me long   96.48850463205912
the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegarde a little nearer to the former than to the latter a small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard   224.4080218705741
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return   95.58400762533577
morrel amazed let fall monte cristo s hand   20.06218391597288
i was in the power of a man whom i not only detested but despised of a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do   80.96257295994548
again   104.93568354513823
it appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his journey   15.462400986098785
this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels   90.10754661516036
buckingham took the casket and fell a second time on his knees   2.7306809147765136
he is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform   125.75646127089996
dead bodies are not kept a year   46.433046865034
yes i would do so   132.9443063034509
the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles with directions from dantès to join him at the island of monte cristo   195.92813478620738
demanded aramis   162.9561944320949
we shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament   93.30112933406733
afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean   99.45980597984476
let us go repeated d artagnan   133.02837773406023
he said to the lieutenant   99.44906103384187
yes a chef d oeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied athos   145.0904631811194
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly   105.1759365602115
and i wrote and will show you my correspondence if you like   106.9124677498489
but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of 500 francs per annum paid quarterly   124.5511680030312
where   107.22104497488495
but do not let us lose time   75.39432517902469
the second notary had also arrived   147.75343326646006
are you sure said the queen doubtfully that you have not been forestalled   0.8183384438838459
asked d artagnan   201.43778624708926
in each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses   64.28883101201723
albert however felt no less insulted   180.31846897182973
said laporte   147.42994796310953
de villefort   229.38901494676048
have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence   134.27028857788548
red with fever while the large drops fell from his brow the man executed one after the other the three signs given by the count in spite of the frightful contortions of the right hand correspondent who not understanding the change began to think the gardener had gone mad   177.12822932867448
yes my friend   154.36434051832646
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry   172.71487256831173
alas my dear aramis said d artagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are relating   119.1422960894106
and if they come back fire   193.08531255670408
i am content to suffer and to await death   103.08054061945835
but said the baroness i thought you never put the money out to interest   76.7595095298233
take this pen and write   126.43738133761362
said athos   15.130115679206227
villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair   100.83743257740048
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes   92.88041625527819
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out   244.17037602689828
aramis wounded as he was seized the mane of his horse which carried him on with the others   125.5660988189855
and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished   11.28764310735339
worldling murmured the count   165.35969310927862
what must be done   139.18354542454335
mordaunt was among these   228.76705891675726
really   54.97741884515516
now said he will you come   42.588991492886635
andrea cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess   188.3833094942609
the sign of the red dovecot chapter xliv   86.57366451890519
and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal   229.4866048483152
the count of monte cristo is always an early riser   22.30336701928441
how pale he is   103.89775590827465
i understand you or rather i am wrong   89.57299514344379
d artagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger   186.87656791706175
edward   98.44696694570659
i dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense i had left my saving knife   162.83035387999334
i ask your pardon my dear count said albert for following you here and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that i did so   147.4888256780393
are you not married   111.53687528502942
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when monte cristo went one evening to pay m   129.41933046128725
don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth   22.066087416863752
inquired caderousse   245.5462199739664
alas   149.8988142362719
alas   112.77616746453656
you possess the right of pardon   148.2279808606092
the king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said this block is very low is there no other to be had   197.46374155415128
madame said he if i dared in my turn advise would it be to give up broussel sir   118.44117568838207
de villefort to purify marseilles of his partisans   159.46029547390538
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur d artagnan there s not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him then my lord replied d artagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me   68.11995973224015
oh my dear friend if this be the case if you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then maximilian you are consoled do not complain   107.7311001959717
only i tell you beforehand the carriage will cost you six piastres a day   0.9561536322208326
sinbad the sailor   4.635758249170891
s   12.018675965106837
but we must not lose time   212.72568583685106
according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the door   23.61880054079306
it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which valentine had drunk   109.36892196387122
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publisher s office   54.53877847927435
certainly not   143.27218272793817
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as d artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas   97.46016552166387
ah i had eighty louis before me   50.41138255000041
but he thought this addition would do no harm   77.96232267010342
a young man   188.898367816337
come take the lantern and let us visit the garden   83.95018050079432
said she   111.53878514260407
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark   85.89289293547226
baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address   56.05269682165937
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him d avrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it   181.3490700863518
he hastened to open the secrétaire and found the pocket book in the drawer and in it the letter of credit   132.3672386875414
at this moment villefort returned   146.9893928089768
cardinal mazarin as king   31.622747845479708
and turning off he entered the drawing room by another door   52.172566932646376
the devil   24.403033216863705
always the same always the child s corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture   177.0158285185477
no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and d artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever   168.40196204331875
for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions   212.79848473606955

the queen smiling made a sign with her head   69.44300781676074

your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides   92.5815846413544
but speak   66.95977275645583
bonacieux could hardly hear what she said to my lord duke of buckingham london   187.0923110414413
you have scarcely seen my mother   20.560549202997038
d artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant   154.01681913912267
your mode of life as a smuggler said he to me one day will be the ruin of you   43.66732176854714
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on   29.64143750570372
you ask what i have against you   50.446022166759064
the duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the words   86.42237784752737
oh i remember said d artagnan   83.90172780474384
i assure you i intend to play the devil s game to night   81.4326449625463
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day   68.7889880003341
you really have some distrust then   212.36521295227962
good heavens   189.46154772118584
well on the faith of a minister   230.85791535744733
athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice   198.0762227882008
i am brutal i not only allow it but boast of it   190.29636524103904
it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off   219.88882156393754
come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves   99.15351202106791
now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated monsieur de beaufort   133.70185300568932
planchet sir   142.07299481668775
adieu count till to morrow   97.27314843637522
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion   95.40992360418413
he inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor   56.14202648533059
i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion   111.13260788208726
but i warn m   159.99287711798408
the frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled beppo   21.185497794421508
you can turn their suspicions and save my life   170.44894770458606
no   58.792025482384645
then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas   111.88855868163333
replied porthos i am what i am   67.67578867694863
look after the house wife and i shall be back in two hours and caderousse left the house in haste and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken   81.01431972286825
how do you know that   3.0078173875421044
what   43.16031737145879
if you could see my heart said d artagnan you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity   110.50233780185177
rest yourself first my lord and we we will reflect   124.12001303149476
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight o clock in the evening you are not here no money even if it be but five minutes past eight   59.038347140450355
the duke of buckingham assassinated   61.886213290373625
i know it well   153.12891804563415
but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him   49.10697925338327
there is something horribly mysterious under all this athos   16.116296909689368
beware d artagnan beware said aramis   100.14030959417451
for i am the only culprit edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude   214.94314750042886
cried he and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her majesty s presence tell her what you have seen   86.09548415796732
fortunately as d artagnan had thought it was not dangerous   208.28313171994284
twas that low fellow bonacieux   130.6210166024364
so proceed   132.8584464403884
and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock   138.60327772186784
the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there   116.65691683431415
of pale complexion and brown hair   98.10978452904503
it is doubtless some spy   205.2634003921085
may i ask if you have any news of him   104.57330692675684
good bye   114.88583719761735
his voice was stifled by sobs   82.07827665226174
dantès turned pale hesitated and reflected   33.757338386345424
if i had any money said d artagnan to himself i would go away   71.03356196982321
in that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand   63.20560416819464

villefort seized the doctor s hand   112.07525034718869
captivity the fifth day milady had however achieved a half triumph and success doubled her forces   151.88043265542552
answered the voice of her he sought   143.9255663008608
you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa   190.915606043889
but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow   184.03090834059455
yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate   105.31685420742012
help   72.7565369104097
and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again   104.69662437469958
this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions   87.61988786529223
this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it she implored the captain to put her on shore   100.4383290385481
the comte de la fère   183.11966124897697
and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high   68.81142192330762
you hear d artagnan   180.25997233548048
it was dark but at eleven o clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion   133.87096816692366
observed debray   121.20398433107874
said every voice   204.18201461564476
had she betrayed him   95.3397781201407
let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded   151.3500558998105
yes said monte cristo you were a major   70.61976018487175
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation   34.01232692577136
i will not acknowledge a crime in my house   144.29299893921785
but you say you do not wish to kill me   128.79281328605762
thought the gascon where has he heard it   265.39831754934426
he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber   21.601403184842297
and should i forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection   44.75763895875089
and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird s water glass   181.0388599900704
being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal proprio motu   73.28889931817699
a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time   162.38851523454582
asked louis xviii   91.31598766209397
that would carry you to the end of the world   65.88696497845821
a fine idea that of his said danglars shrugging his shoulders   206.51870918958406
now my young friend said he england is all our own   117.92779646055386
valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep   33.972299096310294
he s not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite   72.54314158311574
ah   126.81600433259278
d artagnan thought it was proper to follow this example   71.26930088535096
the young woman continued to advance   104.54152667721073
but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber   187.32222103652782
no indeed i am not   182.3877924407546
ar † spada   146.5480947325883
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired   86.70221886033934
you will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word forward   196.69299902110382
i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste   8.337864172607837
and for whom for some grisette some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some garrison   129.96338122632915
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared   69.5039171137712
no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest   77.09812988291876
the other three exclaimed   132.8445159717048
and dantès knew it from the first to the last word   122.76793262880841
she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again   227.92827301891117
two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the island of elba   93.75204374377074
that s well said the cardinal   11.16178580068042
then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of   128.72723053402242

captivity the fourth day the next day when felton entered milady s apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends   99.94803100494161
barcelona has risen in his favor   117.00793677816479
and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols   56.73404851220837
gives me pain but will not prevent my walking   119.0348591165429
do you hear that   27.191865505652217
monsieur monsieur cried mazarin you are breaking your word to me   71.59994088230229
she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation odious as all his calculations were   61.77196593290446
4   20.049938215809163
so much the better   183.44141459813477
villefort sprang into the passage exclaiming the emetic   107.9500687527221
i see   60.37819449467172
be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear to me from the moment i am not obliged to see an enemy in you   82.21801252883941
and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny   88.30963420760594
the castle of bragelonne   125.9448266880916
said he   114.58001196237265
and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him and as he prayed he wept   70.84842023450602
and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay   60.407269163755004
yes madame another service said athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him   104.99190005634074
that sets my mind at rest   81.86683676007459
de bernet were exiled and laporte did not conceal from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant   134.65148402184633
the devil   103.16101483864324
after having stood a few minutes in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp dantès eye habituated as it was to darkness could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds   169.03592011483283
the porter was not yet gone to bed   139.123833944863
edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years   69.09323616957452
said he i see   134.79596920569682
thank him then my child in your very best manner   76.7313867356581
stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i have had   86.72504565064816
my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you   148.68507486715643
madame he replied monsieur d artagnan s prediction has been accomplished   66.25933260175013
we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while i sleep monsieur du vallon watches   10.118058733014664
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source   137.19211021725042
why bind thee   176.71432026103508
the explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present   120.53285864756067
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves   3.688222694116277
give orders to the coachman   129.85937698268094
eh   134.6024820475701
morrel was dreaming and monte cristo was looking at the dreamer   5.602835110296567
the countess de winter as they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from d artagnan not all that had happened but what d artagnan himself knew   162.4716987156488
is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him   122.63435407586316
eh it was that that did the business   36.47811810566287
at your service sir said planchet overwhelmed with joy   111.24911618932022
still i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers it would have produced such an effect   176.2463664057355
me   125.38212007383478
yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way   168.73848142266706
no my lord   103.74174171408268
for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de tréville to whom i was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his friends   176.39315181736268
the count returned to a small drawing room on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also   111.54387120967199
alas said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy   32.459511448371984
the principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep mme   73.71706823877932
porthos told him of it in his calm manner   35.46402125413563
make no allusion to the past   155.90637534706107
i believe near marseilles   84.22538424753378
rest assured we shall not see her   108.89325035193473
louis xiii   86.06475181170202
the more this young man was superior to others the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him   127.43384485621229
and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done   60.71570624006596
s   52.14141043670456
good again   111.36273544109568
how   107.81837844504794
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti   119.70541572021729
no one has ever dared to give me any   136.92056432209438
upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin rueil   107.90223033244348
asked d artagnan   96.6391641138855
athos merely glanced at it   79.81746717194414
sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room i have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince   261.19358182587064
ours egad   182.86256230780032
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrini s side   43.395516051455814
have the fugitives been pursued   199.66012487184446
during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart caderousse s words fell like molten lead   198.59767461528463
yes yes   58.512451317286626
people fight for all sorts of reasons you know   91.98816298704662
the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it   206.9893401256669
asked aramis haughtily   149.62311711061884
with it matters go on much better and more rapidly   159.49594733986837
search then monsieur   245.10393446485693
is this secret your own   146.2361154015971
yes said d artagnan till she comes out   57.64760173343568
she is found said milady   180.08449765273434
that your eminence will go at once to the queen   74.10146728942712
he begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him   196.85951984355668
you are very kind   156.49959103160631
afoot my lord   149.56698117617464
that is a large sum   39.671462521433355
my adored valentine words can not express one half of my satisfaction   182.02661714210825
on the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench a book a parasol and a work basket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman standing close to the iron gate endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter   123.85015623157723
with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud   130.7517106521408
when he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head   146.55000628329333
during this storm gondy who had it in his power to make it most unpleasant for the jesters remained calm and stern   216.54977207049689
thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say a throne   127.49754392069894
bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world   113.51278743897035
have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth   165.8827692665125
it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that   158.68982458426433
he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth   111.12147978276766

said porthos opening his eyes in astonishment   123.08417300460367
as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo   217.84152982319353
an hour afterwards they returned   127.4400794522841

my boy said caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating   104.88210814217452
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm   192.36924177025236

did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party my son you have committed a murder   74.67720632975521
i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections   250.29579532673225

on reaching the palace d artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay   183.17682029858344
and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help   42.326628818750805
and the other   150.9487733140318
either you are a demon continued felton or the baron my benefactor my father is a monster   82.43536216090533
the people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them   159.39200028551986
therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by d artagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to d artagnan that he should marry her   127.82240207654306
i only fear one thing   74.23105325481151
what do you want   3.018361087464342
thank god the queen is still of an age to give one   89.38484933930572
this tranquillity proved one thing that d artagnan did not yet know milady   92.2092803115321
ah thanks felton thanks   80.85322085742308
parbleu   20.23179143486665
the assizes the benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation   71.45355408216423
said the three musketeers   114.07782765742967
it was on the thirteenth of july that ventrebleu   172.34146358864257

guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first   142.9614414781998
in crete he was supposed to be slain in winter with the decay of vegetation and to revive in the spring   209.4180060890971
that is all i have to say today   53.22660865465206
he is here   59.82941347219863
nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor   106.84568588113089
said porthos   14.592838873308764
but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire   144.10255778593174
i will have him come in if you really wish it   44.56388659777342
egad didn t you hear   99.55154978844531
standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative   79.61182362631467
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper   112.39929727771566
i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy   96.42628231793074
sure enough   119.80858662564002
the queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which d artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project   173.64861606939238
but do not keep raoul with you   62.00475560869518
bernouin came into the room   92.94518683074378
for third rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it   19.286328739903496
for if he should be there will be really no speaking to him   73.25874113067728
and wherefore   134.8314590295081
the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her   93.39588645326405
i have no time to see them   197.3489307367269
he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to buckingham palace   240.1184087148564
said the young man   82.97510012765609
i don t understand said porthos   165.25395650976517
himself   119.1950696909601
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere   159.85033382954623
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty   119.7124668183095
that is a dream also   14.30647445691595

by all means   99.16043928783161
you surely will not do that my dear count   180.60950618484367
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited   79.2922143229894
perhaps there is but one at this moment   93.16424083221602
milady was there as it were where you sit   101.39731256363271
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him   160.69052711485057
dantès instantly turned to meet him   153.4634360636505
no no dear d artagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis aramis   154.57379507593475
look yonder   132.9308192459739

15 a turkish pasha in command of the troops of a province   115.44049872119085
well   143.95636798918747
d artagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp   141.07935953597223
the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his eminence   155.67285921276937
at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dantès sank again into his seat   67.74105920592294
come tell me   73.10829251908186
whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for him   136.6193626844828
what do you want of me   149.03025727473133
the hangings were of damask the carpets from alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine lady s couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain heaven by fasting and mortification   111.78408645461195
but do this and you will have nectarines and all the rest   106.45427749685464
he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris   189.32025986926013
some insisted she was making for corsica others the island of elba   60.99372811092357
to obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed   125.25941297421735
he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in france   106.71863800669608
de tréville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders   97.18493865421485
if we say one hundred pistoles for the three good for the hundred pistoles   140.6408594641555
chapter lxii   218.5189065272093
villefort walked to and fro behind them   116.60222472156367
yes   189.25866212964695
at length milady could hold out no longer   131.10702735424292
is there any drinkable wine in your tavern   151.31690958371343
and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him   164.5291441063386
when in a house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held secret   165.06639919746902
ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow   179.033912937825
i am sure i am the first cried morrel   6.730623609547052
ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him   116.09493029282982
the elder prisoner pondered the matter   212.25431345758122
hold your tongue you fool   68.3051651740615
there was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression   67.08828356635229
no mysteries no cloak to hide one s self in no cunning policy here   141.74565268766113
at last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before mordaunt had been talking to cromwell   99.78260892323851
yes   91.84463954157255
valentine   168.67430315465387
the count hastily descended presented himself at the already opened carriage door and held out his hand to a young woman completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold   79.02836064196828
friquet   179.97328161289903
the prisoner made no reply   18.250102442268314
it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled   62.8192751961097
let us be the avant guard said he to porthos and find good quarters at saint germain   86.63165700644532
is it my fortune which you find insufficient   122.25748901830688
but it was too late   51.965844783795546
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in france   163.24845424433278

waiter said danglars pen ink and paper   139.8442053245458
probably said monte cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity   157.39775657741853
we at least must keep close to monseigneur   58.02875220032696
what s the matter at the château d if   107.14659146912473
adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat   161.99295967741182
instructions have been given   17.62551220106296
that is all i want   74.41914561171015
calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame   93.84864972933045
king of france who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses   19.53810317527858
madame said the young man bowing   86.06284833966656
i knight you monsieur le comte   120.20563505137218
my lord replied la ramee i think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled   72.3973152643521
at this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor   0.9925466118069011
athos smiled   253.2069180304105
two months said he   189.8186134660615
d artagnan bowed and followed the queen   141.1146784695415
i only arrived yesterday   171.1388217072087
fortunately we have the great cardinal   115.17705433653916
ah   75.11593257688253
said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer   73.90491082167102
she was mad   189.9784306412965
to give them the order to charge and run down these miserable rebels   92.28332737748134
to himself my friend to himself   171.8148945388464
well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued athos in a low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and fainted   102.5417148437907
he only drank from the cask   140.31667907653792
was he not a fine looking man   146.23203573629723
replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest   226.61801182308886
two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm on the rivers of babylon   133.7090293616641
perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight   139.07706109802993
porthos take yours from your holsters   78.71741013583907
the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult   57.1935759487309
then when de winter rose to take leave listen my lord said the queen   116.63838774681663
cried all present with one voice   44.41900716091291
stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me   54.88025692264528
he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty   128.59013128628746
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber   110.77176123244799
bonacieux we shall hear no more   114.34554737329475
monseigneur said he my life is yours   138.94223332564047
ah   135.4476799844719
what are you meddling with stupid   187.1686004624337
it is because you love me   134.66692450548007
the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris   114.05547473091056
why thou art posted here by heaven   85.01339546691344
morrel guessed all this   118.87594033771434
at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten   114.05181603752916
now it is for me to perform my promise   99.44566477680618
when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan   95.95518547872624
de saint méran   147.55265223342764
but no sooner had the man s footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room   159.2841755286463
but m   159.42902568805502
all fell to their knees   171.6983565413603
and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son   128.2117691955223
leave you   124.46738061717652
yes sire   126.40580524207374
albert de morcerf said beauchamp rising in his turn i can not throw you out of window for three weeks that is to say for twenty four days to come nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed   5.526956835020343
d artagnan advanced   86.96490573266806
athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier   94.51799424440735
you will not watch me   145.8512508272312
oh count you overwhelm me with that coolness   203.01984540632304
de villefort has secluded himself   163.95466537327957
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite   131.90452562400952
what do you mean aramis   183.5262852922267
d artagnan s plan was very simple   66.04964422620083
ay that will do at armentières   134.36812898093737
what have we all done then dear grandpapa   90.37698801825861
added he strongly interested in the route milady followed   23.052789283507906
then said athos woe to de winter for the child had done no harm   117.16317368329236
what do you say edmond   78.55383864966069
de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort   196.44074901515657
judge for yourself signor aladdin judge but do not confine yourself to one trial   189.5885651831514
they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men   101.5955187319318
he is called bragelonne   61.70258833701282
madame said mazarin with a smile you may rest easy   243.30615761039405
she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good bye to you in full dress   165.03295538445147
never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams   144.57255564192653
why you knew it porthos said aramis   165.45200274672212
i should release broussel   143.71442436455533
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse   227.2314783277792
at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor   150.30201446317812
then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this can not be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartism i mean about the year 1815   201.86603519557207
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madame thanks for your punctuality   24.915188793450994
the papers had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galley slave   171.8812653134841
ah ah   70.90176013278165
said andrea   33.794629380940364
yesterday s affair must have shaken him a little   145.59431047922124
i have doubtless i am dreaming   206.98194883150046
but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint   140.3022063420446
the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded   231.6035673789904
i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man   217.69902758206152
andrea read in a low voice you are poor   149.2897841447151
the president again arose and having imposed silence said sir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you   78.89692887596955
and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner   165.1963959378935
i declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage   164.31518618131926
here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs   221.1845067966367
and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an ingratitude   89.67663426331758
the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand francs a year   11.699593338387146
and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal   116.48937500160284
oh madame i do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times i am your most respectful servant   136.5404963388903
no one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman   7.9770906402162325
at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus   65.98653162506571
then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself   136.4959384256428
we must not send for a notary but for a doctor   203.99712366048794
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece   17.303616477095005
where is he now   122.72332122208208
monsieur morrel   258.3389732367898
aramis and d artagnan whispered to each other   221.38054917417708
not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories   55.0736404306831
said d artagnan   62.25270462897028
his resolution was made   186.2738850277466
some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation   149.86147584330905
cried mercédès shuddering   90.48319636234221
she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked   181.93639051632402
then what do you fear my lord   284.12766327426107
they brought me that book   52.42339702571627
so that as you confess you are jealous   11.613661945015139
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you   28.206249448974077
0197m chapter 16   134.99552181575132
halloo gentlemen   89.7315825638424
come said the abbé closing his hiding place and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story   83.71291461811418
athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the bill   35.87352348825091
let us pass on to private and personal stipulations   180.50139982033068
cousin german   109.55951567171316
there however ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of rank   90.66758236836455
are you going to give me a lesson porthos   65.64861806101936
lord de winter advanced in his turn   173.60352300078534
i must then remain here   48.952326773589135
tell the truth the whole truth   34.98644199339887
was andrea s first thought   104.67496604686451
that we are not able to say   137.02891429374813
certainly d artagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out   131.04658583469381
but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his enemies   161.36426738664738
but no doubt this man brings me the news i expected   32.78708016848992
no one must disturb us he said   250.4772232990701
a gale   143.51740889461723
well when dantès was arrested monsieur morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad   223.44099270165918
i madame   92.63156583169796
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferry boats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to post paris presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions   196.38426694005219
but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned   77.2186065550458
i should be ungrateful said athos and i regard ingratitude not as a fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse   40.703442506251406
the opportunity was good   194.69035017247654
come count you do not do that young man justice   101.48067684994255
but with that exception i am a good drinker   73.9802689909977
monte cristo was for an instant alone   127.89979837826499
i will call for them   208.87635095532684
he did so and thus doubled his income   187.37120098295077
do you intend opening the door   71.1872141507927
put your names into a hat and draw lots   180.59046803915527
yes   223.611805341659
the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me   91.49687781980758
mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence   97.35982794067363
fernand   182.36565821548461
what i ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my place   93.6589929067297
perhaps i can render you this slight service also   167.52050039228226
general de quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took   152.47219865739612
you know that my means are limited and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions   161.3292950714991
this new attack made no impression on mordaunt   208.37351104106727
he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his pillow   123.89110620758187
waiting for whom   135.99762957839445
good heaven   135.8532352235067
chapter lxi   40.78527327979914
edmond it is not madame de morcerf who is come to you it is mercédès   180.84661437301045
if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through for i never loved any one but you in the wide world   173.37452379966072
then the guilty person is absolutely in custody   12.037459962578467
at this announcement of a battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest   201.3252164612772
said albert do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of rome like lawyers clerks   75.75375678452326
they seemed to understand each other so well said monte cristo with renewed energy   98.80144109109989
what are you doing   155.74900113841673
is that possible my god   97.56250927084064
20043m there s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor   146.85741193679797
not at all   74.86119244309745
oh heavens   137.46221464177566
and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar   175.25674309250522
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore   77.47794911500361
the prisoner turned pale   63.457084625105004
mazarin started   131.68724900750962
allowing his head to sink upon his two hands he pretended to sleep   183.69349084360522
get up   102.31972082846555
the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplices one is mad the other dead   72.38822113000086
warn him as i have warned you   179.72677748313134
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud   129.44704596918632
dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad   115.43054828657905
dantès endeavored to renew the subject   99.90686087098791
50181m the president called for the indictment revised as we know by the clever and implacable pen of villefort   125.61946594238626
monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian   171.57330912301464
he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper   147.3367366823603
they threatened me with torture   252.19893334002552
but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peter s and a month to study it   92.49780600000636
so saying madame de saint méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a son in law s respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been   136.9677456602048
have pity on me count   84.65807280416912
and i very much fear you will go alone to the duke of bracciano s ball   108.43252877769184
father said mercédès stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit i pray you on my right hand   79.62294146358514
a brute that cardinal   28.993159517221088
to ask me if i want money   67.04122952478644
or camille de bois tracy   215.6789485906798
said the baroness half jesting half in earnest   143.5470514871794
felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony   182.48365827917598
upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool leaning his elbow on a table while margotin whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments had crept up to him and had established himself very comfortably between his knees his long skinny neck resting on his lap while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller s face   165.433183158644
in my house murmured he in my house   165.1882323596191
go to my dear athos   104.64164042331765
if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in it   208.9574283346185
lend it to us and go into your house again   157.44715007507673
do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor pastrini with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat   87.43176773196015
ah   168.4015117448848
no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses   225.26897783178111
the sergeant answered that puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket   151.74543993410666
who can answer for that   19.064470962379957
and i mine said porthos   38.23578968929077
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down   296.15213510613285
you no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door   152.4570622020566
are you strong   70.77390548777552
the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold   104.32655445139622
yes indeed   104.1959840908339
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances   49.55453693681707
a horse slips and injures a joint   13.919590347538175
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment   186.32229198722757
whom do you mean   44.51797928285862
do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to sunday morning   195.90126390896486
it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists   87.61690386118745
your fortune exceeds 300 000 francs does it not   168.39198817367492
he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch   90.93125308775737
dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend   155.9173878007253
if we had been five   31.697920106793305
i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him   78.58621290496029
at nine o clock madame la première présidente arrived   193.7828016661045
milady perceived a bed   90.3560944961335
but both remained silent and after a mere bow monte cristo directed his steps to albert who received him cordially   225.84348490657655
d artagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme   148.67930544991958
u   118.36649189293716
it is you sire who have now incurred hers   138.66464865864504
don t deny it   145.48795406155614
true said porthos   102.29140954792496
ah   43.53563065522275
and that the men whom god has put above those office holders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fill i say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation   82.97122053519459
he is a man of from fifty to fifty two years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache   67.25874898444607
this is a boy tréville a mere boy   21.754671988023063
she will buy heavily and she will certainly lose when beauchamp announces the following day in his gazette the report circulated by some usually well informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielle s house is totally without foundation   98.24139227664863
d artagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read it   96.3497343575028
the gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel   38.099860166383806
five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs   231.4615622588235
d artagnan left athos s chamber and went to that of porthos   210.00636947200417
besides should any ill luck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended   38.20272180340875
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus   89.57165690298302
asked mercédès with an angry glance what do you mean   26.593566823706638
involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of noirtier s room where he had seen him the preceding night   23.483960388415326
but of clement vii   129.52501801195646
listen said the count   51.00699857434243
this time you shall not escape me   161.6921140487514
come my friends   170.6897215630834
emmanuel adieu   116.46870286748717
noirtier made a sign that they did   89.72496734518637
he knows them then   125.6219727401784
that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death   115.41256788943309
let them take my fortune i am already too rich   80.60024462339737
make your mind easy   10.145483721596463
need we think of that since we are to save the king   4.079316029828334
all i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there nonsense   4.215838904224256
pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but i had wholly forgotten you   69.30469171713585
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table   39.52858598666792
the jailer came in the evening   178.89858515738433
the prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust   92.4602200986266
open the door then my lord and be so good as to remember once for all that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest cry for help our position being very critical indeed you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities   161.02717580373232
exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail   146.39076211806417
bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantle pieces with flowers   145.7104019013239
he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other   66.05851640089726
but to day is not the proper time   145.56001516662823
demanded d artagnan   83.98093629877948
who would have suspected it   142.1701746203065
my fault   199.669026152289
de monte cristo yields his right of using his   206.33686238962736
what must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silence the cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance   6.742920280985388
asked m   70.65647227969278
d artagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword   145.23440090562337
this room was occupied by dantès father   142.70143802569598
one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him   126.54682423755115
i am called louis the just monsieur de tréville and by and by by and by we will see   75.96224378561409
on what was d artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling   4.526535271939451
listen to me my son has also guessed who you are he attributes his father s misfortunes to you   125.19724422908916
one takes away from him all claim to good sense another robs him of his poetry a third of his originality another of his humor another of his independence of character a sixth but good heavens   41.264102999054856
oh you are a just man   164.32076310535703
on the contrary let us speak of it   220.42259559479504
still further in buckingham s lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised mme   17.80397659626351
why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course   167.6441835450674
yes and that s all settled   124.4095636245157
then put down three hundred livres said the procurator s wife with a sigh   52.66803386389125
for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week   102.30165853559141
asked mordaunt   49.56204903231051
but on my part said milady how should i repay such a service   61.63007273265218
if you make a single step to find her you are lost   234.70101643705533
the citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime   110.00508151296921
chapter liv   142.51583565482616
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith   111.66744221698309
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimaud s shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them   113.05403048426334
what man is that   97.57775138151067
the prisoners are escaping   118.82132738899426
a young and beautiful girl with hair as black as jet her eyes as velvety as the gazelle s was leaning with her back against the wainscot rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor   107.93312284450795
the captain of the king s musketeers   15.241713909488553
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to d artagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly   42.45956582234746
be off you wretch   83.02920869731348
they pursued their way along the quay then called l abreuvoir pepin and went along by the walls of the grand chatelet   125.2874302243981
and five minutes after i left without having heard one word that had passed   86.1914071036152
i am told it is so very amusing   83.51479906726593
on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul   156.424268994822
it was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle   223.65097739573497
ah   130.3174258178
ah ah   20.77530611440804
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices   98.69133504394807
tomorrow then monsieur tomorrow   151.68009103686848
but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman go on home   125.58844631024897
his musketeers proceeded and followed him   142.26415472796575
yes my lord   146.98013108511202
bring your comrades here one and all   55.952408722375544
yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it   130.5726627051063
ah you see that plan was not sure enough   184.6810292824875
but continued monte cristo you are not in your usual spirits   137.57903851040496
do said aramis   79.40349008771162
but he is dead   76.5427538357393
egad   218.5872881934582
at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin s wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and caderousse uttered a cry of pain   75.95062206668683
who goes there   58.73168833851905
what then is there surprising in that   132.34385367101422
well replied milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of impossibilities   149.46549203585016
d artagnan looked much disconcerted   95.0951796419747
it is not true said milady in a tone of voice so firm and with a countenance so unchanged that if d artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have doubted   184.1579757795801
danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word   183.29307072567278
answered m   55.73405788449248
but what does she tell you   48.314366936968426
he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber   190.1818880906962
the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches   96.10538616597091
she knew him   62.17663811424817
and you reply i do not know   169.0227515837564
i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good   171.40179469491494
so much the better so much the better   92.93493833370894
but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings   159.11453052388424
asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm   15.433790175915647
my drunkenness is always sad and when i am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain   149.33403015094592
then i have full occupation for i am so   151.7080933823975
dantès whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others   56.76930091020623
said the boy there s our beadle who is going a journey   5.032546340828773
and i also said d artagnan i also   93.40111417368244
hold out your hand and swear   43.617430609422556
i only make a remark   41.07040682396159
yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said madame de villefort since you had cured the sick   208.6457572025617
good said he as he went away   151.55730735123691
so that i am really so unhappy that i weep   178.91934213894075
you shall have all madame   129.35067183236126
as to porthos that is certainly droll   81.25758592347479
morcerf did not pursue the subject and monte cristo himself fell into a silent reverie   127.5356611009121
hey   169.15012140168227
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them   52.706102143289016
and he returned d artagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at it   75.55521817284952
asked danglars   129.78224430903936
i prize it it was given to my ancestor by king francis i   78.68353515857544
bah let us enjoy that pleasure said aramis with his mild and careless manner   105.18429032076452
monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie   76.14730236560206
my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret   122.42081463274714
how   118.5468628351382
haven t you some one who will relieve me of my horse   87.86094282232631
andrea cavalcanti chapter 57   24.9969465484252
she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain went down the rue mazarine and stopped at the passage du pont neuf   93.8620611186701
one night twenty years ago my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you to armentieres   75.00253687879038
at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide   117.30804825210645
the château d if chapter 9   125.98005563270152
well monsieur said bertuccio this man with this spotless reputation well   213.7008885145642
m   77.8405171474082
and throwing his arm around the young girl s waist he pressed the hand of valentine and disappeared   138.98926933769934
said he   182.60957493525007
he cried   54.710644399842145
upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected   202.9601505562341
one of the gates began to yield   177.336356541962
no count replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general   135.08763954250952
it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the count of morcerf   97.13373767199158
planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his side   125.26957124285957
the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men   159.92355789293242
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength   75.11898503461617
pardieu   191.76334741383252
never mind we shall see   167.90227658119002
yes replied morcerf he said something about it to me   95.34184335154028
but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart   200.32001862908015
this very instant   142.75754275356596
you have restored my courage by a single word   279.77825292259286
now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine   125.68924060850462
the superior education of dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy   186.0665292432009
replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port   125.24789756763984
now only am i fully convinced of being the emissary of god   60.78785635461403
but however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment   178.5314362731042
and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything   81.31589175301343
who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go   84.69729548411291
you shall choose the best   137.83074483888194
he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor   49.09123249378173
i had no longer any wish to live for myself i have lived for him   113.16454025025232
caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès   109.48734031826179
what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian   78.8021716579055
asked athos   114.49233328029266
but he was a man of stone   59.369903070982375
chapter 102   11.241142878278126
morcerf s courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow   173.76897602607892
then raising his sword sound trumpets   72.76171538719512
but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion   168.41864783156836
we have a second bed in the adjoining room   133.8171208300868
the next day athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the act of parliament which summoned the ex king charles i   186.70173026627003
save me i am pursued   174.99753345313178
what do you mean sir   123.58546911595008
the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man   23.456454715931955
in a few days you will be away from this place   98.56534215186967
such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money   75.52646423799229
i finish your phrase   78.50201243445312
yes   237.48975679286877
down with mazarin   219.89973645456092
said d artagnan   82.67689587527354
but asked the sailor where are your companions   125.82503770391838
one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors   30.680978842767473
who stopped him   70.82855742429734
adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of death   137.77301022517048
yes especially if you will show me the poor abbé s room   208.10706453527257
ah   246.47009542768023
suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea bird   159.74032370406968
tis easily guessed   165.34701034675714
they took their places and the ballet began   194.59978693873688
30229m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator   149.05596717843707
i know you even better now   22.15700217148266
what do you mean monsieur   25.821300127647746
sometimes he hoped it could not be mme   46.17475789636072
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick   157.9623563529426
cried planchet   217.4924930379291
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera   168.9299217922218
yes we know that   102.11463405090436
athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword   240.99103072217903
oh   38.192725997161205
is it you baron   112.71652991499313
de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man   86.47659237965229
i think he tasted them one day   214.02828812511297
and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty   168.45323620788957
it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution   113.91509701590238
look at your brother monarch charles i   89.7190887596071
cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety   57.79550845713845
i did not think that was the way of your people   154.26102969869913
oh yes   83.67959067543137
you are master but if you take my advice you ll hold your tongue   44.65455171548126
not nearly indeed   120.65979510274646
pardon me doctor these worldly ideas   166.12243750927806
i was induced to marry her about three years ago although she had but very little dowry because monsieur laporte the queen s cloak bearer is her godfather and befriends her   150.64744851589853
what   152.2224887693295
the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen   186.5780897202487
and then monsieur de chatillon will not come to the place royale to look for you   24.568788144748595
and you sir   134.38967992873782
cried mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left   52.983183696904916
mademoiselle de villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which madame de saint méran took and madame de saint méran is dead   33.24906340389978
but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe   193.73896189290593
and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume   95.14035875360963
this man your highness when he saw me stop before his shop where he has a display of things which would make your mouth water my lord asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the donjon   156.9722382362243
so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss   123.13278830235308
no   132.23659806084922
stronger grew the wonder of dantès who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers   127.86939602615115
oh shall i then again become a fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence   118.23932982625563
ah my dear friend said madame danglars with the same simplicity we before noticed it is a fact   68.76635309008304
vitray said he you will go with all speed to london   113.2571273885119
in the name of that god i act remember that wretch and to spare thee at this moment is still serving him   199.03749984940185
which is not quite the same thing   163.21096522212002
that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny   193.72115918896048
i have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was concerned in the abduction of madame bonacieux   216.76927166946626
after all continued d artagnan there was certainly one with aramis   112.80015413860589
they are coming to meet us   84.62246583810077
f   262.7568269438017
it is extraordinary   88.54487914907617
his musketeer s uniform became him marvelously   218.69074737631246
ah sir you are going to save my life a second time   80.75260278707502
on the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular excavation   50.624868526981544
my lord   138.43519570834138
on the ground floor dining room two drawing rooms billiard room staircase in the hall and a little back staircase   160.71816884744567
one may see that you love your family madame coquenard said the procurator with a smile that was almost tragic   3.795885628324598
finish then what you were about to say   43.789954981837084
as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life   142.29788022846006
hold your tongue imprudent man   12.067835084816323
yes   232.09563808249385
never   181.39267955950834
m   191.89198955563097
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared   110.56951439882116
to old times he said   143.41366290231804
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister   118.60479757491261
said the young girl sorrowfully   174.54294118142383
you know his success our dear duke   125.22914965511654
if so i will give you a letter of introduction to him   30.287885100269392
how do you mean   111.92555359198765
go on i beg of you   150.2761734981987
cried the young man why should you not live   86.76073393845246
explain yourself my pretty sibyl   110.07412212398985
the trial   205.31662619644365
she is very amiable then is she not   85.84824165863397
oh my god my god   77.80923608132585
but monseigneur i know nothing about them   134.65635991478956
and then that which was inconceivable in athos who was always retiring was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society those manners of a high degree which appeared as if unconsciously to himself in his least actions   52.16026137594052
hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of giving myself   152.558647442553
ah yes he said i know them   199.31360385060083
villefort also rang   196.26922561685745
grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger   230.29050560486337
is supper ready signor pastrini   219.46670172961137
villefort tried to smile   95.69893143999161
you tried to kill her   76.93708131166285
the headsman out of the way the sentence could not be executed   111.01853506920432
i understand now why they murdered him   32.04817756424103
ay but it is for the first time madame   155.24875223286475
have i guards   163.9050653257673
murmured charles   188.64261761929276
alas   163.65312063615067
it was a good augury   72.91675157003755
the spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that cæsar a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals   68.64164479663575
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory   161.56716721311014
but all my fortune is in england   184.00063265800185
sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say   99.46423410132428
said beauchamp   217.1272084271585
de monte cristo is our enemy   162.40391472056382
go to bed and sleep   127.78632999360022
monsieur de scudery the author of clelie and of le grand cyrus which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister who is now talking to that pretty person yonder near monsieur scarron   228.61910023727148
the remains of poor renée were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with her   114.12849390102815
he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it   153.31455151903356
during this time porthos played close   142.66664761623636
nay i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands   105.78888479054305
the return   85.84835121575526
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart   73.17081852269007
d artagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other   143.4292424744973
what   105.82632535943769
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard   192.89205678756593
you are in prison then   235.2413221514118
monsieur what i say to you about the matter said aramis is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel   145.70744182306868
why didn t you say so   204.05869957304031
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes   114.19109555520913
then without taking any thought for their future he returned to porthos and told him that his commission was completed   111.47800333745926
he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything   107.81396182690278
40068m speak speak signora said albert i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say   156.1639526826297
then it was to go to her that you left us   125.0498240518906
yes said porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits   205.96336661474794
father said benedetto i am asked for proofs do you wish me to give them   94.52842886629253
but the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the bandit s wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor   245.27367605098763
danglars was quite annoyed by the young man s indifference   101.76638662886154
i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him   73.78935765703461
five full casks   84.2424722615315
we engaged our word   131.643568257437
ah   78.40489316451001
he he   149.36156174782587
she turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded panther   1.594698061275139
really honest men are not so scarce as i thought   135.61101148555824
you drive don carlos out of spain   119.46340520073586
no   113.84658819987105
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped   315.9695656806218
asked the marquis remarking the cloud on villefort s brow   185.55610739724514
and d artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written   161.95543953805077
every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations   74.70044560952235
the officers were full of thanks and took away their prey   203.1672907895569
when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping   243.03353170333236
and the coadjutor and madame de longueville   88.15438034771846
asked raoul   104.55259331486866
the young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him   53.599230845502646
and the goldsmith   64.95578848346554
one might have thought there was in that cellar one of those famished ogres the gigantic heroes of popular legends into whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity   18.09609643477664
oh the miserable wretches   124.08697800636949
bring them here   92.02666223631509
i thank you for the warning said the count   100.80289906661406
athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen bonacieux undergo   145.5262290933311
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship   181.40857380964604
your friend albert de morcerf   157.28759434524218
old pastrini our former acquaintance received the traveller at the door hat in hand   102.80722114826328
you must have time to recover yourself   176.45267598873056
you will hear again from me   33.95875838515221
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted   75.60686671476248
on the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death   265.79517319927515
and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger   67.93055054696822
d artagnan in his fortieth year   208.90198759378018
oh no   39.066156719593366
morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes   76.19201058113893
above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre eminence   111.67124810871044
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him   80.59845428389485
once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance   80.53719765776401
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other   135.9596203060501
my lord have you any commands   16.012635751626732
while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years   130.95242144566822
i will repair it indeed i will my dear porthos   177.67365078855568
of what packet are you speaking danglars   206.9434905235326
so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment   220.05010546278226
for if i am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you   185.14213476726155
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission   125.52588016571039
monsieur de longueville is of royal blood madame said d artagnan   61.421527228832126
do you hear nothing   123.30085279425317
the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand daughter of henry iv   162.7641645721913
that s true   33.151449779752326
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea   137.89420380795332
he knew nothing   129.3697477651849
let your majesty dismiss m   122.14367853204999
exclaimed the gascon surprised   68.06777232032573
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth   197.75925262971492
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber   136.29159924356904
adieu   157.54870717400053
de morcerf s murmured mercédès   124.51963823608779
said aramis to juxon   108.24576310530401
it is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife he has no need to seek happiness elsewhere   93.16788633618386
he had arranged everything for her escape   91.75683404477297
yes said the messenger and i bring you his ring   176.56719798504298
it is olivain who leaves me   42.38130831538203
men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dryly   109.02402909730112
i know the world is a drawing room from which we must retire politely and honestly   164.6889999066224
madame de villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven o clock has just struck and that the trial commences at twelve   158.0837384766811
i am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses me   43.624807511818744
accept this half pistole to drink to my health   178.2543755894088
the gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two fires   18.511845440352914
he is a great commander bragelonne   159.9581151872403
he was going to his banker   147.84836408122092
they weighed heavily upon your stomach   92.54840091096844
no said d artagnan it is in advance   131.29550262037338
he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him   177.1846838626393
la ramee s mouth watered and he returned to the duke s chamber rubbing his hands   111.11335682109572
yes said aramis we have promised   162.21975215846152
who are you   25.065575830993097
no no madame there is no such thing as chance   152.95283334024404
some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of paris   87.51115681682298
he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt appeared   185.8765017259083
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating   166.07645524959187
oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz   78.76994353453267
but i hear beauchamp in the next room   146.70851021495156
fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome teresa   171.0098605215689
you said just now that you had a hundred friends   218.13011587215107
m   126.22573622142657
i shall get them all in time   128.53008283626733
but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk   59.839689456521306
your excellency s carriage is at the door said he   164.79644567616813
imagine to yourself a don quixote of eighteen   61.92792071296471
he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough   179.6245744332169
he entered by the faubourg st   92.70065203852802
said the general   30.41187838460479
soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair   72.04622151956997
recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine   176.3900206863254
tomorrow then sire   161.1028786973455
it was he who introduced himself to us   81.90794256375187
we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it   28.537002323479896
but de winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply   28.555647015060885
bonacieux would have any suspicion   11.456205708544388
but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows   167.7889798479419
aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing   53.18961168512067
bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak side   180.70842327227047
four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich where a vessel was waiting   91.72518638392147
thanks monsieur   265.6084217973887
what the devil do you see so bad in it   117.14609351573786
but are you really the executioner of bethune as these people say   147.60953166196938
the executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat again   99.19066304926798
while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old   114.67710102520891
to the wall   84.378571695277
then there was the ring with the lion s head which cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand   121.3222859674208
sebastian   117.26475346230798
what a wicked looking crooked staircase said château renaud with a smile   96.414145957071
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect   148.3021331128582
no   68.10220219724661
they are destined to produce at least ten   79.90303058252279
laugh then said monsieur de retz   204.21981275742402
oh no replied monte cristo   8.109169311428786
a part of the good abbé s words however were wholly incomprehensible to him   202.44132583174496
yes   52.9982134427196
30043m a quarter of an hour was the reply   96.46527233975557
the name of that port   83.77897779747
the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished   208.66656389606447
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat   178.25821607890708
and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it   100.06964924159925
although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well   88.4879957911107
chapter lxv   88.92981945058682
that s because i don t care to leave you the means of corrupting your jailers   194.51652875965624
indeed the name of bernajoux was known to all the world d artagnan alone excepted perhaps   39.75107875611762
before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you sir   92.97492747401749
truly   146.0582252856838
if i am in fault i will avow the error   7.568457086744289
come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her friend   141.54988871376207
so they said   85.66618652028376
my spirit is willing my head is clear but this demon the gout o ercrows me   141.69409906645814
well then if we can get athos all will be well   94.45567839230813
morrel unhappy   99.10803295134141
and you think she would be angry   54.66062576221901
do you know what torture is   195.85246896834167
no never   75.58156209420338
you know the marquis of saint méran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival   211.21383090110976
a woman of such inferior condition   21.91542420062133
but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything   97.84485189519644
at the same minute one of the little windows of the hôtel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared   123.20582171427583
let us set off   109.9922238520717
20079m alas   117.72985067448406
i have touched the hand of the great man   90.01568467850167
now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness   275.57874828667127
the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris followed by mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm   87.99560659495951
ali is the supper ready   86.17904103063624
oh madame   13.003116172518304
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance   95.92445409915159
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live   79.14042633066137
asked eugénie   34.33112069367934
the precaution of changing our clothes   89.84839656121608
i may sleep perhaps at an inn   121.20095356129191
he then took villefort s arm and at the same time holding that of madame danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantain tree where the shade was thickest   58.38189588417146
said the count   104.0645396834331
besides i long ago determined to put an end to all these petty intrigues of policy and love   186.5268383853197
then your means it appears are improved   164.47988758175183
as for raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in repulsion   86.22746165183369
we traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking   65.8230538295135
only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it   174.37418491696215
by the bye continued d artagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body   198.3876879653743
de guiche who was young and impulsive said to raoul here we are three masters and three servants   101.06714159668572
at them   146.54194810760342
said blaisois   159.32960317222813
but he is perfectly unknown to me   179.81020954895374
the count pretends i have not him to thank   120.92945856414559
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse   112.52912041729795
said villefort with a sneer   52.23104646488105
as ugly   59.60281815640621
but now all is lost   117.34998201267365
at the first word before i had even mentioned your father s name ah said he   110.2097282047942
you are exaggerating athos   8.689475895264309
that is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abbé who may be deceived   8.049703100204553
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification   102.71604377857862
they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances   125.60889337039454
but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time   129.76687373732213
indeed cried eugénie you are very pale   170.5764590157928
though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of harrison and the king   143.30403684292264
but let us return to business   58.62385985927631
her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love   241.94653231117996
my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal   225.99126154377012
as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude   137.1973129585545
and he sighed deeply   95.46611540602714
what do you mean   28.73664916199013
certainly   71.94258435507211
don t be uneasy   139.84493161839455
the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain   216.2826429334977
he rose on the waves making signs of distress   78.59030834267607
the coachman raised his whip   58.2798184288244
it was intensely dark   157.35319856975428
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence   77.92865983050947
if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in   34.09701861127989
i am myself a frenchman   86.42678603281763
then with a sigh poor haydée   24.717006786282553
i desire to know if the confession of charles stuart is at an end   112.47771956293323
monsieur grimaud he told us his name although he does not talk much monsieur grimaud then went down to the cellar wounded as he was   138.57883673987126
but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquired eh   138.131550395299
how can i tell   123.93416421560137
noirtier s eye remained immovable   237.61507226732155
the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way   182.12443003871618
he murmured   14.310549340080513
i think i have seen him three times in my life   173.59773333873795
but have you no groom   130.03446617157385
tis not civil war that disunites us   46.47544287526857
by this arrangement d artagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis   52.96740539586736
and he saw that the complement was not half empty   142.87325331101397
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces   156.6973907782895
tis he   149.9687868569927
he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everything kiosk guards women gold and ali tepelini himself at the first signal given by my father   260.26618617552435
alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore   135.25531466884118
give it to me   30.84949753124883
non siete spagnuolo he said   34.28742086611656
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge   95.97585068376253
sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen   80.02804178016046
said andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me   272.8047870874278
the insult chapter 89   106.12010452783203
a barrier had been placed between dantès and his old friend   105.1593491014674
you lose ground you are turning   75.01637381412104
let them try to pursue him   1.134301275518908
they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate   145.92967473938668
are you alone reverend sir or have you there soldiers ready to seize me   97.10338929529756
and you really understand none of these signals   207.58342839354975
it was seven o clock in the morning and daylight began to appear   182.49100815619914
desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with mme   129.32338598435038
time was getting on however and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert   53.42057202429359
whom god preserve   115.39698633656488
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen   153.60963752471548
dantès drew a plan of the island for faria and faria gave dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure   65.85171998811552
yes i have heard that death is in that house   176.8197090372396
tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything   85.41721958733758
is it not so madame   90.92262979278843
beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us   184.38086802449874
it was this that made me start when you said the other day at m   45.733172714290916
but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second   124.91748845017807
good said comminges   1.2257867119900538
you seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of cross examination   132.7235396101456
everywhere   106.54338224291537
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him   75.06523796528276
said she   155.01259719867642

what are you looking at   142.80540214970262

anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son   206.14808872085035
i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom murmured athos   273.6023810015151
milady read in his eyes love   85.4024671757466
on the contrary i am certain he will do so   131.36518424746905
there he bore the fainting man and laying him down upon the grass unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet   173.7164972764461
dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet   145.46825323409706
ah ah   181.30062774057504

my friend aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your eminence orders an escalade   83.9900034413422
inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution   157.78250978039966
then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he re entered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment   25.68217418997716
we must have a carriage   120.38900495227631
blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne whom athos had christened by the name of his province   93.69112286328388
ah   10.526036522654792

i have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket   8.088117502137266
some of that at the bottom near the laths   130.7135801777169
at the branching off of the road toward paris aramis who had followed in the cardinal s suite turned back   239.70538160633367
nearly nine years   25.485835863104015
she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter   190.02974280066917

well for my part i shall go to bed said d artagnan   51.032317451659395
yes that s it no doubt   92.65821551852359
it was a long time before i was able to make out what place i was in or to take account of the details i describe   9.173010266480901
i ask but one said the king   32.76518144977602
asked mademoiselle de saint méran with an air of deep interest   187.03107914241843
but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands   43.698613097750155
with some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of lansquenet   201.53078014620152
my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he can not tell you   88.650404539457
yes who was hanged   176.5988476117966
with whom can it be if not the duke of the duke of yes monsieur replied the citizen giving a still fainter intonation to his voice   134.6068477053443
cried the gascon do you think athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and aramis   215.71012757412905
d épinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract then you have my promise maximilian   179.82264486924228
but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep   150.2436419469941

people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world   57.07959231100825
so said charles he who knocks down there is the comte de la fere sire said aramis   168.45780034472858

we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine   50.63833074648308
the number of lights had been intentionally diminished but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days   118.3840464209953
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m   188.5639464590994
the lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port   158.81149302150985
to your eminence   117.55901121170221
tell me why does a steward rob his master   126.24400028811691
cried the gascon and porthos   71.2528478620198
but i doubt if it be his real name   156.52423611354774
but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the world   150.1873626268868
but that is not all   201.2042448608771
teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing room   34.41404992520661
and i have come at once to see you   183.19267057992656
you are dressed   68.24051427803009
but of course it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you   151.0943008299583
the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and deep   38.74499930443663
you understand tréville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all   229.6418623111594
i think not sire   125.59987809244286
a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor   114.87320143685362
the sergeant called his two patrons with an energetic hem   34.99547980242322
the catacombs of saint sebastian chapter 38   183.68404436304198
as to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its disappearance   176.89864324249072
and who knows it   113.53781370319253
d artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation   106.41783737294217
what did it taste like   77.22762278773162
truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house   122.29462885343673
no   162.69244717180752
england needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king   55.92059161118722
and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him take and keep this ring in remembrance of me   5.104092233744495
albert wrote to request me to come to the opera doubtless that i might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you   119.51974722831487
is what true madame   83.93511915997865
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellow the true type of a duenna or a devotee   69.41052533073695
will you speak   174.18998104757642
athos   133.14231142546512
yes here in this convent my dear fellow   156.95728172933332
what do you want sir   153.67072307898698
there are special reports on every prisoner   74.94721370428005
it was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short summer   90.08462790741916
this league was directed against france   143.04262735555503
i have become simple in my tastes and am without passion i hope   176.5665795334399
you told me yourself that that ring that ring i have   157.19203901901653
said d artagnan   157.02023842388638
he has the right to notice nothing   129.9912693984038
0327m so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbé   135.80256748982296
la ramee went out   79.86912026921812
parry resumed his reading   195.70642746650338
today is the 5th of september is it not   149.6288178522592
bah   77.31723304644001
cried mademoiselle d armilly whose pity returned as her fears diminished   7.571691113426795
the timely arrival of d artagnan in paris   66.02320435294929
then i wrote   82.67400305277309
the past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance   177.42657748085318
yes sire   95.92435824081159
inquired the abbé of caderousse   166.57478975832498
and as what i say and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to dantès the worthy dantès look here   138.22549786353846
ah   276.9650965356251
and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit   89.92021100923259
it is quite remarkable enough   136.23141560759376
in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege   144.62671827834072
enchanted monsieur said mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows   149.2905272003561
there is no drawing back   64.62036913514953
blaisois went with him   97.25527337504462
ah indeed   111.99902555243793
said morrel   143.65959729196533
well   222.27919188398786
these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom   84.19996505811113
d avrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemist s to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughter s room   47.22472721231789
are we then going to travel my lord   61.000337856889686
chapter 61   42.688895297485644
the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant   84.35426170490001
an hour afterwards luigi vampa was chosen captain vice cucumetto deceased   77.73968060022949
before leaving the scaffold aramis had approached the opening where athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king   197.32330287580663
very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to me   82.26056290123452
yes count and charged with a commission for which i beg of you to accept my excuses   129.28918896011393
the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered   141.22874133639996
it was in fact mordaunt whom d artagnan had followed without knowing it   160.6504641076171
34   123.41097832574546
poor concino concini   19.51530595890202
go   142.92639024185252
return then at five o clock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you   103.05669018865197
well   154.78195132585273
answered the englishmen and the frenchmen as with one voice   46.949518575612714
when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue   160.06825101176983
inquired d artagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief   55.49608423171234
moses the servant of god he was but a servant please to understand moses blessed with the hands   150.10363121352103
i will give in my resignation as captain of the king s musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal s guards and if he refuses me morbleu   165.2064373763059
tender hearts   67.05223799935352
did i know anything about it when it was all done when i was down there   123.8800803910759
warn his friends too   96.85768741689347
smiling as he uttered the word   117.78916280401675
when he had finished with the orange tree he began at the cactus   101.11348450681572
nevertheless he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front advancing   74.6347755043422
and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle   22.325451371603023
these studs can not be trusted to anybody   56.35699103383699
noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attention   198.67339627171543
yes madame   40.25948593586753
he extended his hand   173.99910440622415
in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not   126.12979253671317
chapter 50   60.94082131480891
all is over   126.37759891170536
in recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that raoul might suffer   242.44138770078388
20107m one evening a wolf emerged from a pine wood near which they were usually stationed but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead   157.74815259174034
continued athos the poor abbé was not a st   172.55821428961207
porthos bowed to the cardinal   217.0280477388436
besides we must try our own arms   47.09235136827539
he is really dead   136.971664689323
it was indeed aramis   145.87980040407004
danglars thought dentro la testa meant put in your head   66.0118607959234
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos   150.4854743066552
these are doubtless your family arms   12.961599386963144
truly murmured valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not   83.36348677874773
what   183.15010665129185
monsieur does me wrong said planchet   123.73528105202261
oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit suicide   157.354840727409
a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes   238.72775086329227
to no one by heaven   191.22259574634012
you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort   160.63503845267888
it could no longer be doubted   152.73740806026828
mercédès read albert while showing you that i have discovered your plans i hope also to convince you of my delicacy   91.20449230301143
you hear major bartolomeo cavalcanti a man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of italy whose name dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of the inferno you remember it do you not   163.71905211268393
if i knew that he did i should know all   107.41145373161778
to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor   94.25938085187873
a magnificent cavalier remarked mazarin   85.73148672954272
20193m chapter 37   76.54717583085252
i will say two words about it to the cardinal s esquire likewise   122.55343205103216
asked mazarin after a moment s silence   198.77359820709938
nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear   158.15839538700845
bring here immediately the king s attorney m   60.4863543988969
after the reward of his devotion that of his love was to come   189.09868786935715
the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a chisel   187.53583515757094
and she is not to be despised in my opinion   69.35275368330606
sir said he to the priest i shall keep this cross in my hand till the last moment   156.27459499094385
otherwise all the world would be poisoning each other   140.459642231466
your son says he requires money   101.4312333234055
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten   118.30862626606499
i shall be happy to meet you again sir   121.2471581504925
why as to that i think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country   32.23071985880165
who   149.62460831919128
noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation   58.66722247494723
the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me   93.5846961117729
said milady with the utmost ingenuousness   147.8339456733185
he now arose his head bowed beneath the weight of grief and shaking his damp dishevelled hair he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes someone by whose side he might weep   75.72919951831034
i rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour and a half and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made the tour of the place st   152.45034333319464
have you killed the cardinal   79.8339034003429
all hands lower the mainsail   25.999074609918836
but such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal   119.2760394503948
haydée s nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers nay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence   80.63116105656643
yes but i know also that monsieur le comte de la fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that olivain should return to paris   195.1253559367471
no monsieur be silent   97.98306633276962
now said the gascon that is all well i accept for porthos and myself everything thanks and compliments   10.801982431511846
in the morning it was rumored that prince de condé had evacuated bethune and fallen back on carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former city   181.8122073207873
he is not a gossip i hope   141.47785497462945
that may be madame   87.30254045012013
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars   116.80451694856424
you are monsieur d artagnan   191.61545524769832
you furnished a principal of 100 000 francs   202.50226711025283
asked she   189.05167824823576
if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three francs will be given you instead of a diamond worth 50 000 or perhaps 55 000 francs   58.70786075420307
and when i am gone you can open to him   221.8853288909208
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago   57.28388873825567
the patrol was heard passing to double the posts   179.6173820530837
franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of bracciano s   13.041398576443896
why so   127.38690496332529
i recognized him when the wind blew upon his cloak   179.14121517130573
tell me mouston said porthos are my arms in good condition   76.40044067268991
i hear a horse   165.22055047921236
dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellow sufferer to share his supper   54.24967400761617
that s true replied d artagnan   140.59300238709852
and 100 000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much   127.93092028432075
she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle d armilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow   109.05681154009167
the men and consequently the women are but shadows and love is a sentiment to which you cry fie   87.23711375508996
shells   19.59888894765365
well   92.32297595874172
replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming   115.78024970073847
he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread   98.20462550111225
i have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood   52.875019891212034
but did you not read that i must be alone   114.27574097796123
you m   98.08986338192511
one could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death   62.24635881029443
you make me young and happy again by it   108.01750980758396
will you allow me father   161.4792222643973
to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting   59.18094074450561
think of the offense you have committed toward me madame   152.42521317278374
he would no longer be alone   62.116761178061616
come here sir said urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns   1.5872522548508528
and who is the countess g   54.80473050216518
you are a singular man said villefort   13.926731951195904
at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away   7.7333448438578785
well then i don t know   64.20153620592455
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m   173.3516812573779
they were in earnest conversation   53.12802886546963
these two men were the executioner s assistants   144.11715849647683
certainly   141.91589237082556
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers   177.37830379862402
but we will be fair players   115.73203846253855
the frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queen s consent to it   55.281137433868714
two one here and one there   69.23736021032612
it is running now   179.6057897440445
in an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back   162.60489160256168
valentine said the count summon up all your courage   154.199134851362
the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father   97.33735302240567
two hours passed thus   160.3950915976481
but happily there is a postscript   74.14610626976372
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity   43.76195918743461
each fish was brought over in a cask one filled with river herbs and weeds the other with rushes and lake plants   66.81978149729449
for the decision does not come from you your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes   134.44107763855172
why about ten or eleven o clock   112.56003409184606
one arm was hanging out of the bed   87.31782699392444
said château renaud phlegmatically   91.09404706707302
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1   90.35938999496719
what do you mean   91.54050249103197
said d artagnan with his wise smile   49.307185203823664
chapter lxxxviii   139.15426768380493
and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know   155.86513438692492
he first kills m   203.78648813551789
monsieur de tréville is ill so my company can t do without me   190.74802350320982
that is what all the french say returned signor pastrini somewhat piqued   127.80689639594196
indeed you could not belong to him   131.05594261216697
well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a better   126.10430276788021
de tréville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment   137.5888916149968
porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m   237.92743946375006
i am at present in the midst of war and am about to deliver a decisive battle against king charles   131.7645945229322
but there were three races were there not   66.89128262698021
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom   15.309989720656802
d artagnan shrugged his shoulders   163.54377807878575
then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twenty five years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist   126.10434940179161
it is impossible   111.08415418982159
you are sure there is nobody there   77.06315649610141
i merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelle en serval   151.55222256374125
franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent   123.91127222713304
on whom do my hopes rest   129.62033312220493
porthos aramis and d artagnan followed his example   114.41448279388523
understand sir i do not in the least suspect your veracity   139.95298694501332
it is the son of milady said athos to d artagnan   90.02839410884937
with a post chaise and valet de chambre   104.190796182969
and another servant entered   170.84038143264877
that paper must be torn to pieces said d artagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of death   214.435572127321
count said albert in a low tone to monte cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her history   108.52634621710975
athos followed them then porthos then aramis   63.61273794204144
i now understand why you are in the service of cromwell   3.507836986332933
said albert   188.30288628047674
i draw upon him for 600 000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400 000 francs payable at his correspondent s in paris at the end of this month   75.60564777183876
another reigns in her name   90.07764582554384
just under us   259.9362896683142
danglars as well as the rest   216.60953664464216
he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him   84.5221941317331
and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him   107.81720325518421
to whom   180.82394320135063
we will spend with him a guinea each per day   3.690831838826071
the queen can not you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess   81.82139619927361
the devil   116.90547393660619
ears have they but they hear not   55.87814170472948
has not your excellency heard that the french chargé d affaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri   83.30180575630833
my dear lad that was yesterday when i was telling you silly stories it was proper to tell me that and not this morning   153.99110421803096
father and son chapter 3   55.47639961240032
have you brought your arms   137.1898572387913
upon your honor   144.14759065627615
sign the liberation of milady de winter said felton holding out a paper to the duke   87.06734216555537
no pardieu   136.47771886650554
she had recognized the voice of d artagnan   131.17085208495894
but instead of adding if your succor does not arrive within fifteen days we will surrender it added quite simply if your succor comes not within fifteen days we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes   1.1966765303739066
break off their acquaintance   163.58703230712106
you only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son   137.04781412195874
de morcerf   150.49379095272263
conscience what hast thou to do with me   75.94197795455602
at the queen s last word d artagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery   119.64251792254198
demons do not die so easily   91.51085086310471
no one has seen d artagnan and porthos has not appeared   173.19542643493153
there is constancy   132.11869491156642
that you inherit from your mother   128.14323781307192
dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock   115.67143751633797
monte cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured here beneath this plane tree must have been where the infant s grave was dug   76.29558686636267
an englishman you say   116.55656588470741
neither could give the others any information for all were ignorant who this man could be   109.28142460878001
and we are even a little uneasy on what account   137.15908731065065
asked madame danglars   92.88999471073114
you did not see   12.930528033903556
how   7.370843873906679
not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman   69.64956790405833
if you let him go i am a dead man   144.4305108971119
i thought i did replied athos   113.63248080417256
he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower stands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle piece the countess s smelling bottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered my dear mother have you been ill during my absence   185.4614219351751
this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing italian duets with cavalcanti   128.99712663395312
you are right   121.60396052326125
it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays   188.160895784528
and i too he exclaimed in a low voice i unite with m   93.02239084290593
athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it   91.13993203185842
the place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions d artagnan had conceived   96.25674625556609
asked beauchamp   113.81326439814583
however he added turning to porthos i should not regret dying sir were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you   124.16543061094282
that happens every day   228.18441492981668
these steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards appeared   274.4286371455356
monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when pistache would have learned a few new tricks   122.92853032525518
the duke smiled with bitterness   191.92852168428118
certainly   180.63771232697218
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself   94.463757851931
i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole   60.25892963865813
he has foretold many things which have come to pass   54.99334474547457
40179m you think then all is not over yet   113.18539095943487
he had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not   139.05091858739635
edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard   98.23713966083103
in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days   183.42432448081246
what a proposition   150.43700259022947
crown pieces only silver pieces   111.59639204423846
then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister   176.36521210728793
amen   317.8884906243388
what a wrist you have reverend sir   242.0850676714154
p   177.1724233505546
who must be now about forty seven or forty eight years of age   22.169083599297224
noirtier for it was indeed he who entered looked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents   40.44846369784905
i don t know   79.9155028281396
meanwhile she is not very wretched   64.01715559256574
where were they taken   142.29817249447962
my lord said d artagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i can not miss   113.46549045802362
she cast a glance at the door   25.66084035118203
and he had five millions in your hands alone   148.1654763400504
d artagnan overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk   78.38493972742958
in no instance let us say was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions   64.90050039484014
but i must warn you that we have no time to lose   42.19322503300981
come my dear bazin tell me where he is   106.17209937352757
an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health   33.91186344272835
said beauchamp much surprised   150.1942613112851
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port   205.7869998430004
listen madame and recall your remembrances   181.0170840810386
but the carriage and horses   211.51386177814362
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort   185.0562819988602
oh nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor   124.89300192259836
is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion   63.65804774774611
demanded the concierge   175.9785826037579
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country   69.8675937107228
epilogue la rochelle deprived of the assistance of the english fleet and of the diversion promised by buckingham surrendered after a siege of a year   141.82783363469628
said the englishman   41.150953359985266
asked the young girl   124.7754889929324
an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death   92.87729327716158
speak to your mother open your dear eyes and look on me once again   142.51661431325695
alas said d avrigny she is indeed dead poor child   54.08075266678161
i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him   181.39990259992294
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy   135.50169400217797
the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel   48.04663359966821
you are tempting me you make me doubt the goodness of providence it is impossible it can not be   146.7329889094544
come monsieur come   45.65743480954592
as for me i will give my last sou for it   225.30147844944617
never mind it for i see you once more said the old man   106.56067381565123
the gascon is the devil   236.05524560711996
who goes there yourselves   146.64508777896327
do you see that street   143.204611985494
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom   88.2846725808309
in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the cross roads   136.98915464673195
i wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday   132.85916558397264
milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vertigo   148.02352393508264
but what are you going to do until this evening   205.9977666810919
he is gone   163.3500514867306
at the end of a passage paved with bricks was a little garden bathed in sunshine and rich in warmth and light   43.81715484341561
i love the sea as a mistress and pine if i do not often see her   46.21379111680588
he reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the wine   114.07661990617571
or at least i will go later   165.38296359504716
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him   98.74643419879808
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count   169.9249078247412
tell him i beg you that i am his humble servant   120.16010260889826
asked the young man   184.9436597055036
but when i do obtain it well   133.76775078319181
silence prevailed for an instant during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture   204.5459473910061
the baron came forward   106.01113175520625
bazin bowed low sighed and left the room   152.36080777180533
franz d épinay and she shall marry him   166.92218826614638
d artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king s musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place   10.223721102682148
chapter 58   176.83225554036537
not worth speaking of   81.47316220226386
yes   72.40116922813345
it is a wretched damp nay even horrible spot more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron bars   135.36283590277796
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect   72.94445806237181
happy beyond measure   88.81771814113085
and if i lose   123.85351587405898
i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers   259.9077450690515
franz to provoke him and to fight with him   49.851398369555525
he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty   200.3534909855354

the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient and locked the door was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the king s attorney   81.33707606683669
days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course   188.47743769645686
however sire if i might advise your majesty will interrogate the person of whom i spoke to you and i will urge your majesty to do him this honor   83.19126774736151
did parliament pass this act   77.43340744274096
do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love   115.63261306839335
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it   176.76282090020868

and then he was older than any of us added d artagnan   109.13898409005473
oh unhappy woman   109.2082969403055
bertuccio interrupted the count   59.66037867288521
however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen   234.84551519645552

gondy raised his hand and demanded silence   29.590516517753528
cæsar and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little   157.92028615135177
we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said athos   172.80551338539476
i stooped to examine it was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet   174.0666037281104

exactly so   171.92992055774417
50281m morrel opened the letter and read my dear maximilian there is a felucca for you at anchor   124.5954683639017
that is all i wished to know said the queen   88.49935451936972
nothing nothing only shut the window   48.018506301638126
i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred   82.28243541760114
yes monseigneur replied the officer   141.51237099371158

do not do so reverend sir   58.99088217092392
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and d artagnan turned to him   67.18401687419444
the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited   52.33325078866285

you are a man of the world are you not   27.672878578067696
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men   207.71939474120185
inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation   101.63528175713881
reckoning still further that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house i shall never speak to you about rent very kind   78.89336798647386
your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting   202.13104796039056
only fernand   131.08161140894092
this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe   134.02696045050595
ah   228.10305068054657
say at once you disapprove of my proposal   167.96328370734122

the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries   99.83418406267148
well   140.9730353492628
but i have been taught my mistake   101.05365603790526
enjoining in case of disobedience on his part all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him   164.3672180000843

a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity   146.19947343993908
that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron   98.28982205174603
but m   61.28266650910714
replied the swiss   103.38232262711999
but madame morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper   122.4108205521713
and being strong and vigorous he soon got him on the broad of his back and placed his knee upon his breast   17.475194101447286
it concerns nothing less said d artagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the queen   142.0823193282118
d artagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart   123.64751035506636
it was your granddaughter then was it not   53.58394439911394
exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically   83.05873691659434
heir   210.90625525189049
and i am the more grateful to your eminence replied anne of austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his majesty   140.23968652295673
to be sure   208.36845518538132
danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dantès   112.00560072396662
the particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance   117.99139919341283
yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four hundred   52.122815966657754
my dear count we have only just begun   114.00388100992888
will you this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances   102.81061923140183
but the wind was contrary the sea bad   98.37654632128809
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission   141.72670460091368
his look alone had spoken   110.85325009408126
your stairs are so polished it is like walking on glass   265.0067890108693
d artagnan picked it up and offered it to lord de winter   71.01614981510087
but athos might be said to bear a charmed life   227.3936961304126
albert de morcerf   131.36810971927432
ah   135.21421379009868
at that moment aramis entered   79.24070370285594
and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture   98.26583109653657
said athos   53.83582645124697
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market   54.346488422317144
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m   202.43417541616662
perhaps by the time you return to paris i shall be quite a sober staid father of a family   146.09672210154739
you are punctual said he as he drew back the door   152.42710839618604
patrick uttered a loud cry   261.77905332624437
a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed   122.26188581644007
0335m there you see wife said the former this splendid diamond might all be ours if we chose   184.76687694156277
must aramis do as much as i madame   88.51182111978947
continued the king without directly replying to de tréville s question   48.12838021957397
well next some day you will be robbed   115.10022056358463
he has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself sinbad the sailor and has a cave filled with gold   119.65136397318004
a skilful preparation of my friend s the worthy abbé adelmonte who taught me the use of it   40.360900716310155
he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint méran s death recurred to him   131.65606887896928
do you really mean you would go to his house   151.94170202509446
i have found already   134.0259055120381
and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle   211.1362976071337
the officer waited for his reply and seeing it so long coming he burst into a laugh turned upon his heel and re entered the house   166.73346866354635
said valentine   208.24754497263794
she was asking pardon for her sins   211.0999001536556
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new bridge   92.74309547978424
i want recommendations and some information relative to africa   191.05549266784416
really   115.21210430861035
i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such   190.69621438508358
yes said athos by his own nephew   88.98815110739272
but outside your orders there is a service you can render me   96.06305161829097
do you hear   134.9401365253549
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room   63.38655758615148
rueil was crowded with advocates presidents and councillors who came from the parisians and on the side of the court with officers and guards   122.29107818973314
by this smile m   65.43229879999961
the queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice   136.8784366130169
i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded   45.34637381877597
indeed   148.17069118322888
what then   115.55595496674636
and villefort with his papers under his arm and hat in hand directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife   165.6886471506885
what a fine plain for partridge shooting   201.5918325539219
yes my lord   196.55047792841413
d artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt   125.87332236937404
the other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending   35.29585485149997
and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king   239.31416796081072
interposed laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle   61.71842911918086
upon my word said caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of dantès united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantès good fortune upon my word dantès is a downright good fellow and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be   96.72180149459774
the abbé was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day   170.70422185947632
the same as usual my dear my glass is there on the table give it to me valentine   134.27885834422804
m   141.37622675334288
it was dark and silent as the tomb   158.9066701206224
but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son s life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young man s heart every feeling of filial piety   93.13997705055587
i accept it interposed d artagnan proudly   177.45223932576943
he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in m   76.75317987919345
don t let him escape   63.21008709714569
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection   49.67812651746425
poor woman poor woman what have they done with you   81.15744278372222
himself who took a pride in being considered a past master therein   32.16584802656578
the young man s finger glided over the words but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign   98.12490444870105
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation   210.11890832816673
vampa in this attire resembled a painting by léopold robert or schnetz   13.29686920287574
said the queen blinded by her obstinacy   122.6424278161005
gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet   90.53430489658774
de morcerf will not raise his voice against us   2.7845638205198497
i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces   125.10294578886072
then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès   139.90569026160458
playing the day before   117.87290604748046
and he went right to the prisoner   27.82055434729824
the lightning answered the captain our felucca   46.24160450079226
which way   80.25686460635967
valentine uttered a cry of horror   68.88216327738238
and you say that dantès has gone to the catalans   121.57025032747428
d artagnan took a pen and wrote madame until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor   47.315309194797436
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria   61.84635219298476
the marquis de saint méran i think the concierge said   156.59392215032676
a fine pleasure indeed monsieur   215.7222396598077
then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters   109.64693661199252
therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly   176.22543313843488
certainly monsieur   46.75484971271649
and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful   72.77257052878565
i don t speak of my brother   64.93266437755605
your honor   57.992150515141816
it means that i have just returned from yanina   125.86004493251819
if bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape   146.76943249662023
dantès had spoken of mercédès and villefort instantly recognized her   173.33043355512896
in case of a check mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything   44.19772492064243
e   26.916883350179205
dantès fell on his knees and prayed earnestly   4.284347723960025
but she she was very beautiful   51.56989079472751
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur d artagnan say a great deal about them   73.72540040167972
present yourself at the wicket of the louvre on the side of the rue de l echelle and ask for germain   158.3535766920856
the procureur dropped his head   119.87157182852128
it was in the name of comte de wardes   75.87776850332571
you who have arranged your infernal plans and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous   120.90750724138117
and yet cried porthos we will not leave you will leave d artagnan to act as he thinks proper said athos   188.35229708003567
lightning darted from his eyes   133.27363062669392
though you should awake and be ignorant where you are still do not fear   35.923519518809755
has the gascon been indiscreet   149.4916094394659
said the major gravely   155.02399248577487
certainly   43.88746614424201
i shall not leave my grandfather that is an understood thing between us   110.88028333154703
monte cristo returned her smile   222.44577326382577
exclaimed haydée   107.29671182338127
come   230.4283329988014
said d artagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts athos i can not imagine how you can talk to us in that way   95.23021716628202
the count withdrew his foot   99.62987206565485
by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill fortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son the count at last exclaimed folly folly folly   121.86711450419678
permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours   66.70951050654014
it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen   197.82422998958438
it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino   149.88264171504437
my lord he said which way do we go   129.36259004262635
come come sleepy head   128.6176269427136
now said albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are   218.23014967098686
all was vain   11.428424057833013
chapter 22   193.54429561427816
had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did albert s declaration   197.64218994739986
and all this because he had trusted to villefort s promise   105.49769077796367
such a beautiful woman   209.82220836263878
the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror   48.041780140723844
i will never help you in that monsieur chevalier said kitty warmly   208.61584141397475
it is not you who should apprise m   49.462226540634916
where   86.99667752513365
you are a capital companion d artagnan said he   257.0945081921045
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited   227.02814499813317
grimaud and i got behind a tree and the scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the road   78.06378027327477
it contained a few poor articles of household furniture a bed a table two chairs a stone pitcher and some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the count recognized as sweet peas and of which the good man was preserving the seeds   16.114135313583233
i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask   125.9018973692647
well go down to her then to make your request   149.68464718222612
once outside he and planchet set off as fast as they could   70.73979426759976
oh exclaimed morrel with a glance full of bitter reproach do you think it possible that i could be   100.33755206574081
but she is built to stand any weather   94.77851316832346
it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion   132.29735342553056
all his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter   103.64095055413861
but said morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalities of releasing him from arrest   72.49787437719546
monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned   64.95571298715066
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered   93.62609994625619
the two lower rooms consisted of a dining room with a table chairs and side board of walnut and a wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or timepiece   131.09353951478397
and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother   220.42861071752995
the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres   51.8461130503116
mazarin bit his lips as he spoke   164.85226508864315
it was like a besieged town   44.96470955039068

chapter xlv   191.43838223647987
you hear him   157.07381174441926
the swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale   125.40354881577778
what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself   138.27492745130948
you are most kind   185.12942006298297
as we were sure of finding him there we left him alone   179.42827537916764
oh i am done with considering   127.93053438344523
will the queen deign to follow my advice   204.42897346848457
we owe nothing to our enemies   207.84542052884623
the hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table   108.72032334910548
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young can not resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching   163.29179238947117
they quickly went downstairs   166.0870828007001
said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in darkness   113.23001469711457
mousqueton is here then   33.80216837191776
what are you saying to her   129.0393227014126
ah indeed   170.6703517517296
said the queen ironically   150.67267057703594
yes if you have nothing more to say to me   116.2922888347945
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham   173.33613017261828
said porthos   87.91695476272513
immediately the door opened and the superior entered   226.30698882410493
oh if he knows the contents of this   153.18743746234193
indeed   199.44371701181998
chapter xxxv   78.0901346078879
one of the noble peers who was familiar with the arabic language having studied it during the famous egyptian campaign followed with his eye as the translator read aloud i el kobbir a slave merchant and purveyor of the harem of his highness acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor from the french lord the count of monte cristo an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand francs   42.74713070707148
i have during those five and twenty years spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me   42.37341241395315
the patrol passed   129.97715871217687
coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things   114.80486982176724
well cheer up   34.95212652569499
oh no   117.1799809078048
to leghorn   156.54769265908752
absolutely   179.27087638595822
i went on first fortunately   15.01680417911055
he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself but i must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guards an appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers   52.044922945338556
cried the citizen   65.84779348940897
lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near   145.12792155731046
franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows   179.36851719087102
she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate   108.52815636183716
he made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside him   106.65828537802469
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue   90.03303832943115
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way   136.9034842842038
these two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing d artagnan on the coach box of the royal coach   137.9720974410414
when i have none i go afoot   168.52730781525057
henceforth valentine you will never again be separated on earth since he has rushed into death to find you   112.7336126951143
and i about ten pistoles said aramis   67.60872937791153
the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day   197.29508198792348
i confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance what do you think of this   93.28211760852221
you saw your wi hush   232.4221726730054
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer   39.08125512956617
if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not   44.061664452777734
you know anne of austria   26.124415698603002
and since i found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate to be close to you without really seeing you have i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength   119.4258395102555
i would have given 10 000 i would have given 20 000   102.85362283932757
tell us news of yourself as often as you can   56.41357475077537
the sounds drew nearer   116.10762155501395
i can not wait till tomorrow   161.95155498872532
i will leave you the torch sir   146.7748186153191
you wish to ask for liberty and i give it you   87.46260812003644
he was going to throw the crawfish out also when grimaud snatched it from his hands   168.5109928642922
mine host s face does not please me at all   179.65368137613893
he cried   76.92941877863657
i have happily only myself in the world to care for   165.54345254726888
then caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder   220.52680232768313
almost immediately bazin came downstairs   127.7927725430191
flourens in consequence of the rabbits cats and guinea pigs they have killed   246.58066475157287
did you ever meet him previously to coming hither   2.5560742943060433
thank you thank you murmured she   110.48001594321947
exclaimed everyone   67.41440733496388
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo   122.64726622802573
listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well   127.01534691537434
how much do i owe this gracious prince   214.52208874168943
i will tell it cried milady with a feigned exultation on the day when i shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith   53.34987659851338
and he listened toward the quarter indicated by d artagnan   116.00188724254566
mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance   101.35232220000226
yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that   106.53681052525967
pray d artagnan said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside   47.90430747614131
if i had anything by means of which i could inflate the lungs said d avrigny looking around him perhaps i might prevent suffocation   145.93738728538187
you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us   107.52283348252303
i resisted   132.80683799289886
and will you make the same promise to my love   186.0691867998205
but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend   151.9438995659154
sir interposed blaisois i warn you that i can only swim in rivers   209.80666146808016
the street of saint honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day   85.91404974272345
he resembles the old conventionalist of 93 who said to napoleon in 1814 you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth   101.85072124079426
and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject   198.24415481550534
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them   186.32383326918162
there was a moment s silence it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body   16.176728400097602
then athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin this temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events   64.58611269706836
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him   61.86404166455433
cried d artagnan   190.69874469965055
let us speak candidly sir   124.12110958025623
the prisoner s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom   166.66074941928431
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me   81.62234660712667
this movement revealed the spot where winter s body had fallen   118.28398496628394
having made this well turned speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court   239.5196512780287
gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left   140.93630776992947
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg™ work   94.3239347967741
said aramis   229.17576109996867
a true friend s eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me   122.48017196463191
he had been informed at seven o clock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle   163.81236714896212
false gentleman   21.322441219241597
he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet   29.664689496058102
i am weeping with joy   163.32770464097217
there you must rest   196.8716355075518
in the meantime d artagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette   172.30377259457342
the curate then entered followed by planchet   89.37703830988745
the house of thomson french had 300 000 or 400 000 francs to pay this month in france   299.38684459063484
he was calm and radiant was he not   123.7022849508842
here   171.967108664911
said the president   45.208702056455195
no one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers   61.29221331944898
still more must be done   42.007772818908435
it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmond s admiration of him   75.34870397706324
d artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets   56.572215344187924
8   90.37271769048036
i got such a fright last night replied dantès smiling that i have almost lost my memory   84.82370212157693
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared   34.889433980578275
send him away and all will then be well   118.80726350268787
what is it sir   50.09403495361558
and your present happiness has it softened your heart   143.7058053711995
said caderousse   100.76247672113948
so much the better   75.59615268873316
the young men first approached the dead man   94.52121652917346
then you believe the papers   87.811129801487
chapter xii   82.30006742598901
you have one at heart aramis one deeper and more painful a wound made by a woman   29.84324508320512
i scarcely know replied the count   44.468082681242194
that is difficult replied athos   171.2615521216709
the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom   23.08914981646808
he asked me   27.08841588057561
the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what i have to tell   178.64844867351593
at ten in the evening if that suits you   209.32197511416126
this letter was read publicly in all parts of the city   187.17523476827523
no matter observed caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase it   143.0463564494059
and now replied d artagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us   154.28325220110492
you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them   112.13342819383614
i must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands   101.89841177720247
but as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality   78.1765787789969
cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars   80.12956606718026
what is this light   216.6098723559823
and what may a myth be   104.91434578129846
thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it   176.98167186943795
chapter lv   127.30032170197167
and he heaved a sigh   198.25582853869219
20183m the beautiful greek of yesterday   105.19794483929104
i come to die in the arms of a friend   196.38218940140007
whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building   25.947849425118406
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration   64.7391539384208
alas yes   103.83378837692341
monte cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial   159.6237887043996
the pharaon   131.1002741309578
emmanuel julie farewell   89.3718805433745
never mind renée replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features   116.47703566702889
an instant after dantès entered   113.1349100933576
how so if he loved her   215.96348438561625
in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relation to my own   43.46368696856315
shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all   51.34310138759888
but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy   129.79210114293372
i thought you had softened   64.49443818042285
not been there i would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even after thinking of it   7.6709496538016
it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands   51.79457621842002
they were said however to be of good extraction   114.89284626548685
but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands   3.611578176662732
grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard   147.71219226593212
but for real love for true jealousy is there any reality except illusions and chimeras   106.22451416410988
his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish   106.8295150649792
at the sight of the stranger m   223.6984039415008
the pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of it   157.97906358525304
whose is the ocean upon which we look   174.79994906292407
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos   204.94029550383675
does he talk   90.59614862707208
the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one   6.496811745891023
and i even think he recognizes me   148.678538913842
yes   256.7324126331583
now for my part i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece   98.26838787187421
then turning to the young man he exclaimed a fine prize   82.48479387402881
prorsus admirabile   59.0287651878779
forsooth   190.47824985297405
the king went straight to him   128.95878783737837
but to dantès eye there was no darkness   292.5604196738999
both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent   163.32157994959545
the two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to marshal de grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given   124.15227911141446
and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbé busoni   256.58360865996093
monsieur de tréville awaits monsieur d artagnan cried a servant throwing open the door of the cabinet   61.69377877242246
he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers   98.18572535695296
but wait   177.54359369751273
the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is   128.52586259614685
have you provided yourself with money   33.81972234279388
and you of me sir said louvieres   85.93210059781492
of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant   52.507372552878266
what is such or such a prince to us who fixed the diadem upon a great queen s head   198.4955784038168
but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him   275.1133466299226
the mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable   65.43683358440087
one would have said andrea anticipated his companion s words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for a moment   144.07595350343405
yes monseigneur   217.08530960563047
four men of good will who will risk being killed with me   121.4988063996959
the four friends followed him   256.9857064131086
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist   123.89209310071244
we must trust in god   237.6271914173374
besides d artagnan passed the evening with me   142.40781727196062
cried kitty and i am very wretched   202.67926608540336
he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the jardin des plantes   103.56687023024476
answered porthos   74.66621718943586
you are my uncle   52.512056919137535
the young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death   29.873163137315174
his majesty king louis xiii   164.13804298758456
m   27.76127502098231
grimaud s a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton   210.13812769380536
de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition   35.753873626786714
her face as she looked at athos had taken on an expression that can not be described   73.73991699470528
and so being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and rich and that is happiness sir why do you call me unhappy   98.88429442668517
but of yours it may be said i hope every dream is an illusion   157.1260888943376
murmured villefort clasping his hands   87.08404685102221
said athos are you still afraid   132.4289092487243
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip   92.40988293771207
he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality   147.75520218208555
athos pointed to the bastion   200.3265508636824
continued the count   171.1559902280179
6   39.43753551591814
there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence   100.6441650492456
but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself   123.25627607813938
my friend you take me for some one else   98.25972981136519
i am all attention   155.47878972553997
come with me then   144.0016999185364
come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy   8.625924456986695
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari   115.72152707009958
if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said morrel i would invite the count to our house   115.83194672892228
the more ill will i have toward monsieur bonacieux the more punctual i shall be in keeping the appointment made by that letter which makes you so uneasy   280.7929906364777
but that is doing things in lordly style my friend   117.38167891377384
well said the count what are you doing   104.36786650038952
but why should it   67.41856622536147
unlimited credit chapter 47   44.43864387602643
he denies himself nothing   279.8892201822515
the country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald   71.19199289983995
my dear friends said d artagnan give your swords to monsieur mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners   58.80594437664387
has something fresh happened   160.7629853344222
de morcerf   0.7852997434736295
i threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that i mightn t break my promise and strangle grimaud   174.38620012773913
yes milady replied athos   128.4342096960728
richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position   82.83434100333598
do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands   66.6967015347173
it was now nine o clock   19.675526759109204
tis well said porthos we shall remember that   119.06507926324554
this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh   178.40716958290528
de tréville which informed him that at his request the king had promised that he should enter the company of the musketeers   165.2849486709316
you knew i should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me   256.28303204232674
woman   148.78617963822822
it is count de rochefort   172.40676830786876
replied porthos who   228.89922653717554
as i told you it is an old family jewel   130.34701905948083
let us push on then to noyon   100.84722252769885
i bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle   6.6430568394184775
i wish to speak to your mamma   0.48733039070837947
pardon me for having joined with your persecutors   107.50062374217518
in the smuggling line   218.65537537005736
so far well said aramis   103.58474872541795
but i repeat it again to you replied felton in great emotion no danger threatens you   94.33636328720839
oh m   145.6245569084451
his only fear was that milady would recognize in him the man of meung and of dover   108.27070740812206
he then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen garden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and d artagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia   156.78735221965522
0123m but how can i sell out here   213.89485671109594
d artagnan who as a gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athos s maxim but he did his best to keep up with his host   91.16796836072989
sighed mercédès   188.08516986044805
the artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture   176.9983510503134
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents   56.907654198601755
and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation   91.25900704586195
rest assured cried the duchess i shall do what i can   122.00093625202632
indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem   129.33177071403776
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majesty s example and not get killed for your folly in this den   96.36270039968404
he has at least found peace   97.82610874251564
you have given your word then   15.670661601088327
then said tréville it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace   141.6090354511433
milady had stabbed herself   147.0049632186965
had any one but you been there i don t say d artagnan bowed   166.75791807799996
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him   68.58993958780574
he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man and fainted   169.26468122500154
by paying for it of course as among honest folk   86.04349373943175
he was very pale   184.53555615780658
andrea cavalcanti   105.17771586416988
maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor   181.70236623579467
he were a dead man said the gascon if there were still a vitry at the court and if vitry entered at this moment   179.68860797899194
at three o clock came two companies of the guards one french the other swiss   257.1019455125824
one opposite to me the other with his back to me   133.36781219349547
then sounding his bell he said to ali who entered i am going to madame s chamber have the carriage ready at one o clock   41.77208260200658
if dead to deny him the rites of christian burial   84.13033457053635
she   124.08462157746958
the abbé bowed   222.75207287376037
asked he   90.47369770507675
you ungrateful to marie michon monsieur   90.42929370230918
but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died   177.45334030168138
it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed   258.2668672789332
sit down in mercy   99.58528577936805
the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed   71.50611128137169
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said d artagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation   205.1071791140818
but why mother   53.00629109373088
and that is true   93.87750921318514
i am sorry too monsieur   140.97814256436928
bonacieux to the chamber of examination   33.3079098686805
the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head   77.10618371751278
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served   159.20595574281873
ah just so said albert   105.9574708279089
but don carlos   96.1388595094178
he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation   238.38788048323943
the escape was fixed to take place at seven o clock   95.98331942248348
the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort   121.06592122612582
but said he whom d artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st   161.59768506643755
well at the height of his despair god assisted him through human means   79.61378806879188
i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings   138.42408165647197
but said porthos if he was not crushed completely ah   134.04106433310432
franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host   151.80393629533958
and perhaps his saddle therewith   197.36261689898865
felton snatched away the knife   84.34709124193697
has anything particular happened in the neighborhood   185.46824688395412
the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eyes already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief   134.6306007683214
then my friend take back this ring to which i see you attach much value   49.175831733493084
what are the wishes of his eminence   136.77755596421588
but vampa reassured her with a smile tapping the butt of his good fowling piece which threw its ball so well   66.43194884831735
a general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder dantès whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth   158.55685090866828
d artagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village   103.82586467646422
yes indicated noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his glance   192.52125759685936
a friend a friend   155.2549461045997
have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained   12.946772958854751
and that was why i threw myself between you and him   50.240077131447165
i believe i am courageous and since yesterday i have learned the power of will   28.91109074221923
oh why did i not tell you all   149.48826935655904
i know nothing   76.06017645476896

yes your excellency   164.92508372176417
for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame   189.67387230643288
large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companion s elbow directed his attention by his glances   161.8270147886715
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by god s   80.70642945303624
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit   108.9439000821689
en route monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal   78.83480465464973
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions   15.774432862816042
bravo said d artagnan in a whisper to porthos   79.58367747950591
asked monte cristo carelessly   173.3987715617786
yes   139.77561309584524
and where is this house that i purchase   90.41143322971374
but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind   181.23583690254526
it was politics which brought noirtier and m   127.60629326557009

gracious heaven we are hesitating   142.3556924783974
in the corridor he met mme   143.87001105048174

who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign   71.71249709305238
oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children   133.8706341040891
on the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then   150.12336639424626
well like all paris i shall be there too said the count   86.67712368946206
d artagnan was a man and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings   89.37607246625176
the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world   102.58706456008314
said milady to herself   36.102879204385346

albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him   152.75563273082028
here i am my lord   102.8584968633296

the banker was enthusiastic in his applause   58.190925039429345
ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions   207.1772384403385

whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody else   221.6578815283709
but you know it and will interpret for me   32.25182793382223
the guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the english sprang to their swords   217.39177970322066
answered d artagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity   78.19902059403819

and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime   82.26420209123648

and moreover monte cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the count s house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved   70.84129548330932
athos smiled   104.5836997372055

all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that d artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard   178.6804377080802
cried d artagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he   130.20771801422208
de la trémouille but i warn you that i am well informed and all the fault is with your musketeers   193.83963423371182
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel   182.64742061419065
and the king has seen the cardinal   107.49048509069588
replied la ramee   78.84797912419432
let us say no more about it   167.06702140930872
so it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and la ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster   91.14725599919221
felton and he addressed patrick the duke s confidential lackey at the same moment   146.6719794976014
then you will love me   156.24311856655873
d artagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunt s hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance   128.61723530596566
oh count i shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of death   19.02747641864798
30093m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32 000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5 000 francs each   89.8126965988605
and they both entered m   194.07808062102254
has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice   26.80258795791775
i do not reproach you monsieur said d artagnan   165.62732742023007
he threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory   30.70958779462873
noirtier   37.277513661905004
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve o clock   198.7644731475411
come replied the same lofty tone answer   106.8031444277752
one instant my dear friend replied the abbé   45.18751291623185
an hour before daybreak cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to march   98.4107031175773
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength   168.80033153789265
yes   110.35790000100923
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband   208.97577590425553
at la réserve   125.89102665077746
there is in london i hope some establishment like that of the magdalens or of the repentant daughters   128.5285071423923
in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die   81.91281206084136
and if you can find them bring them to me   36.796835414119855
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foot s pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles   179.21351284790248
of what   150.7386627327376
enlighten me and i will then communicate my information to her   175.1115280377513
to be sure yes   113.65941279058846
but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate   158.3306358445664
very well   89.72648386726969
p   128.208795401556
asked the officer   39.29568789485248
raoul obeyed   175.65982983495365
ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother   128.42059393354998
asked porthos   145.70929389095974
said the duchess pensively   96.93920344134649
ah i always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter   32.589750187699295
danglars   69.79382114481024
milady had told the truth her head was confused for her ill arranged plans clashed one another like chaos   105.10494065610595
then turning around and seeing that morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuel s hand significantly watch over him   102.49552923128729
you have more experience than i have   81.15462400165924
and if you can find another employer enter his service   275.5005763957348
you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject   270.99818562692633
make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black eyes   42.453601894972664
what more could the most devoted lover desire   117.72292972381393
notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated   111.17885180279104
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up   1.3797671350907592
you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love   33.249202825757735
let our readers reassure themselves   65.93057836659463
but as they were preparing to escape together they were both arrested   151.8530864422397
he exclaimed   213.10371829277247
lead me into the queen s oratory said d artagnan announce to her i am here and put this parcel with a well loaded musket under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private stair   148.5412875086607
no but we shall make use of them said d artagnan   18.969127211067303
but fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition   152.40183460841098
valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung them   305.8904532477873
well done   108.58044086879568
at the moment he re entered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was doing   0.5562723740924582
i wrote to franz and were he here he would confirm every word i wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being   154.36857377570772
and your friend for instance   57.188253087321684
morcerf did not reply   212.81744629006846
but said mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen   116.63901819866143
say the devil   160.10082836583155
he gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in france   90.77918941207929
see   129.60582410696384
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor   80.1044333053247
this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe   130.14885486217474
and without caring whether he were followed or not he set off   227.00736520753313
m   69.86054957971555
you thought it a mercy then miserable wretch   59.35168882264041
at least i advised him to do so   218.8983618889356
de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees   147.5136093635085
it was the sword of the comte de wardes which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the breast   46.050054065680854
but i come expressly for that purpose   72.80784333266087
oh   54.39544090662578
we did not see his companion come out   15.688134227216679
the king s friend you understand   1.2256998873529454
one day the old man fell ill and died   88.1372987393021
de villefort for three months he took not a step out of doors without my following him   122.46909776374058
father and son m   68.96170809973185
to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me   201.3164010718261
you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world can not equal in horror   130.31397327500986
oh the red duke   187.3567405586286
the sacrifice is too great and i feel what it must cost you   154.57983553147216
for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them   22.570651512701744
asked one of the attendants   208.46641847613523
he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante   179.6676034381062
well your eternal city is a nice sort of place   205.9324591199881
and besides an idea had struck me   223.3899088743956
confound it   123.35831080743093
well   53.4798866617938
danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it   101.54823051988792
every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render but can not   153.40980840546115
i had three similar ones returned monte cristo   60.40023807330053
but in coming too early i should be afraid of awakening your majesty   172.31804461938452
asked dantès eagerly   133.32934004978375
athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone   135.0137562032362
he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea   109.97100446295707
if i live i am only a man who has broken his word failed in his engagements in fact only a bankrupt   156.2717173466281
that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin   128.83107249918365
you were   76.39572169493164
inquired the countess eagerly   48.79848586493567
call mr   139.2354086210146
i will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a frondist my young friend and a hearty frondist too   59.937069157407784
what do you fear   183.98317674607233
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said   106.80808355297683
i will ask the cardinal   136.64282069158028
we have said that at half past twelve o clock madame danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage   168.93359354957596
valentine chapter 94   145.0359606912464
the boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous mass   14.453383498449469
yes   68.07707495871152
athos invited d artagnan to follow them   59.40402486477794
besides his probity was irreproachable in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with their religion and their consciences lovers with the rigorous delicacy of our era and the poor with god s seventh commandment   138.29574418782025
in vain were i an ambitious man should i struggle against such remembrances as he has left   191.61494790377844
yes said he   58.80007777753506
abundance of hair falling over her shoulders   35.99406217245435
you have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulate let it continue to do so   40.31063094410543
and before dantès could open his mouth before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoner s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon   129.4251397205295
what   177.62138916429325
what do you mean   142.85520506163556
to every argument they replied we must go for death is in this house   204.55937473434537
he credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself   143.06608039206455
take it and there ends the matter   126.3228670091111
my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which i shall be able to procure will remain my own   142.8814377117853
the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes   90.47201937592726
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please   22.221323107672532
his consent would be your justification in god s sight   153.29906201375456
this affair does not then weigh upon your conscience   186.7652835541602
seek not to console me   148.97899153362505
you don t know all yet   124.10239489585501
at the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the almo surrounded the carriage   169.4523943115364
what s the knot for   33.00979969814803
we are lost said d artagnan in the ear of athos   123.12459393229123
they were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent smiles   102.75473016907954
they knew all they wished to know   99.10247213121154
but it cost me dear   138.39299347400856
the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson   34.22607236589032
enter gentlemen said laporte since the queen desires you so to do   51.1825291207232
and i set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this   183.27611505322267
that is a child s reason monsieur blaisois said mousqueton in his most patronizing manner   110.94499358997389
why   70.15254446164836
but this time the papers were a mere matter of form   197.60186058279044
true said d artagnan   146.19033936833594
by the joices the prinns the cromwells   116.46543499753037
yes   78.25351762569261
a letter from the king perhaps   152.35613606415967
he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms   8.81892809746644
yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon   130.19614531851653
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome   140.9991252061307
a secondary cause but not the principal   202.56701198833537
not a thought was given to a life which you once mercédès had the power to render blissful   17.182952748667148
there are three others do you know anything of their situation   119.98825183797304
you think then said he that i am taken to the château d if to be imprisoned there   175.16004222316226
well you can do better   128.40004310105635
who can tell   196.5120548605844
i know him also but unfortunately he is not in paris   142.9984378484526
cried a voice in french answering to that of winter which made them tremble   119.04130784410968
some parting words to his friends   127.88775146343963
they had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed place   102.43037863496636
certainly if milady s strength had been equal to her hatred mme   59.040615743338854
here is madame returning with monsieur   144.11400293188288
is he danglars   173.4709080025283
it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her seat   132.00889769142225
my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count s assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger   26.38506148345222
ah cursed gascon that i am i get from one hobble into another   82.51825448774719
this time the musketeers did more than shudder they almost cried out   109.20350758373013
said milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind   127.08891582844869
zounds   123.18270288732003
because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it   151.08076260852394
and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in   39.17684451553768
oho   34.3177873039657
are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage   150.45228782586332
but this favor which you bestow upon me i do not merit   96.02815273038343
eleven o clock had struck   201.89802782498464
asked the visitor   10.774058141592505
true said porthos   177.75370109756904
do you know what you did unfortunate adviser   160.34617344406473
and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied d artagnan in a low voice i beg you to follow me   238.8409342215051
shall i see you again   33.39275296210637
then said d artagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer   119.10354534944777
dantès your health   163.45284596992593
ah try it   144.16151234224174
you have indeed a noble nature edmond and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment   196.93245478265646
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them   155.19542922901948
had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale   150.39450843537196
but you have never told me that you did not love me   60.78242599245115
that is not prudent said caderousse   103.97229499608709
org donate   103.49665014117826
then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation see raoul   98.5721973491774
to some elevated spot whence i can look down on lens and the surrounding country in that case i m your man   119.85629597066811
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count   62.06310861303984
what tenderness my sister   106.45007765210359
i increased in wickedness till i committed crime   186.68316417760795
ah this visit was expected   144.73666032614605
franz   3.3741318981351895
i believe mother it is merely a title   81.88364097807623
a small white cloud which had attracted dantès attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the château d if   118.28373024161755
now this point was settled   128.5116570636757
if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape   117.59263024600902
yes replied albert raising his voice   107.28862335048164
40054m indeed said albert it is exquisite   103.89610044110674
but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me   128.39455013563213
said aramis   66.1341786933221
for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother s faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus   176.85781552373663
yes   137.4777274179554
and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time listen well to what i am going to say m   130.20347738155428
instantly monseigneur   8.161802220701617
he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all albert s establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count s chasseur also   123.69272407340493
said d artagnan to the youth   70.49565601463726
be satisfied we shall have this lion   69.966747585443
by a man of from forty to forty five years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left temple   141.41115057054037
well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean   74.80510945021734
now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a woman s weakness there are twelve days   96.0418703179759
said athos very anxiously   116.16302301065383
no sire replied tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire i ll be their warranty   123.57930917916872
but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties   94.00285183699
i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended   215.43372852582337
monsieur de tréville was but a younger son of a simple gascon family like me madame   91.3892474128014
a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings   185.65915528704005
had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold   150.3062068020742
was this englishman protecting you   203.71084270748526
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness   92.51690680968804
every revolution has its catastrophes returned m   243.56512239999137
she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass plot where she fainted   118.49405618965271
but his heart will be in the army commanded by the duc de beaufort   145.3636966437665
yes   208.85195583853476
your eminence may be certain of that   183.5445405673181
wait your reverence there is a letter   143.82494293202248

i shall find him there   111.57870309916777
and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom he also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another   73.06352717561589
30263m you   33.27793975669408
for the emperor s return   247.61492803785063
yes   183.5704095566234
cried d artagnan more moved than he had been for a long time don t despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one   127.25438469998751
this woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to her   98.70859111722962
grimaud leaped down   31.95735609223796
but i have neither my women nor my servants   78.676635773346
asked d artagnan   149.20815491139768
tis god who gives them into our hands answered groslow   45.49415725878201
oh a mere nothing said monte cristo   125.33326433220473
it was that of a number of men steadily approaching   63.418142854726405
without the saddle   84.30422618529013
i did not think two sapphires of such a fine water existed   212.4910971926558
replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself   133.55570484143095
at any hour you will   159.4336870485677
i took it and advanced towards the thicket   127.84969218676719
and yet without the man the king would have been rescued   202.34777880498456
yes sir   189.25637007432624
you see monsieur what the new world has to do with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe   122.82517946843443
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses worth 32 000 francs to madame danglars   122.77404050825949
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on   187.2414415731798
yes you   168.01527691673454
the host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the table   164.6259570041168
d artagnan he said you are here to night still infuriated by yesterday s adventure   205.92151119947198
on your knees count   140.93686388242213
asked d artagnan   32.13220137556888
aramis continued my dear cousin his eminence the cardinal whom god preserve for the happiness of france and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom is on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of la rochelle   107.51164336232245
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated   120.00754566664463
ah   97.32508509441755
it was this idea that had brought dantès back to the circular rock   15.362911217304628
the four friends exchanged glances   6.908198030133221
there is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of god to inflict death upon himself   148.2032588964331
grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton   184.08417545053757
every one withdrew   95.75464727462213
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it   59.145823780908344
immediately a brilliant light from the next room or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep   182.51657526744378
but he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the mall   96.12460012435838
that will be sufficient where two men having met one of them will remain on the ground   219.85815797930331
then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city   100.11758725337381
but beyond this he was ignorant   81.61446354090617
in the first blazed piles of golden coin   121.96529037132187
if after death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered then noble heart sublime soul then i conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me by the filial obedience i vowed to thee grant me some sign some revelation   138.1812018112654
had morrel been a more quick sighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the king s procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department   95.9880936461675
de tréville s entrance he turned round   182.04279218690755
you expected my son would be a coward   67.63895602593294
there came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him   154.4395605182611
even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to pass   252.99761621922642
a death without agony a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing valentine s name and pressing your hand   76.64037055635566
yes in some respects tolerably well   86.54512918621143
don t be a coward or i shall cut off your ears   134.04495741117745
we are at your eminence s orders   195.22764381101626
at that moment the countenance of mme   194.15834408840175
a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon   244.14022698651502
well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence   138.3826364191417
simply this said the coadjutor   115.68159331593523
so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica   253.67143691997947
the drop of water chapter lxiv   135.30307501550732
he touched him on the shoulder   101.96610027478481
the former executioner of bethune   212.24815146475663
and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume   115.05734393962058
well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related   154.7299930742638
said d artagnan   65.30054831730824
order   50.23019499245157
but what do you require of me then   62.973754562311925
richelieu in fact said aramis it is an absolution according to rule   149.9709390234599
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do   152.2488451549976
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired   4.296636022616539
the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women   169.30139622406344
then striking his forehead he exclaimed oh   167.20285278159045
50095m i rave   65.32773446024908
suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought   158.09969954355557
besides this he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men each capable of killing three d artagnans with two musketeers in short with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men   120.75363417583279
on the contrary i have a most important engagement   16.127090776392848
for as to the letter addressed to m   169.84051277482052
de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmond s favor   141.9784030547904
about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight   140.6646967642057
i should want a porter   122.5827936301984
mithridates rex ponticus said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast   38.73352861619644
these words rang in dantès ears even beneath the waves   179.39079999429194
you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either   172.66979752157596
you are right that is the principle on which i wish to act   53.52889018650987
ah   149.4395496908374
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then reappear   173.85312255611717
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg 1   136.5080844113887
d artagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of himself   75.7992291698703
yes and pretty tight too i can tell you was the answer   153.3381519930599
did i say monsieur de beaufort   127.26660718276703
eleven o clock sounded   38.39173923954411
joannes   94.27268110074442
here take this continued he after rapidly writing the few lines i brought to your excellency and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service and proudly i ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so   205.95912686523496
section 3   116.4700548127001
go to sleep soon louis said the queen for you must be awakened very early   99.50641401358988
but no doubt i was mistaken   37.083669848636745
you allow me to give you this title   123.39117549573486
a pistole is not enough said d artagnan tis worth a louis   154.94552695173442
i want a letter that will enable me to reach the king s presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience   118.33133358938045
what was his name   148.48811818824973
while you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess   42.73185455082512
cavalcanti   133.3133103376746
i understand answered porthos i understand you perfectly on my honor   185.06643124001715
cried d artagnan to him   2.3982763052590883
asked caderousse   127.96046086679154
then drawing near to ali he whispered remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you   120.61500330010533
no replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner   189.93184726245778
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort   208.0191714887026
oh i know this country marvelously   119.49423634929303
nevertheless d artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage   83.59318493751677
you put back the boards sweep the floor go out at the door and run as i told you   98.65409839861344
speak sir speak boldly replied louis   49.651002875251734
sir he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and well studied course   59.03932084361083
the daily renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer a service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy   150.3147635921488
are you certain of it sir   180.46892693185617
i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden   52.11352928305335
but he had gone farther than athos for at the village of festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further   128.14027078280947
sire continued m   127.24997096084591
i tell you sir that two persons exist in you   108.37013222794815
the watchword is king and ré   43.4182049550832
how did the honor or disgrace of m   173.85061297329824
the day after my return to lille my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape   124.27782667579487
this something was enveloped in a cloak and d artagnan at first believed it was a man   44.922083724322206
laporte detained in england as everyone else had been by the orders of charles i   97.53401928705486
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur d herblay and myself to do in your service   90.62176139005621
la carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocket book and a bag   112.08156504449174
asked he   74.95228830845241
the poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past   188.09628634074778
very well show him to me   29.84472938589184
all the ties which attach him to life break in the hand of man particularly the golden ties   118.5279737093782
without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it   173.37478441930313
cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d armilly her singing teacher   96.13561416271362
you are right a mute from the east   143.20090076401993
no my daughter is not guilty   67.85012997743266
a serious matter said the count looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him   114.64404505943965
anne frowned slightly when mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand   248.44288812276884
the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard   182.73586491913295
not like monsieur de richelieu who went on just as he pleased   158.97845768450824
put him to death   115.13991358951587
come dear d artagnan look up a little   57.65469025375251
explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor   75.02100326021879
the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves   183.67535438874145
and your excellency now owes me 4 999 louis   129.8008894305833
athos pale but resolute   7.503072103083582
the king pointed this out   53.46041526431307
eight   198.49582588968423
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers   207.14057170719383
but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire   218.31267756821978
felton entered milady s apartment   93.68889712185728
beauchamp said monte cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening   199.5956109516506
athos gave raoul some of the holy water   190.94629362085078
the ordinary events took place   165.90677813745327
the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless   165.83685257585444
i ll have you turned out   87.0903492025999
my lord bishop he cried seizing juxon s hands where is providence   75.16505731715523
at the door they found the old servant   212.70679101255305
but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon porthos he contented himself with saying monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign will he not madame coquenard   76.73126594818841
but what does not change or changes for the better is wine   183.56542606858156
the next morning when d artagnan entered aramis s chamber he found him at the window   79.22484502999086
i not only confess it but am proud of it returned the gascon   109.8369969749941
although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the studs   119.52149354606205
because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty sword thrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand   120.5759827653216
porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization and he had brought him away without any other recommendation   108.99134807725343
nothing   114.98370596886198
the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend   66.86059952389887
i sprang toward the table i seized a knife i placed it to my breast   33.67195287924834
heaven preserve him   63.18621830199899
a bruise   84.63807508432996
maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability   91.18432839894425
i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence   110.18010835798724
then no longer able to resist he called out   181.7661172994927
even to swear by mahomet   77.4417825177052
she could not get out and had heard all   37.897046170078156
arrest the prime minister of king charles i   68.03650317851421
no   75.47862288485834
the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy   183.84033281266943
madame resumed athos two of my friends named d artagnan and monsieur du vallon sent to england by the cardinal suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of france   59.683714879807205
my dear fellow replied albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleon s maxim never awaken me but for bad news   142.25046515814043
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man   33.34137560530479
but presently the exempt s face suddenly brightened   143.0593053489008
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed d artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock   132.20394151540705
was this woman english   212.5038525576432
20253m they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world returned the count quietly   44.71750372305786
the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy   107.36197204029052
de villefort attracted by the noise appeared on the threshold   123.77537408041678
mazarin came within three steps of d artagnan and pushed a spring in the wall   140.8416860971436
you said just now that the sea was treacherous and he has been gone four months and during these four months there have been some terrible storms   157.59049465753424
help   156.70033365268316
he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept   198.48302239178153
then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you   74.2212157557887
chapter xlii   87.76565351931183
tell him to come in said mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed   213.85734263943
are you on the ground   152.35539353322056
under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary   39.73217104199087
d avrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then m   176.47566804433595
you gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table   229.24471983503082
because mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers   74.75707984979277
beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals   39.91805017243483
they had understood each other without speaking   223.3025228610848
then turning towards monte cristo count said he in the name of all that is dear to you i entreat you not to kill albert   66.84566728974022
he said   0.34564605285557093
they resumed their route   147.09538156641298
perhaps so   65.5080358401643
ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly   89.13231844978927
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt   38.82559124705378
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment   181.5666652577995
when are you to be married   116.43437029026887
oh my god   77.43731218434625
now you are a man and are able to give me advice   219.74522437514884
no she must have conceived some pathetic scene   76.50163197696928
every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest   100.01532515397666
no   180.01669746804708
father replied the child i swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king   140.97200305872963
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere   192.79552984354433
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir   70.31833960482894
and athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers   53.67638649383683
you eat at everybody s mess   91.1642262567621
speak said the queen   80.37547056361927
we will keep on the frontiers for instance   150.93621944864793
his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the window   74.6971245255852
still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of   102.25577046517525
ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise   91.59943685995665
you know i am cool enough   113.66138552844224
why should i   92.21014799843249
yes   137.409934949149
ask the vicomte de morcerf   111.31103109581761
yes replied the old man   123.98729031691822
evening came   156.16467284287793
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac   121.24511332402635
went without recompense   63.48675585449011
go directly   145.18078792287162
will you permit me then to recall another to you   161.87984816464038
but replied felton i wish to know   50.754739577192765
passing alongside one of them d artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meung the same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom d artagnan had thought so handsome   138.62729140033403
the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering   131.0209526964055
my mother was a christian and she prayed   95.04007209817215
and he appeared to meditate   54.67005955885867
he cried   134.47987228071756
asked he   103.7245768790916
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks   86.71524162990714
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise   86.29820016449978
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding   89.23446821983633
why should i   101.19718233929743
most likely replied vampa coolly   64.07939118296439
what   103.29079920703072
be easy i am a gentleman   133.3606617867103
e   144.81945292061317
alas   148.07195223734197
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable   49.93860820341635
indeed   184.94365065930268
do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own   108.24953279030679
yes   154.74916889125382
notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers d artagnan felt completely solitary   58.84146318273605
proud of this exploit vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders and carried him to the farm   221.02902110620926
ah noble fellow   87.55020107980533
now said d artagnan i am going to call this soldier and talk to him   74.74428145496621
you have promised him that i shall live   175.0408322058363
i have begun a poem in verses of one syllable   184.87679994978447
antoine   178.8723625951003
now bring the alicante and some biscuits   180.68823606767157
that was what he could not know   137.33224413560504
are you a politician friend   238.67001129637993
i can not consent that this woman should die thus   150.96762180403462
come said danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me i should like to help you but yes said caderousse but how   86.12803750281941
but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought   169.43134853524535
said the count to the veiled woman   175.1796908223167
no be not anxious   131.64581645489474
for stealing   219.30432014640408
de morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal   142.39798960786203
aramis smiled   25.1913741696752
i think i hear a noise she said   4.626363663972384
on reaching the capital athos and aramis found it in arms   129.4226539733144
you are stupid replied the cardinal   129.92602314746054
you didn t forget my purse   160.5836160092678
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed   172.07050713967593
30175m yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning   100.03084039116727
now go   118.37082096811861
and i the duc de beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers   8.919618756587568
close the door said la carconte   65.45309863090449
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger   146.23357287260924
there is still hope   106.09851786051115
you can not but perceive that all this must end some way or other   193.080410857983
i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker   209.0924183991356
mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristo s eyes   124.76327480269845
for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns which however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at a later period   239.00528009964995
the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover   87.7692869027236
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance   258.5132716419085
about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars   170.89918324459325
madame danglars rose from her seat pale and cold   108.50588038053
with another man milady might have preserved some doubt   124.52669978199275
you stop at the spot where he received the blow   215.97065092129077
no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance   51.59453164326986
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg 1   112.26559758598859
when i shall lay my head on the block and say remember   96.14388051709102
and d artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking   121.85853260161815
cried bazin a poem sell so dear as that   175.1003509868631
7 in the rue meslay   106.45915261051391
as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning   99.02323964165026
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance   121.43464636868953
two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand   131.1073462581252
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling   63.86748427015013
we four will go   98.60892044951346
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water   117.81272308871254
ah said the englishman is it you my master   186.30813320638143
he could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him   133.70548714618872
he hopes so maximilian   167.52416943031997
what blows what blood   203.86342872769515
thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen   57.252655956361465
i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs   89.48693431414165
it was a vendetta followed by restitution   57.245255227709
they are veritable sponges   126.3486737691414
three times athos knocked without receiving an answer   89.1134939364176
anne s head was bent down she had not seen the italian s smile   94.15785739878396
pass the pen to aramis who writes theses in latin   44.37443013340372
a very respectable lady said aramis   179.66866495166346
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart   188.44875339900534
so my dear aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny   117.92057003148707
on the contrary stay monsieur d artagnan   33.906359353831704
a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was   13.746831670657286
perfectly madame   163.65397772187094
help help my friends   125.5045399407213
true said the abbé with a stifled sigh mercédès it was   103.79826574742845
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles   116.90815417546752
then he placed a sentinel at each door with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his valet de chambre patrick   166.3060133911792
cried the young man   185.05353031600384
when you wish to obtain some concession from a man s self love you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it   128.2494212818591
god knows planchet that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere whom we loved so much   150.18181334694546
he is at vincennes   169.84733994412343
de saint méran s house   134.98047421920003
and do you suppose this will be forgotten   135.2834897456978
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty   95.67698637232075
the young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other sequel   54.53892119073942
the boat was now moving with the wind   41.635935573431226
i ask you what year is it   84.8474218531289
allow me porthos said aramis   76.2744803605157
oh what a dreadful event   219.43398597020587
well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch   42.54977355296647
well replied athos i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur porthos   131.32000271554438
precisely so   87.89261026873699
let me save the last   149.10056486399182
you must show me the proofs against him   172.81664886357473
in july we added 1 700 000 francs it was you know the month of the spanish bonds   279.05180697414335
i hope these gentlemen have theirs   167.48315579096908
had stolen away this child in order that your name might become extinct   115.72998001807656
but on his way he met athos who during his relief which d artagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that d artagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight   64.65349470745781
aramis again presented himself at the bishop s   166.730556057534
the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get along save yourselves   187.4909589133719
oh no   205.13862217836777
and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures   293.4192732421086
he kept his word   137.86726353919994
which   147.20810825665717
that which we can not obtain   131.54435165894608
now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend albert not to come any more this evening   211.18405308435098
for my part dear mother interposed renée i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into m   101.33763637119876
have you any one to depend on for assistance   146.52751031987276
listen   48.861242324478994
perhaps you mean to disobey me   154.30320207363516
it was to that obedience i owe her portrait   154.1500479114584
go and call upon him in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine   202.58756884014747
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter   25.213797926749123
well then we ll do our best   59.33055015402317
these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain   147.87325028225615
a noise was heard in the hall   72.63370369449156
these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon   14.532125015909685
it looks as if you were trying to fleece me   228.0241102960337
art thou dangerously wounded my dear mousqueton   97.74791761493526
it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteur s carriage said d artagnan   111.516365246697
well   176.4824062623727
what do you want   33.22834054496619
they are mistaken   216.71691262385696
have you really no desire to meet him   79.85494969912654
cried the cardinal astonished   9.640671522582537
the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the abbé faria had spread the riches of his mind   197.50058141409218
as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a hunting hound in his old master s company   110.21450214656358
oh   142.58157951170404
the three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around d artagnan and his companions   175.85782833244187
if you know why don t you tell   52.14075319960975
yes just before you came   30.46075713231626
go edward and see   66.13455560141975
madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself   79.49035458207084
why yes replied the count   82.75926208277623
ah sir exclaimed madame de villefort clasping her hands what do you say   41.38799238723895
and if they will consent to go with you to england i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave whitehall   65.9593653167378
and yours monsieur d herblay   185.4476538588573
but what is the meaning of all these questions   223.33190111933806
go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints   80.48091917572484
god will punish you   106.58437946892056
total   89.64683083396308
then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea   57.82172011682207
the scotchman   45.688911855812705
d artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine india linen to implore her pardon   104.49168211874566
you believe and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies of the enemy of england of the enemy of god   103.02377837708016
we have not thought about it yet madame answered d artagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete   130.8455405706293
the punishment of death replied d artagnan   152.94608358564764
the antechamber of m   0.0009616153216711609
i hope so with all my heart said the gascon and i confess my weakness   72.18977484761595
you were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim   74.79947761351318
i must leave you said du tremblay   114.76537835856567
when he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses   148.92644040644257
noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the chair   168.02596322826417
neither of them spoke to him   65.05154820464882
that s well said monte cristo   191.12639648953544
it must be nearly four o clock   57.120674308466455
but what are they to do   15.649881294399933
alas   24.019705772296774
but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments quærens quem devoret   154.82469638852706
and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising   128.7550727111215
in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another   129.82561389416716
what can he be looking for   71.77977322771157
i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army   83.4524185147136
say not so   171.53845869239694
they lost her   152.63552501412073
do you think i can not be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only arabs who cut off heads   84.7433684052168
what i am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree   249.030766450456
the king was closeted with the cardinal and m   126.26790172984809
besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about   59.502588330304505
no no make your mind satisfied on that point   119.31733686509253
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner   127.09227344368338
the two friends were in the via dei pontefici   162.70258981564655
the king and his escort were no longer there   118.03197365885933
shall i send word to him as coming from you   146.16521145976722
one of our clients is a horsedealer   74.68000440465974
and with his lackey he took the road to the governor s country house   129.85212751205705
and fernand said caderousse with a chuckle   106.1774405974216
fernand went and mercédès remained alone   128.8693525415489
that is well said mme   71.77439697625024
would anything retain you particularly in paris   77.98941263844057
true this story has diverted our attention from them   203.49021020774256
to whom then   113.03889892169016
but it behooved us to find it   152.8575195347015
give me a simple assignment of your debt   133.26009419149665
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science   50.514643431984524
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution   44.198383712798545
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow   109.73264524313099
you seem to forget the orders i received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince   83.29104307675401
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the world   139.88797416154944
valentine we may easily conceive where morrel s appointment was   34.799836145611536
nevertheless aramis was in a good situation and able to defend himself   2.715165056351637
asked the sweet silvery voice of mercédès   149.49629725072373
de salvieux s letter embraced renée kissed the marquise s hand and shaken that of the marquis started for paris along the aix road   176.90016237119565
well   81.21188614739933
perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies   124.37696638839806
monte cristo drew back in horror   212.5744370133661
while singing milady listened   46.929630110986054
i am acquainted with it   128.25034650294367
you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard   98.6863905848568
these devote their blood those their nightly labors to the same cause   71.28111449632894
i had seen him conversing that morning with grimaud and grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service   246.5621139609819
i am monsieur du poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of vincennes   82.06531236346395
a nightly patrol   201.15502187544575
aramis drew the letter from his pocket   101.79568678084661
de tréville for they were the first to whom he communicated it   162.7398711917841
the affair at armentieres   258.55586751925114
positively these four men must be on my side   155.14710953808805
be assured i will return the favor hereafter   178.6840960223753
your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence   1.8581936482846544
interrupted d artagnan   107.27692738385332
not yet replied porthos   130.93622705001488
he gives you his word of honor said gondy   194.48258674543337
how could i pronounce that word   33.557205483710604
no   137.26162716199423
you think so   179.44497362703683
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food   121.49013346570084
they are coming full gallop   118.65529169330134
oh bid him enter   158.57809241207562
chapter lxi   163.02378741457335
the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the château d if seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy   163.04477739018512
ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know   83.77419502668863
chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword   163.3687339236917
grimaud answered in four   78.01268394078878
to its address my lord   173.4172893243286
do you know that i die to morrow at ten o clock   37.20371786695753
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him   30.807340583394407
dantès closely and eagerly examined it   177.33574752718093
the first movement of d artagnan was to return it but milady added no no   192.70978793641777
the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm   100.5922760779947
indeed m   121.50549944578457
she then thought that lord de winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her jailer   159.4384581574095
poor queen   124.05943029813662
d artagnan and the englishman d artagnan followed milady without being perceived by her   52.23550940001904
monsieur and madame de saint méran died as soon   91.82530186291268
they both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak   140.73992317693893
with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of buckingham   101.52792234209332
that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them   135.09292624367816
cried d artagnan   99.35341410808525
in order to make one s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves it was necessary to be an officer a great noble or a pretty woman   108.080448982325
said porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan   162.72280117260243
the young men looked at each other   137.96589895467616
porthos   87.98868272497617
be it then as you desire   148.9756643870949
five minutes after the door keeper again appeared   170.54499329340257
let us rather kill them   88.35251308341373
as for the decanter master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks   101.58405806234106
if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened   52.52031322326101
they continued to admire it but said no more about it   190.108439228138
said caderousse in a choking voice i was there   23.239044191339545
the door yielded   191.0196299534532
because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp   131.6997281063096
yes morrel said monte cristo with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young man s excitement   189.81711021356503
then i launched out into the path that was opened to me   71.61299793108427
and yet said porthos   139.50751306297832
as for me my heart is overflowing with happiness   193.83063823661908
morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes   93.07617736917514
but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out to night for paris   74.31362585545398
i am not mad replied faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners   176.181824192097
oh lucien can i confide in you   75.97498077243227
i have always said to you i love you as a brother   204.77728597526658
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm   131.06104893297442
a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance   74.21702006062563
no repeated noirtier   147.8980063357496
monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what i promised you   26.422122041937342
give me your horse porthos   218.65645728179445
from the queen   75.40002011373076
asked the count   48.44241673454553
albert besides being an elegant well looking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability   122.55966892111633
it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he   235.7295088659552
but have you no request to make for yourself mercédès   142.714488007764
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all   78.7470940546132
but without doubt m   170.66936676829602
are we going to continue this pace all night   192.69526994376014
it seemed to all three that they knew him   85.93795744326948
sacré bleu   65.08568174847534
ah it is really a serious matter then   201.71586908015234
then it was so murmured winter and the next day henry iv   229.71580899770237
difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms   76.94528308214984
you know of my engagement to louise   152.60960200858065
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you   93.10256533975269
no   164.8887869817216
madame said athos when must we set out   129.4031695126798
why did you not have him arrested while in paris   109.65207255352314
yes but in regard to myself my lord it can not be so for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence   179.88052991673868
all his funds amounted to 6 000 or 8 000 francs his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4 000 or 5 000 which making the best of everything gave him 14 000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287 500 francs   215.93302016704206
so a pretty little lass my faith is that soubrette   13.44445994309558
said d artagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing   86.88198444012177
caderousse   150.4452279758949
yes   101.41578372952794
in the name of the prefect of police i ask you what you know of him   126.95340326014384
my jeweler and my secretary   112.48552475985136
oh   119.21310172888401
are you all here   87.2713821749353
again the abbé smiled   116.6857243407941
ah my faith yes   124.25544393314468
d artagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence   76.88879420425334
what must be done   238.5594762455621
my heart told me what your mouth has just confirmed that is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this moment and i sent my cutter to meet you   11.005187882761263
nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said d artagnan   86.76627348736207
but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets   137.3154209944216
we will see where it leads to   20.715072631344682
the other room near the library was a bedroom   51.81966120290842
yes but you have at least this consolation that you can say to yourself she has not quit you voluntarily that if you learn no news of her it is because all communication with you is interdicted   149.79441820858884
and yet said d artagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make sorties   130.708926763835
a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman   222.56032329015574
responded franz   137.64469255413684
she is in prison   181.50886724783345
your note of this morning has completely bewildered me   152.60105867365334
he gallantly offered the right hand seat to beppo and sat by him   126.93881873100491
whom shall i announce   112.31703929212146
said the captain   107.19006679577468
how can i   143.2641660294428
go he said go my child   115.19154429555654
i hear a horse s steps   181.25522840654855
one of your guards my prince   143.08499795429546
tis well we will see if the king s name is not a passport everywhere replied the gascon   12.279997568621212
thought d artagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me   125.94697127046697
my faith monsieur   59.66947187439271
there is another way said morrel   40.128226207678026
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief   99.62627816353103
my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement   175.29009263365742
yes i am going   108.1041974776825
selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey   208.73478498303245
asked peppino of his friend   141.67296868732893
yes   61.675572735598884
but when aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light that is to say with all its advantages   165.5394569858302
the prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts   160.00739754596253
and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary glass   27.225573950842602
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure   26.338751700050025
said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death   99.98530302112084
and still further upon my honor i don t like english horses   191.6565455472974
as he thus reasoned monte cristo walked down the rue de la caisserie   210.75757785043675
bonacieux at home chapter xviii   105.48499709614572
silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husband s arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow   29.684290218648727
nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection   58.54647817620766
you shall see   40.78017496373283
but rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years   88.20729738635823
believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever   84.56411809956194
three hundred pistoles   52.14269422210579
as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure   147.0077520734988
then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the child s lips   130.3522388789599
0351m oh sir said caderousse putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow oh sir do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man   120.04638838734297
the old man s declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort   113.39340748440755
the count again struck the gong   174.83332396384398
constance bonacieux   87.41918338369801
the procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color   24.27828525217666
and whether it was the result of chance or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both while he had donned their costume they had assumed his   122.20867055381044
well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says like master like servant   162.78159640030157
m   121.32393868457153
by the side of the luxembourg   219.59769599796002
he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first relay   144.1822731629257
by jove   104.69222472044044
this illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjects fallen from her high estate   110.6306265264403
well there s just the man we want said athos   134.42377438371247
bonacieux   160.3457389455928
we will wait then said morrel   52.64709562260771
indiscretion oh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject   119.08389731105127
and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you   79.9958699755255
sir said the cardinal you have heard me   88.8892848585982
and in whose behalf are you looking for them   129.10672687010737
what is it   151.48265789317077
and attention   183.7203504605682
aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood   88.24404098136182
he saluted and made a movement to depart   108.9465973302773
why do you ask me now   129.09662109475315
but no matter   94.96727758348469
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy   37.50013818636029
returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him   82.45068925005468
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him   63.050797335045395
is monsieur your cousin   52.62648410233375
the count was thoughtful and silent   154.1472580613367
it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which i did not dare to question you since you told me nothing   114.3978463963074
monte cristo on the contrary took the right hand   103.35908723314012
it was not long before they joined the escort   83.67585632848939
were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning   236.70921314595415
ah see there now   33.024674043759234
he said   55.147985981309546
in the capture of a king his degradation and his murder   177.3268869753557
you are examining the luxury i enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her   202.37654256764085
he was struck by a sudden idea   160.3097247803326
can they have received any news my lord   38.2536646696263
now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes   68.23549785376264
what is this   82.38872802784005
did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo   171.28548067472633
go away he said   243.5930918888939
well then to the king your nephew   190.72425863129706
still further athos obtained of m   135.22022281888977
no dying   109.98780418499737
it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty   29.654941338638594
d artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still agitated   158.17992817154067
that is well understood   206.5864803007413
yes   99.6958582975674
my dear fellow said debray you have come in the nick of time   158.5526034912417
noirtier s room   74.12145617806237
zaccone are the same absolutely the same   176.3769202836816
oh oh   175.2486803337705
i love you as my life for you are the best the noblest of created beings   192.7715537056774
as to franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days   35.06868205746346
why one of them is a rich lord from touraine and the other a knight of malta of noble family   48.03244251714638
franz   90.45344298561473
athos then called olivain   86.65433827536569
cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense   10.640596804402975
he gazed doubtfully wistfully on danglars and then caution supplanted generosity   119.23490035414113
will all paris be there   32.66269182369528
he said take this take it and send for something immediately   136.40475315359913
you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs   141.67032020182447
i have concentrated here at naseby camp all the resources heaven has left me and i write to you in haste from thence   105.73922975314537
mercédès is not accountable to any person is she   164.4735551014338
but that relatively to all i have learned you have yet a great deal to learn   21.988381394351876
you are about to become captain at nineteen an elevated post   109.87071810951454
but it was too late   112.16108491785468
we have not a minute to lose   70.58226571081315
d artagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs   149.60286753999173
milady shuddered through her whole system   19.936716556974517
particularly as i have business in that quarter   75.74502049342942
replied d artagnan who knew nothing about it but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on   15.121464789905204
sir replied haydée i have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief   47.90523931689202

for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them   99.12518248814794

she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution   196.8270927258293

both were men of courage and honor   170.11211997434927
it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him   144.0130509797481
now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time   78.37340934388689
what do you think of that interrogator   173.78568968391207

the title attracted me   166.5747845532636
it is true between ourselves that m   115.50459171659077
his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution   276.8086010375707
and do you think she is not there   162.51415452781356
no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in england   160.25795443231425

the old man winked violently   48.00963621052915
what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede   46.648560222380155
extremely replied he   134.5775587084931
the horses only arrived at two o clock and the cicerone did not bring the passport till three   145.54611236352218

a rope ladder   117.71301188592027
the wise unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing   175.4590716217105
i hope said aramis there are no women at your dinner   119.60901885480578
i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord   113.53621255397314
tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis   163.23038426716545
the latter had surpassed himself   62.849870582212375
i was obliged to sound a retreat toward the rue tiquetonne   171.81284295857756
aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends   132.12122380058426
go away as quick as you can maximilian said valentine and stay till i send for you   65.58790150084178

on the contrary do not look at him but at this   31.870677786698735
he arose and the abbé accompanied him to the door   193.18123767852086
athos came down   123.42129221402547
why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner   53.8136457939773

on entering the hotel d artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire   56.42825566598287
the london executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services instead   35.85429287306485
and as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the rhône from which it had its source and the post road it had depleted not a hundred steps from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description   61.92462271696192
but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility   160.75542875789282
but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long   120.57132891552591

he was alone again   146.26008756688398
and you say this young man behaved himself well   160.10620699041743
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires   81.60142318304412

aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them   199.12991321411596
i am wholly a stranger to paris it is a city i have never yet seen   25.41008293839174
the flight   116.82333712852649

ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising   64.99985570957182

i am not unhappy while i possess my son   154.5527152725963
and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss   99.17942592841686
the pistol i had heard had doubtless been fired at her   4.024085081808764
the family is extinct   130.31599251722955

the total amount was found to be as m   125.25883033410008
and rochefort went hastily out of the apartment   193.75676606789972
and they would be right pardieu   164.59395412084294
the bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before   26.06463829235871

confess how you obtained this animal   261.28080352625784
danglars intended travelling to venice where he would receive one part of his fortune and then proceeding to vienna where he would find the rest he meant to take up his residence in the latter town which he had been told was a city of pleasure   186.86741844106632
thus your crime known by two persons suspected by many will soon become public and as i told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the judge   121.3921320795188
short or tall   154.18408551431872
my dear franz m   200.8074137043228
the husband heard of the affair   135.35376850972116
edmond s hair stood on end and he rose to his knees   138.12009669367146
come   50.084278374843805
well this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house   128.32847384875888
your mother can be of no use to you in this world henrietta said the lady turning around   44.77849315208452
after some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention   58.22016900839056
happiness almost stifles me   131.3285683210676
only eat for a week and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful   39.26369630666727
but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years   44.71870865464031
he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain   145.33386825554803
the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort who bent his head in modest triumph   203.61780778172408
by no means   172.25603575025914
a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers   122.63364418134154
yes to be sure i am   83.57711007362462
thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his father s intentions were   157.86895098630532
i have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a european misfortune   135.2020799930561
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home   120.25154844186717
women say those things but never do them   96.51202318429725
death raps at your door it enters it goes not blindfolded but circumspectly from room to room   133.5208411512569
the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings   103.21251086781392
ah   221.84112891469385
can i have lost it   128.82174976464864
chapter 72   87.11492243631162
very well   223.69670476646834
they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst i opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd   205.6325469595347
aramis stooped to kiss the king s hand but charles clasped his and pressed it to his heart   134.8946755787698
they thought that nauseous   227.87874358224968
and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error   235.94430380905195
consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want   72.69200235055632
very well   150.03892468667883
yes   128.0998900987991
you leave me and you are right in doing so i repeat it you are right   129.76136249176741
it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly   155.70504246096647
said felton making a step toward the duke   175.1781443378938
75   131.01225657918133
badly kept i own but still you must not calumniate it for that   262.5166778017076
i hear a noise   78.5026095489205
anne of austria sought to read in mazarin s face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired   119.50008344397894
well said beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir   109.28903006553868
well what is to be done   165.7408582057216
they had formed a circle round the invalid   120.83062835006726
well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips   186.7840410048741
no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home   125.0793325984892
it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape   68.3751287803189
certainly i do   174.2042172241617
but not every one   158.96130808581302
but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes   214.0821287965435
the ballet was called poliska   31.307110066115087
that is rather too philosophical on my word morrel   113.43876382033172
it appears so said athos since here they are   65.77704100079083
it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night   83.48758320708754
d artagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewildered   53.22717755624334
this was now all changed   183.76935626773007
whilst mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to paralyze his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer   31.313802714603682
raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at senlis   42.12637846866265
it is very easy he went on with a smile   125.92671674252011
that is why i have filled this whole assembly with horror   70.06228681192964
leave me alone said aramis impatiently   119.56727052572289
we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin   65.06246298274048
to the sheets said he   210.7266432505927
peste   82.96763229205263
somebody has disturbed him without doubt said d artagnan   105.85285879661281
i had about a million in their hands but warned in time i withdrew it a month ago   83.14736952145029
yes where is this letter   79.37830194490729
replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the sorbonne and the rue de l universite   102.58336973149322
he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty   106.88801199599668
and i say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and i his son thank you for not using greater severity   121.03883243993067
exclaimed morrel with increasing anger and reproach you who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when i might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms   108.18666443239822
the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded   146.5111206883797
chapter lv   222.81019077336558
i m your man   164.7885522032687
then whispering to selim she asked what were her master s orders   132.37077831454417
replied athos   95.94459616753446
d artagnan cast a glance around him   210.0683570305955
his best known work is the three graces now in the louvre   95.40622724673912
asked gondy   87.82917550307575
and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do   83.85059280976694
is the abbé at home   58.83700236388074
i fully appreciate his delicacy said andrea cramming the notes hastily into his pocket   195.6882471922827
with what my father said just now   117.57773510560783
go then said the duke and return as soon as possible   155.32153472611353
how was he going to find athos   215.52554602787768
go on   146.32795332329442
i had three two of whom have left paris to go i know not where   148.91949441025878
your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it   23.654472668949325
and what does he mean by his news from greece   153.17034255165206
the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume   161.3117393509433
each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people   69.44052193027491
certainly   136.63046521145986
the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied   102.95779275164521
asked albert in the most sprightly tone   71.3207367844482
ah   113.08779957034253
but said franz in his turn interrupting his host s meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was   220.1599047152821
said monte cristo   104.82623968710858
remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below   168.0217402313969
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected   11.217658403867347
here is a little article on colonel fernand which if i am not mistaken would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary   107.34837795488545
dantès made no resistance   32.64138487532
said she starting at madame danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock   177.43340220904386
observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother her   54.60366709248666
you know there s only one way of saying things so i went in and said my lord we were not the strongest party   99.93498746206365
there the aspect changed   129.63751799300147
disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine   196.43063989595245
you surely are not in earnest   66.01225451641122
and yet it is important for the honor of my memory and this surely is not vanity but a justifiable pride it is important the world should know that i have consented by my free will to stop my arm already raised to strike and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others i have struck myself   139.10074524056907
the councillor broussel is being arrested   109.07265201040002
thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in a moment we were perched upon the croupe   89.96009162023553
yes yes signed noirtier   13.408615444777041
on the honor of a gentleman   112.62957852739095
after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocéens and read the semaphore   5.407084815453743
oh my lord   43.33607417535754
you hate the king   99.59762485863428
yes if we can   96.70648648547058
absolutely monseigneur   40.724614134970366
he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera   99.48707819157228
yes   108.10231642003806
another pause   182.34168621324991
the abbé started   202.22391552865614
but the three millions   183.93251159659275
two hours passed away without anything fresh happening   68.16342077828105
if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew   138.7076426097917
the point was then to discover the hidden entrance   28.529871220044797
you know it don t you   15.560323348686438
said d artagnan   119.56455258977748
yes my lord replied the servant m   33.150935925726415
said he on perceiving aramis   76.21315572642389
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs   46.13904688017848
do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing   184.79617376529222
and to make porthos contented there was wanting what   256.0431243377394
in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most   193.82764910335686
and i also said porthos   238.85544602789986
it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly   75.74641784172196
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him   164.15759090581153
he did not move as he heard it open and the door keeper pronounce the words walk in madame and then reclose it   39.46547274048369
and he drew out the handkerchief   81.55077092062268
but wait a minute said m   131.18965352950352
i bitterly reproach myself i assure you   59.53989113768712
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life   122.10766292561043
the streets were crowded for it was the day of pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers   162.61294041430105
but in everything friend one must always return to the same question a stupid one i admit but very necessary have you any money   18.86457136414799
the man in the red cloak chapter lxv   126.21192377697692
this fashion is coming in   190.26191967853066
i think that matters look very gloomy madame   101.09752858878178
why you must have lost your senses   183.35737630515433
de villefort   100.45475778704659
cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes   155.56466633961523
but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic beauchamp   150.09693267737887
you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out said the soldier   156.17303655177093
by introducing to you a new acquaintance   63.80415466242103
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met   121.82316515772756
eh who knows   144.29461541236552
one more turn captain   14.035973744628905
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness   62.83854478592623
but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller   11.842612698816993
as to d artagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards   217.1428761147169
chapter xxxiv   133.36165401022157
her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion   247.83835743590492
is your jailer gone   89.91051165737389
i will follow your eminence s instructions to the letter   137.18045909779815
said porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago   88.88984586306294
you are a precious creature my pretty hostess and i am much obliged to you   31.9457055547512
i will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my ambition   73.45452684742816
however the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness   75.92140199532992
at the first words of this address d artagnan had seized porthos s arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force   134.82075341510756
no gentlemen i have kept the harness said porthos   134.38367974505934
luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you   137.44901770150588
yes yes   141.1818408352142
the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares   111.38905391637037
for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn   190.4250585335225
you are the king of lackeys   52.22357432083457
noirtier and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference   107.3435060257954
stammered debray   115.59101492268302
as you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon   245.3029712520617
the carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace   135.89369291426715
i was in utter darkness   176.9953944914964
d artagnan who was by nature very curious as people generally are who possess the genius of intrigue did all he could to make out who athos porthos and aramis really were for under these pseudonyms each of these young men concealed his family name athos in particular who a league away savored of nobility   109.60388113892276
i once spoke to you of four men   126.59905417824737
it was just in time for valentine s head swam and she staggered   61.58886208175612
speak   43.042536929287024
i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua   269.29855559116504
raoul bowed   24.07979427838464
no high sounding words   90.02608484997839
end of the port wine mystery   43.557953998817325
there is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction   154.83192107995012
fernand s eye darted lightning   190.37261039123837
there he stopped breathless and panting   159.4833930272245
cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant   82.11333512985976
these were villefort valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken   75.97874894070996
still sir   12.075251122831162
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england   72.10426251286819
you villain will you finish   129.2645276301081
be not alarmed at what i say   219.6996836136384
in order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked   138.78810522073445
my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother   17.00729843561109
i had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment   102.46907945491056
when the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the festa in doors he took teresa quite away and as he left her at her home he said teresa what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young countess of san felice   130.45639821149973
said the notary   120.30492224090875
at last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness   84.44339359032307
you also stand aside he said to the masked man   38.75635359171392
ah yes true mademoiselle exclaimed monte cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought   6.427002555611097
you are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin   224.98402074187305
woman was created for our destruction and it is from her we inherit all our miseries   137.6313942068661
i told you said mazarin that you had seen the queen   170.88639020937
the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went out   199.1497099486934
but you expected some one then   146.86299532959748
do you think then monsieur that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece   83.23900934445268
can i be of service to your majesty   109.8691911834556
we will embrace raoul and perhaps he will have news of athos   122.33232065372
and did monsieur d artagnan come off the conqueror   142.83750560419298
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord   68.45959106228923
morrel take my word for it   87.70962278103511
muttered porthos shaking his head never should i have thought this of him   37.2125074849659
i do   23.59436390013603
no hermine replied debray   100.48826316278989
the servant bowed and retired   174.16447844005495
exclaimed the queen joyfully   201.13835292208262
asked the prefect   32.36810643977918
are you sure that the other is dead   198.7929573557475
mazarin turned again to his papers   115.1227147377293
come take them and monte cristo forced the bank notes into his hand   37.18362911871638
de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement   178.24826510106107
oh my beautiful sovereign a hundred times thanks   78.52712890964548
said athos pointing to mme   151.51929885244198
the diamond studs which his majesty gave the queen   116.3741574573522
which asked he the viscount or the count   130.01884653502486
athos wounded anew by cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way a foot   120.38684214274144
why yes replied d artagnan with embarrassment   48.71357539652712
the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south   118.65467698693531
then remarking the strange expression of milady s countenance she said pardon me madame   73.57322501085807
i have something to say to you   123.11495886192358
and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv   101.41500263543034
how can she be so   42.143547064150894
morrel said château renaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m   98.903124983352
you know there are different sorts   113.20566583011654
i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the arabian nights a wizard of the middle ages   162.9529177912384
enter my sister said the queen   109.23413352838195
if i am not yet a musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of m   88.71576950709016
cromwell s house   133.56483172735813
my good nanette be quiet i beseech you said broussel   115.10816447581148
i have no greater regard for the bastille than you   110.96527493238035
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father   41.603858590610486
exclaimed a commanding voice   103.01182468085472
the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination   124.19362457325889
how   232.84188669375894
and if i give you this password said she would you forget it as soon as you used it   204.8353137125986
de tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were dead   17.41771965392914
no but i know a little about wounds and mine i know is mortal   163.33330611124575
he entertains a very high opinion of m   79.95729488881702
but said grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins there   240.04512288210026
d artagnan thought of all these matters   135.78078928332576
you had better see him for his madness is amusing   214.8922924141207
you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows   79.12630756439478
that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either   171.08268815684966
about your own height sir   103.10858216409771
in england lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our reputation   141.64764304091378
the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him   106.67201668923538
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz   22.57164042465375
and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe   48.210236842664756
another i disarmed or wounded i don t remember which   157.90309397042148
mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by d artagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon which was near corbeil or bracieux which was near melun and of pierrefonds which was between compiegne and villars cotterets   141.35159566733248
she has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may obtain his pardon   88.81976956812431
said gaetano with a smile   89.99037648212385
oh sire   141.11603338207257
parry closed the door and approaching the king his face radiant with joy sire he said in a low voice do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise   97.21352962919802
château renaud looked for a moment for morrel   179.60025414496258
how do you know that   125.43184771601385
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her embarkation   129.79349279740995
20255m oh no said morrel   132.7785322004482
you have read the letter   142.88191222793722
i did not even touch your hand and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant   172.25173581112796
i have therefore as you see great need of hearing from you   44.884376802626335
said she   156.64893982945978
eight   174.87623802937838
go to work labor young man struggle ardently and courageously   134.61624742798662
jesus dieu   169.50378353982455
if that is really so how came you in the bastille   66.76315722262547
madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of anne and drawing her back madame what are you about   168.3947156584504
but should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be displeased   85.40633804019542
and danglars rose as if he meant to depart   185.76536312662358
mon dieu   176.77452436029046
that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and re counted is odious to me   105.03096539386458
which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety my dear duke when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours and that without getting in the least out of breath   304.03875532163795
i am sure of it   124.78548038256372
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray   166.80143459341235
before leaving the convent of the carmelites henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers   65.8320305489202
with being an agent of the bonapartist faction   66.21990080706547
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an avenger   115.48579417868642
franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by peppino   195.23921284079495
there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage   152.2387365313188
and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night   110.07556818385864
have you forgotten that m   134.45595151769024
the moon is just bursting through the clouds and there standing where you do and wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure you remind me of m   196.50380786367157
it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined   124.73710640142761
yesterday at saint germain as he came out from the presence of the queen   153.25119989821985
a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper   171.8027629246591
it s the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning   201.36554638753285
a propos said m   82.73879465001141
of the caresses of children so pleasing and so sweet especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again   90.30805207170692
now guess what the young one did   162.52599346525295
the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room   84.34911666175094
the sultans and viziers who rule over society there and who constitute what in france we call the government are really haroun al raschids and giaffars who not only pardon a poisoner but even make him a prime minister if his crime has been an ingenious one and who under such circumstances have the whole story written in letters of gold to divert their hours of idleness and ennui   129.70150843903517
gad he was not so proud then he was an under clerk to the good m   157.78302933277809
she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moment s reflection yes go florentin said she and may he come quickly   139.98753866032553
the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man   114.82848887871221
when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli   195.76880034926927
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us   141.8673657375298
they had no plan ready they must think of one   134.72573136144544
that man wait a bit   16.30686386718196
the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance   117.3488176301803
at the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written mirame a tragedy in five acts and raised his head   116.18430218206198
still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness   188.12222282657086
d artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding   168.94104907907015
and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him   118.00450529967493
and the duke pointing his pistol at aramis fired   115.14808529485083
in the first place you will sup with me will you not   129.9428759471385
de villefort   69.71908238241826
from her majesty as i think   33.67430923787941
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieille chapelle and la venthie   43.67143468372568
with 200 francs we can reach marseilles   132.12489472783676
our companions will be riding horses dogs to hunt with and a fishing boat   105.20623799400701
call him then   160.30672374726024
come he said if i pay you the 100 000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease   144.839231729628
but for me alone this is good enough   76.10858984669962
but she added poor angel whom that monster of a gascon barely failed to kill   176.29346820848914
my name is ah   198.15463974294963
aramis will follow us by that of noyon   113.90654698763532
i can not comprehend what induced you to buy three   39.46757188737065
what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream   89.45467176712894
excuse me albert sorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance   62.12262863995204
are you prepared   249.60763127896473
well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch   47.54615161243075
exclaimed the queen frowning   248.00973436375259
the sum was collected in a minute   157.38557709377494
then take my arm and let us on   46.50529884531949
said aramis   140.81805908950076
answered the abbé man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known   127.75448526504671
a cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my forehead   13.798096441574373
is there anything that i can do for you   103.13892660933581
athos shook his head   20.477450119574513
the four friends looked at one another   57.51923873207247
a benefit reproached is an offense committed   243.6517432578121
the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner   37.6471641402087
how dreadful   165.42133103182923
porthos said d artagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet   50.67189320381317
the repast was magnificent   124.37220782588479
but i am grateful i swear to you   86.00860125157226
tell him also that i am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at amiens   62.38892587475641
we shall know be assured   55.922575396411816
what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousand livres which he wore on his finger   69.12525816957765
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing   155.236259816443
haydée had taken away ali and bertuccio remained with noirtier   133.70566878564586
you must make some reformation in that quarter   155.62509688796305
porthos nodded in sign of agreement   34.28400172449639
how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you   197.15476149078359
so that he told me that poor monsieur maillard go find the coadjutor friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir   123.47497922549093
he would not die by what seemed an infamous death   153.1266335466642
ah count she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the rue meslay   134.9086972070343
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week   143.1426544605504
te deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout france   168.98512622364746
how ghastly pale he is   182.17135841494007
of whom   187.29951569975125
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for   153.55936892914616
if it is written yonder in heaven that the duc de beaufort is to escape he will escape   42.042768305553835
you are right baron answered m   189.8745381633488
it is impossible said the procureur   159.09992073064322
but morrel remained motionless   134.39126844574182
asked all the four friends   105.40183796651186
how do i know   67.21303272440522
they were descending the steps leading to the cavern   78.11208913311918
nothing nothing   209.13003019835637
he has lost five ships in two years has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses and his only hope now is in that very pharaon which poor dantès commanded and which is expected from the indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo   215.34641864016248
the rooms are all carpeted   153.99194536317634
will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king   156.15659487441297
his shoulder knots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it   146.9932334810636
that is what i hoped   98.55156504893304
i am not a priest   32.80511781151158
ah you have a noble heart said the count   110.83708329387099
the french army held all between pont a marc as far as valenciennes falling back upon douai   135.63420046121533
replied noirtier fixing a majestic look on the young man   268.4080146750324
that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized d artagnan by the arm and said if occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not   186.42768821445702
they were rapidly leaving the château d if behind   172.13932944605733
cried she hastening away with the young man   64.24485691314965
on the contrary my boy on the contrary i am pleased with your zeal   232.26385775474995
they halted for the king to dine   200.87741323701033
half a million said he magnificent   148.99084566828816
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival   173.4704206059567
but no matter   129.7653227353093
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs   166.722509489256
and had the pretty madeleine no news   20.018721354074017
bonacieux had opened his door and seeing the apartment had returned to the man in the cloak whom he had left alone for an instant   155.87791023642433
suppose the poison was for instance brucine brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not   118.88142423670153
50039m oh the magnificent hair   133.82564859789989
asked athos   155.19149169322998
said m   78.02498877005554
but unfortunately for the prisoners the abbé faria had an attack of catalepsy and died   92.91008924235561
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath   32.56464195338616
but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off   63.08035179664486
no sir   146.56122100585995
although almost engaged to the leaders of the fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a stepping stone   95.1158406077129
what did you please to say sir   152.83349212336265
but it was on leaving this club said he my father disappeared   56.41418400294081
i will give them to you   123.79596734377088
i am glad to see said d artagnan that you have still that honest lad with you   59.9646785196684
a ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the dead   98.67430157149948
resounded   132.75914547085154
said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated   151.53851132817715
that which we do not understand   93.64136386886871
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them   197.7398106391999
there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force   67.05094711603536
ah then you at length understand   28.67141505097598
the queen full of energy and courage was quickly alive to these two virtues in others   94.23634861267956
i have caused you to be named lieutenant   128.28868324752466
the pistol is blind   92.6392513849844
so make the best of it   159.96003237609864
noirtier sent for me i am ready to attend to his wish   229.87607602223886
what shall i do with albert   222.3877733465744
and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german   146.93230028014636
hold your tongue will you   83.78679590905875
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hope her only means of safety   85.9665162633396
let us see said athos assuming in advance a critical look   124.15897013836056
this niece comes sometimes to see her uncle   113.77349480145284
dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall   73.29306164036808
you say so   145.92340546266405
the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for d artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant   202.70726999264178
an italian from the neighborhood of mantua i believe   95.43320696476313
this is the last judge   187.27543566779474
but carlini felt his heart sink for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her   117.71141681794913
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him   41.23031341821071
de château renaud one of the best riders in france and m   81.1425384896121
well   65.82113917636582
tell me her name and i will give it   176.86846575002477
inquired the elder dantès   116.13726781073733
athos smiled   87.4654657444968
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me   171.37014103315832
then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m   41.172068748053235
the pistol fell from his hands   116.89779657356043
the feet did not bespeak the woman of quality   103.92937721757234
it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium   98.89123749260793
ali bowed in token of strict obedience   147.24022068483953
you must obey the king   46.091420125327204
and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman   282.99016238934536
remember that i write to you now to repeat how much affection for you i still cherish   144.73535410715954
may i be permitted to inform my wife   216.211570940207
i have just made m   50.81969348830994
d artagnan shows himself as athos and porthos had foreseen at the expiration of a half hour d artagnan returned   128.84294422169776
as he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely white   95.8014954314402
what the devil would you have me do with that   125.88930912040969
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids see our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun   40.287989914175526
no i really can not   193.01321078315138
e   125.55148118790383
i am for those who save the state said bonacieux emphatically   73.39433523041481
now said the old man aid me to bury my child   106.42149573834936
patrick galloped off reached the duke and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited him   172.66978980588127
deuce take it   180.41503030164748
plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven   173.63281116463145
said she   97.09026042304465
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it   19.3418471114001
you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth   61.72284414748938
then valentine s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds   103.59029712292514
but a glance from the worthy broussel who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind checked this foolhardy action of despair   233.34117083562313
the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerf s are you not   127.90747339919213
sir   122.39263625864919
d artagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman   179.2848357823202
this is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered   143.36169193285704
grimaud immediately obeyed   228.29185799395378
good heaven   227.18560853636654
my dear athos you view things on the dark side methinks   245.40573936353488
de villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them   0.9105666753306423
0093m true   62.8841521357986
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt   140.0151095961956
why in this way if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape   74.69395710790339
reflect then wretched man and repent   82.24125696775809
andrea got into the cab which passed rapidly through the faubourg saint denis along the faubourg saint martin crossed the barrier and threaded its way through the interminable villette   8.64256430174818
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine   18.304908629322114
i said aramis in his most flutelike tone i had made up my mind   117.91738482396981
no madame something easier to grant   117.81274473492893
and you are right said his host   135.50073136975155
are you sure in her conversation with you that your wife mentioned no names   169.79451222657678
lord de winter did the same   149.03844590213657
asked villefort   51.732289649131644
it does not matter   105.60462285370404
the donjon being taken i should be obliged to let them hang you at which i should be most unhappy certainly   90.25682412973639
there will be some one at hand to pick it up   135.435144117895
welcome to you i expected you   112.58363150514113
porthos bowed   214.02660525872722
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before   86.8964013618529
said de winter   110.76391872065484
said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings   152.18771109691255
and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my father s it was herrera   63.48109420314422
villefort took a chair but valentine remained standing by her father s side and franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his hand   204.39038251677914
my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself   68.35725767420234
indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable   111.50906709225981
destiny   117.00756354823619
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master   72.70410303420799
my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me   115.47924928813767
no no dear friend   91.58507082061313
cried the hollow voice of athos i can hear d artagnan i think   25.109678717242957
said morrel bowing   206.0794672542764
you must be mad   127.81208178443472
she wept abundantly   130.46202362974148
i say hers for she inherits it today   69.71737343228202
said d artagnan as he drew the letter from his pocket   41.06752732125625
i pardieu   69.40492770739871
he was a strong minded upright young man   42.60512488987362
teresa uttered a cry of admiration   129.11608988970784
the dappled grays volume three chapter 48   162.8228527421452
we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some orders i have given have been executed   116.96327259655621
the snare is rather maladroit for the cardinal replied the young man smiling   150.75198791940977
very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil   150.958452764109
my lord has perhaps no faith in those words   122.77151355005581
where do you come from   177.9286272200764
let her alone said he   138.5762199433807
muttered d artagnan   105.6031306275619
i give you the rest of tonight and all day tomorrow   137.49850096073453
monsieur d artagnan   137.84626165268668
i see your features regain their calmness your countenance recovers its assurance   131.9909409813314
and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present   51.971407930423425
now saddle the other three horses   73.56102001470353
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vain they opened again as soon as shut   55.431574760126225
louvieres recognized him and bowed   133.5755502797543
the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them   136.0769592125375
they don t have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four   138.94467862185618
if a question in heraldry were started athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom their genealogy their alliances their coats of arms and the origin of them   112.35196679396604
albert de morcerf is no coward   122.17703734204211
yes replied he while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and grace yes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove it   181.89326292819365
you will divide the money into five equal parts and give an equal portion to these good friends the only persons who have loved me upon earth   56.418175749859444
an abdication   126.72926658934512
you were writing   149.2511465617191
how long have you been here   63.38490392770738
oh how distinctly i remember that kiss   131.0387872728009
at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat   126.50453933233796
the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on   157.90328820794406
i entreat you continued villefort   78.6783211611305
he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything   208.10930675839904
the last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter   196.0030636662001
but he was never to be found at home   88.04041397538768
ed   144.5226444038296
let us hear   86.04653409515866
cavalcanti   98.25549087980806
d artagnan i am ready to follow you   182.37612753577278
thank you sir   163.2379797896699
the name of m   88.31679310894373
marechal de la meilleraie returning without a hat fontrailles with his arm in a sling wounded guards horses bleeding   211.6678559974484
well i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him   98.17431540507577
give me then strength to suffer   118.49918441898846
two or three years perhaps   43.70995763458511
alas he exclaimed how can i restore the happiness i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures   196.10667149313957
oh cried the inspector who can live here   47.63605724081316
i want faithful servants   103.02210561010313
the abbé busoni and myself have a small account open between us   78.01650699998412
cried milady throwing herself at his feet   94.45399533529832
so much the better muttered athos   153.79510768767815
thin and lanky   138.7100763921836
tis you who have named him as m   154.61006664179456
athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the parpaillot   96.33095029679862
the matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said rochefort shaking his head with an air of disappointment   49.51385420619016
if there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of athos   67.483810729491
40104m while albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived morrel who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye   68.36106161127861
0119m how long has he left it   62.164717604665924
what would you   226.85875327999514
7   100.03169874307454
a cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on end   211.14906213093423
if not unpleasant to you   158.45007009135867
and madame de saint méran her mother s parents who both love her tenderly   129.63222627628002
then assisted by bicarat the only one left standing they bore jussac cahusac and one of aramis s adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the convent   51.04490551007075
org   90.08838676557944
in what respect   18.466388042842553
the law has commanded and when it commands it strikes   115.89678595863629
who then am i   159.12089514252148
every instant mme   89.20441361066507
you heard cavalcanti   120.97333011959799
as soon as you feel able to swim we will go   78.32031552544045
oh villefort   57.99179273960924
oh for me   168.86864429961815
now in my turn let me give you my instructions   124.06687185920603
reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming storm and when they pass athwart a multitude presage an emeute   228.62800125215196
only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as i have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession   121.59554009753136
the return also of the conqueror of lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet   145.7952788472208
asked the marquise   67.41954491202712
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures   177.83073415114822
here is monsieur d artagnan   109.66937236043155
why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today   127.69618725215668
and shall we go and find him   139.2598453103004
women weep for the dead   180.11809298298098
without doubt the rioters are in prison and you come to tell me justice is done   37.10390626941994
yes said the executioner   199.06699244896205
permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of advice from thomson french of rome   201.0389995613644
you know not then anything of your birth you have never seen your mother   81.67202015273557
now as d artagnan used no ceremony with aramis seeing that bazin forgot to announce him he announced himself   80.26917787646697
she is all powerful yonder   88.41188171550522
why when all was arranged   36.37355892159711
monsieur d artagnan shall die   102.9813069313383
she was young you say   17.57390289616788
it is understood of course that when we say the queen mazarin is meant   201.64074263712507
at this moment madame de villefort approached   104.35878876537043
yes   72.08736260657552
what   53.14844342938477
yes nothing more true   140.92421642195868
and now gentlemen i repeat excuse me but on that account only and on guard   221.38950133957957
he then said it is time to start   183.26564110981104
they set out on vulcan and bayard followed by mousqueton on phoebus and arrived at the palais royal at about a quarter to seven   168.7880310644139
that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself   100.28327191529178
athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois   127.67198222025321
each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side   107.59979433942321
a few moments passed   217.9225414679646
i think i may venture to ask you this favor   100.03816201876155
athos arose   90.36322051529297
quick   183.40205191991305
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention   91.42256377041856
but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop   209.01794161699254
we shall have our revenge   89.99593286545189
i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m   163.17761520176362
the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the tumult   15.506390322208915
yes   132.5880312192102
a thousand francs sir   91.15743158379422
he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dantès jailer   121.46943940983843
but why did it not kill my father   215.68469483322014
i wish albert de morcerf and raoul de château renaud to be present at this signature   168.87529413840224
come do you really think you have anything to say against me   95.76978938723445
there they are   74.52119243870098
repeated mazarin in terror   214.57726572537473
i love edmond dantès the young girl calmly replied and none but edmond shall ever be my husband   242.42702109327558
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him   72.08940113318084
who is it   116.6236047518443
take the gate on the left   195.1111859009692
who and what are you   106.26141869189456
what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you   176.93841808932473
he was a berrichon thirty five or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but excellent   106.3160319185599
while his wife was speaking villefort had narrowly watched the old man s countenance   94.59186175570623
one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house   140.16987836839994
the letter shall be given to himself   26.268386183380215
blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to m   90.02776381768774
the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercédès   122.69379923783954
instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to st   199.36206065284205
let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes   96.26125662718856
probably not   52.2773229214401
and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he said monte cristo forget not monte cristo   93.9751072112019
god will punish you hereafter but i will punish you here   164.05366928940992
there is port wine in the cellar of monsieur le baron de bracieux   98.88985419416734
very little without you mother   50.75822135266216
yes but they are never used   160.66056682993616
the affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm   61.983323429170724
and he raised the medallion to his lips   97.58067495720726
there seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to her majesty the queen of england and if she engages to answer for us i presume we shall be allowed to enter   93.41727153809988
you know him   135.9863794002046
he wished to display his authority   82.05953031838649
come upstairs with me and i will give it to you   165.08892752210897
the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes   69.9913859170623
by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones   55.2457885231822
and yet said milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists   182.6511371199341
about a hundred tons   70.8254363172029
indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction   144.8068107497937
truly   75.25627523695516
then i went out of the house   136.62880714630933
then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress   149.55927147651363
sit down dear count and go on with your story   228.89193036067698
the place madame is vacant and although tis a year since monsieur de tréville has left it it has not been filled   45.4791531128341
you have hurt yourself perhaps said morrel   165.31524635397528
and provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine they will require no more of you   224.81651103922772
has not one of you a cross   57.66910581716548
he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand   9.517495466569443
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand   47.79383578010763
la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing   162.26475708349147
are we not eating a horse porthos   258.10565632954706
oh yes sir he told me   20.587854176177814
i will not fail   117.72163768369407
ah that is different   82.92227603350713
d artagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made his untimely entrance   181.28132259046723
the musketeers hastening to the hôtel of m   122.21188292879114
ask porthos   67.9591184124265
ah   188.73354956557336
you are right   136.33588515477874
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts   131.8832834450373
what do you say to that   122.63087388111032
this must be one of your friends   181.34797921581992
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker s feet he could not have experienced greater terror   159.88515278128347
mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry long live mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on porthos   204.26731753646555
give the lackeys money and they will start   70.90477261775034
i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body   174.36883463759168
he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive   161.30154333208247
it is he who should have watched over you he should have occupied my place he should have emptied that glass he should have risen against the assassin   104.81653151967997
alas   77.49121304382993
he is at the siege of la rochelle with the cardinal   200.70172251158488
but you first came to breakfast did you not   79.2518777303179
well my dear dantès are you now free   213.9400352460857
good heaven said planchet what a misfortune   158.30994802281376
ah yes   86.09949039445885
continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies   122.68310947272404
do you speak spanish grammont   122.77991763304027
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents   100.38835834680995
she exclaimed   156.39367490438627
but d artagnan remained impassible   155.5043325004895
the result was that when the new comer left the hotel with the cicerone a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers and without having been seen by the traveller and appearing to excite no attention from the guide followed the stranger with as much skill as a parisian police agent would have used   131.67174155022104
take care that the french do not take their revenge on you for the sicilian vespers   91.58102239032284
will the petition go soon   62.50593129470994
i was not sure but i thought it might be so   123.55554293800539
on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so secure   130.5767164329907
it is done   19.698242947273783
all four besides immediately broke off their conversation   135.1223765681522
a little sooner or a little later it isn t worth quarreling over   168.4644141434257
then let me go said maximilian or i shall think you did not love me for my own sake but for yours   189.71641606979145
de villefort be for all your goodness   109.79684847308599
well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the legion of honor was announced in the papers we were all sitting with my grandfather m   191.93587600647612
all four came up together   48.770927111449055
and this costume a ball costume doubtless becomes her admirably   112.44061078713263
the duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his heart   47.217231969433286
i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of bracciano s but also return to florence alone   165.09551170489812
you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into   88.00049642533763
you think you were   215.10213715352933
aramis shook his head   68.02397270864834
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door   167.10528729264777
luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind   108.28433168021166
it is my turn to be of use to her   70.72616745448845
you are a careful fellow edmond   180.5327112138584
the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven   7.5186956111734276
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening   63.95909351354837
but if he be a spy what do you think a spy would be about here   136.93468083986272
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound   26.96487751265471
wait a minute then said aramis   170.78007227408872
asked athos   52.247356825683624
it had been handed down from father to son   82.47927450355834
but in case i feel disposed give me some particulars of today s executions   233.9150905323176
let us see said d artagnan   141.31180700144554
this means sire replied the cardinal that i was desirous of presenting her majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself i adopted this means of inducing her to accept them   100.73366801189019
that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood   141.27717941721096
in a splendid chamber of the palais royal formerly styled the palais cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers   116.35208238875128
40280m i   123.12474341079528
come in said monte cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion   127.7288253908608
and delighted with the success of his embassy friquet started off at the top of his speed   93.09769019622149
he pointed his finger to the lighted window   137.26946821605404
at these words bertuccio turned pale   205.01920977584
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges   101.80969061366372
she required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order   145.3844103207947
who knows   255.7876253914295
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep   95.56682453130358
pyramus and thisbe chapter 52   71.74251482755705
alas monseigneur   132.40906612573664
conclusion   84.8891905762425
d artagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire madeleine to come upstairs   140.60690118279217
well i shall write to the abbé   245.97748581761547
bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of her   189.35014297989795
because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me   150.75087835454627
and he shouted with laughter   208.652072955191
all the same it is well to be certain   72.61426724562135
oh no   34.562074951554834
i must have been mistaken   172.59223204317038
now then said d artagnan this is something like   133.37642939503746
hello lovely damsel   152.0578645200235
that is all i can say to you   139.55018937470368
ah said the marquise de saint méran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun   80.05721390320309
they saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned   72.36520628083306
said the host aside   123.08976990947019
and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting   187.59654957968993
said she   162.4466555933462
uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather   96.46092733430525
you have turned pale and then red successively three or four times in one minute   50.461342719942564
but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person   97.39176596927896
i don t think the sides are equal   65.68912026730419
he opened the door quickly   98.68550159145926
i have said monsieur and i repeat that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket   94.19645686991518
i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel   90.29667770313145
i suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket   69.83564876219894
tall well made   188.6448736653085
my friend said my mother when your master s orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not   200.2177334203564
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at d artagnan hatefully   287.4127198282208
d artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question   210.04136522463565
they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons   140.8156179811408
you think i shall deprive you of those three millions said danglars   86.16879022704045
if so he will have achieved a noble work   124.1121138912709
who can say whether d artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal   6.050264253522741
yes   151.5075312990793
and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent said aramis   80.47942024295394
and lastly because i fancied i had found my cæsar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me   31.155095388437843
they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the feet   30.891448654627098
he was in a court surrounded by high walls   81.45401635574942
beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind   125.33293608488599
i will come myself   72.26629401052267
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message   72.72430866201205
oh madame said mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask   103.11422563924117
stop a bit   127.87833515982211
his lips again moved   244.24331484527457
she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same time   7.228972721237085
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg™ license as specified in paragraph 1   138.0214502655453
signor pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia   200.12920163186976
dantès noticed that the captain of la jeune amélie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so   139.74933205069868
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them   131.17681656689106
only let me know where to find you that i may not run needlessly about the neighborhood   153.97968101184077
there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point   107.42006230817668
because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above them   14.247476279260866
from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep   121.11623949084462
imprudent thrice imprudent   176.85280471473436
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos   138.03170524282768
on the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to morrow   197.28957475039292
oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere   233.36240174063497
mademoiselle de villefort is the culprit she is the poisoner   171.44368383538048
wait said monte cristo i wish to take one final glance around this room   198.85909647494924
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall   60.897228231666915
e   124.48492075045353
whom would they hang yourself or me   124.07808750660999
then we are upon the fugitives   194.99973634408653
arras was encumbered with fugitives   131.5627300865469
athos talked of the discretion of grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth   257.1060650179202
possibly   163.96731800243523
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that d artagnan was not an ordinary man   50.94287644428397
doubtless   202.86785208920855
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service d artagnan   1.8687052383241252
but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man   97.42490366634269
you appear quite aghast   48.63173547985778
he was resolved to unravel the mystery   83.87239775173327
and you fellows resumed mousqueton stay near monsieur le comte d artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst i go to prepare my lord for his visit   147.28561565813334
how can you doubt it   85.18050288907202
the apartment of m   168.5489059153031
but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom   4.294706499570097
listen then   145.78599123156744
do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me   101.38271456052087
and even if she were to be seriously offended i could well understand it   45.010626017217376
you decide then nothing about me my lord   145.24795140884183
the towers though solid and as if built yesterday were open and broken   27.85029669941575
no one   182.51564065300002
know you again   46.643610976308366
to the seine with the officer   52.58675767509939
eh monsieur   101.55186036699659
i am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner   229.31301275055685
i am pleased sir to hear that   77.37555290721116
yes   235.33271381245055
it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened   42.44653699044561
but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor   214.82145632638463
will you come   93.3500893194842
the musketeers saluted bicarat with their swords and returned them to their sheaths   150.53846225486498
what is that news   191.79687033979386
did you doubt it   193.498154850679
there came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded d artagnan and planchet   238.88614129614265
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return   141.09693831429144
that makes in all   118.4269977176185
my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it   123.64594753563041
how do you mean   73.28183079981994
and i tell you that i will save you yet   30.456791392792496
it would have been remarkable   111.03629232511392
and the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies   87.55514280133835
what do you mean beauchamp   99.36528683133058
d artagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between them   54.72710659334018
said d artagnan seizing the letter   151.01685641258166
he found kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her chamber   142.81477324042865
thou hast prospered and grown stout   106.19443961675839
go to the devil   161.11770416383027
porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend   171.4109224296705
will you sell him to me for that sum   102.81807229713762
planchet stopped short staring at d artagnan   191.12492641349638
and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times   189.4090802463022
we have no need therefore to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing   105.00254287364228
i can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own   185.19006286777315
felton blushed   112.74300077878536
i am satisfied madame that he did what i have told you   103.86538731563569
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits   67.11241898140544
and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone   198.93391782460066
remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors   48.96426701681966
at the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed   90.84376408437058
aramis colored imperceptibly   154.20894190375915
what matters it to you kitty   213.98665490679036
because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you   205.35207281151264
i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours   189.80821068827407
i am no longer hungry   116.90587791456164
martin and the fort of la prée   197.97445570525431
ah   34.35583513158322
she did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the cottage   64.35150684898959
then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he said the prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday   142.72325905740217
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling   239.83034944349845
he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste   89.5823159399121
only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself   188.1918004585787
he has been here since yesterday   84.57217869264647
i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops   7.811481673878703
help   39.891235734607875
i have sailed over it since my childhood   163.30197695278025
we mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant   152.305349852083
do you pity him   83.24268678507768
it was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at la rochelle   182.6267229559673
i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them   183.18023889213822
grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture   115.09253741683851
my friend the cardinal   121.81931179806956
like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind   143.87846990323183
i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo   84.56765258358773
why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice   98.60194136076777
monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left   139.35251849190877
i am ready   136.5286720566442
these gentlemen should file off into normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach paris   135.51873618112822
he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort   120.25136670778878
the three musketeers did likewise   120.56443052513376
then said d artagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as lord de winter desired us to do   208.26147113565912
then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an altar   96.32295831742472

the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg saint honoré and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen garden of about an acre   40.369935829946485

when he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence   56.732243525676836
de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden   180.73707630287754
d artagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace   192.36534144747816
oh man   176.90518323444508
the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house   48.10727871093552
de villefort s communications on the subject were very limited and concise   125.94569228522033
oh good lord   162.92087101495835
he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between m   78.38591277759008
the result was that to prevent mm   160.27929965657697
anne questioned d artagnan by a look   99.10459232736348
and m   97.64433835313095
i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison   75.7167512820836
porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street   40.86441103088612
his devotion to the queen was boundless   96.31023781437466
to you no to you alone   64.4436449983571
on his part the king returned to his apartment   229.22070506715187
scarcely however had he touched edmond s hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house   116.8589727957665
s   160.16100380103543
m   102.47826880520756

he   0.5798152299826569
i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat   152.29721698419593
but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat   52.838423415933036
and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of caderousse   48.30542097486975
yet i think i hear her piano   1.6475661402813273
then turning to monte cristo he said prince cavalcanti is a charming young man is he not   75.68867217473783
besides he knows that valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of m   170.58133088865313
and from that moment she has followed your steps watched you feared you and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes m   206.1276374586098
look emmanuel   43.908189570458546
on the contrary that simplifies the matter greatly   114.14465632161725
even his breathing seemed to be arrested   176.2133200837486
i am lieutenant in his majesty s musketeers said d artagnan and consequently your superior in everything   111.59252554198963
but see there is a postscript from aramis   2.8486229594781776
the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wharf   41.65853512829602
i need you no longer   23.619040614987895
as for porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them   79.2280416438279
oh no replied caderousse that i can answer for you did not   135.29931798510617
a delay would save my honor and consequently my life   58.47924628404082
i don t wish to see anybody but you   23.40725201798503
in a second i had disinterred the box   135.01786893432177
at this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air and the two travelers could see displayed in all their brilliancy the large eyes the vermilion visage and the eloquent smile of mousqueton   194.30152545989566
it has returned count exclaimed morrel   200.36083458008386

while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above   114.57759337271015
as many thousands as you give me hundreds   124.686475873716
and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint   21.1183868038559
but dress yourself   124.49836226223456
the vessel was very old to risk that said the englishman   77.28216250288081
asked the queen well madame replied the valet i followed them as far as the gates   80.06526498746243
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account   187.2373423536239
who are you   213.83546878458736
aramis found athos and brought him   149.5042653802558
this costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in 1830   165.7818084110537
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke   104.24053930179211
in particular there is one yonder of a gascon look   137.59484095593527
she is in safety in a convent   119.14575452439237

in losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from olivain the emotion his face might betray   173.20000330575277
let us drink my dear d artagnan morbleu   63.53398789394316

monsieur de beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited   275.19694972499315
however ill our two friends were mounted they were soon far in advance of their servants and arrived at crèvecœur   183.788493241112
half in gold and the other half in bank notes if you please said the count rising from his seat   67.8732506634785
and i said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it   96.88518738234136
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor   151.08378110829767
shivering for want of a fagot   76.49431027254828
here said he i want to show you the kind of passport which i have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life i consent to leave you   226.2284341757949
but give us your word that you will come too d artagnan said athos   59.08019407792976
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity   200.22041531033335
look well at that man   114.47231643276437
then i should like to have three sons   45.735404898261464
to saint helena   155.71230798689732
madame coquenard said porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which i preserve engraved in my memory   91.49270429880194
inquired mercédès eagerly   159.9861411714785
he supped he went to bed   7.505920639790105
yes by a blow of your fist if you can   229.7990685033368
in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back   147.58881399948953
and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own   113.76991397476947
scattering money round about him as heaven sprinkles rain   141.05425770815557
in the morning i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence   208.07250047573666
your highness had already expressed that wish said bertuccio and the horses are ready   153.01683915353317
these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government   136.79327877701732
probably   142.39895886610554
de tréville s surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the ground   154.15102966916575
he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the door of his study opened   107.77127447992933
that is of the first importance   93.3736141271644
m   94.28839358048009
i mean because he wants petting   221.227927825518
he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals   129.1842353305019
then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses and we see the carnival in the carriage and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol and proclaim us like curtius and horatius cocles the preservers of their country   62.41062875800819
cried the stupefied musketeer   172.23536288039705
andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have no   155.4272157209298
you arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company   218.28634273340302
ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbé s two hiding places   102.96483446255742
i forgot to ask you where are you taking me   163.28858443159393
and andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder   150.6747736742611
he would not take them   139.4843613362188
i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of 4 000 roman crowns about 24 000 francs   46.224841214889295
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m   75.06683782640228
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there   216.55222497025676
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each other   145.24090608090359
i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity   144.71557672754162
well be it so then   45.04576836676932
go on with your affair monsieur cried planchet   99.15330517985262
they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study   102.18476765635447
the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his   153.04530589664978
pooh pooh   34.879939231364986
you are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear maximilian   159.67834917740797
oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened   168.72898934264578
germain   99.66975216952261
as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance   67.74163267146301
said another   22.03335991238211
caderousse shrugged his shoulders   172.43593052016718
by whom   29.227327215821248
cried athos   100.32027454859504
i see fresh tracks   120.21647534113967
she asked d artagnan if he had a mistress   137.3861047851948
stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out   145.60933888866066
here we are said monte cristo   143.6102616626157
this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franz s countenance   125.50071513804957
why should we load ourselves with a useless burden   134.2855620623502
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of d artagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle   186.6344144592685
in arithmetic   231.67301928182837
he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler   14.98649423962489
so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty   65.2286356270194
no monsieur it is impossible   115.9593868119888
i shall return very safely to the louvre all alone   101.49552742947239
he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself   56.91411614009702
but i come to offer you a dress which will become you still better   181.98133078427747
and besides she added her eyes troubled and moistened with tears wait wait fernand   111.11763787089967
and said villefort is it at your house in the champs élysées that you receive your visitors   107.82397732121363
athos moved toward the door   104.95278186421322
de winter remembered the monster that milady had been   156.39814810546434
he turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence   128.43782918624552
and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us   142.56272256650323
the journey chapter 86   49.26125109508264
cried morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage   134.78111801870568
art thou a messenger from god   90.08719573597028
well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die i shall require nothing   156.76737946825648
and where did you get so much money   213.78491257785407
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses   86.37707683047321
but this smile soon disappeared and returning to the adventure of meung tell me continued he had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek   168.5417684750468
morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment   134.85889402590226
why if today before eleven o clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve o clock to declare himself a bankrupt   114.1625895572486
ma foi spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies   78.43098792391982
then too i confess i should not be sorry to come across mordaunt again   98.71300614739104
he was a simple looking lawyer s clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener   32.96746058249697
the king s   48.04564102514124
he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles   116.66563770575614
that is well   59.16136953840123
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on d artagnan but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face   58.32928491070154
when you see one prisoner you see all always the same thing ill fed and innocent   252.38563724754349
well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain   129.3731152436683
the door is opened to all who knock   59.0430320570325
i did not even draw my sword but i took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the window   166.86211779031066
and your majesty has a good memory   55.08099668944186
but she as her only reply drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him   102.77758163677318
but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family   193.55217215256698
half an hour will suffice to apprise them   127.56856294814804
said debray to franz   83.13433266899598
we shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection a dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she fears   121.17690956101535
everything was here arranged in perfect order   41.0499875241909
faria followed him with an excited look   73.55319488772038
it means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the palais royal   234.53027358454727
a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him   110.68343572089358
what must come is written   165.89882408221422
d artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son kissed him tenderly on both cheeks and gave him his benediction   95.79577921665783
then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron   35.81310721637787
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation   207.89625473739807
proper names are not in the dictionary   102.18251169755132
by the lord my good host   154.9457035595174
but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering   8.195738585099932
the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet   137.07945428670848
grimaud nodded the third time   186.790956192215
i will go said comminges   157.59959272420005
40122m have mercy on my child sir murmured villefort   134.05086489083664
let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures   219.84116454140639
on arriving in paris d artagnan found a letter from m   138.70689533334635
for god s sake tell me did you know this englishman   75.23659469619311
shot my dear boy   64.0850276674847
sometimes   141.5457514785672
but still we have quite lost our dear eugénie   137.76742649351007
these details will guide her on her part and on your return i shall perhaps have some good news to tell you   117.99786510066599
and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times d artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels   140.7823318534395
as soon as he arrives inform me   16.209144372294077
it was a large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already a fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of september   136.1169613017154
i have done with him all that could be done   192.55742167497993
if you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to god   113.87516029905775
said the count simulating total ignorance   121.15687272341331
nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears   128.30658127881634
but i excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven   133.97224592264544
i do not remember what he did but i have inquired and i have been told all about it   197.5596873251565
morrel that s the whole truth on the honor of a sailor   155.72857107371942

here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him   132.88815072927005
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the king s name that they would stop as the king was hungry   94.31684504006218
you will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it   192.12457505415534
said the host to himself   68.3806440900808
yes   23.6776603241334
leave me then to act and have no fears for the result   55.82188184802978
but the count did not answer   16.984678970875322
m   138.04956115831163
asked the groom   194.7694187680827
but wait   89.92396548636472
said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect   176.78351702089805
no   119.8513365978015
said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero   142.7465523405044
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death   106.20974070428338
but a strong hand pushed him back and the carriage rolled on   68.73130794559275
bonacieux expected him   173.8219847338422
i will answer for lord de winter as for myself   140.1946041737413
i will join you again at marseilles   56.31965588333108
he retired to his toilet   28.51708942099461
said he   95.02714756333982
if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemy s line and throw ourselves into the tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming   132.06935620951515
but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs   142.66393449902944
your mother has no longer either throne or husband   79.56203398505971
morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards valentine through the opening   135.95389259802042
it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatigued   86.4048351501748
outside this door a spade was placed against the wall   34.11400027042039
d artagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities   187.29789902684303
you guess well   86.68292073318474
have you ever seen the queen of england   162.17407401955677
it is not worth the trouble   81.65737504351188
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit   33.92048274563608
a few dingy olives and stunted fig trees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict   142.0445194975551
the principal thing is to know which loves money the best   32.30743930456663
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry   152.42218426138876
he was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal s bodyguard   183.02320150931035
but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly   87.33056160288153
one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting   184.02150702531995
we shall not interfere with each other your object is a title   56.2227803093498
but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible   135.3582313253583
your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here   98.19796151396324
this evening to morrow always   57.573698772879546
do you come from the end of the world   156.1917482344394
of what companion are you speaking dear constance   84.98331329063582
that admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king charles i   72.14498624066773
for you without question inflicted four upon the dear gentleman and he is still very weak having lost almost all his blood   154.20515012375998
madame de villefort became very pale and seizing her son s arm drew him anxiously toward her   131.52374201954322
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the king s bed ready to die for him   142.36436183464016
but why into five parts   109.44773971404659
now escort me   140.8414991597656
ah   159.1704604149333
never mind where it comes from said porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink it   158.11165000797993
morrel looked obedience to her commands   114.20573464392515
i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france   105.44900300464887
good luck to you   90.95151614498296
exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband   205.7035260650636
cried porthos   96.24244851276981
yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so   151.6430768753734
well said he do you still doubt   197.01510010877627
without accident   169.97102851290373
the caves of the small   101.76146338333123
de morcerf   213.3939236792006
the young girl raised her tearful eyes towards monte cristo as she said with touching earnestness whether we return to the east you mean to say my lord do you not   11.97798637499369
there will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said d artagnan contentedly   58.6867486754261
never said the englishman   94.43506214096287
everything goes too well porthos   170.3070890508516
said felton   79.53541153520939
both the great king and the great poet ought to have known woman s nature well   161.4368667595816
his back was turned towards me so that i could not see the expression of his countenance neither should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hands   39.50477438952356
i say my dear d herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan   73.20272685402368
the house of thomson french   96.28044531809289
peppino remained breathless   118.47172938974586
i tell you what my dear fellow said château renaud i can not imagine what objection you can possibly have to mademoiselle danglars that is setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank which by the way i don t think you care very much about   71.81517306165924
meddle with your musketeers and do not annoy me in this way   198.32300030865747
chapter iii   185.1026899783835
cruel enough if i am guilty   54.12820350887011
ah valentine said maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that i may have the happiness of kissing it   138.81535977490915
certainly   74.11472233888286
look   121.0286565535697
have you had another fall at the bourse   89.90502057398469
eh   182.148593318996
he had a haughty bearing a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial   80.95011678856767
he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything   93.76230570965114
now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly   201.10220554035953
the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information   135.61290517214044
as he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her   205.2264814035999
after having lost my own horse nine against ten see how near i formed an idea of staking yours   89.84091067925259
well   159.382862121355
what i mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never changes   88.31523045085602
do you hear   95.98230864637797
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair   128.76811873198946
there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house the only title i desire with respect to you   216.18726373439623
morrel shuddered   46.694579467288605
to whom does this island belong   107.37327025740171
bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence   77.80023401206823
however jacopo insisted on following him and dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust   69.1655104823498
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another   95.51414124741784
i shall not be sorry to see the face of an acquaintance   124.2242723223294
he had therefore plenty of time before him for noisy is only three or four leagues from paris on the road to meaux   128.1200714857826
20027m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose   62.276673740892
it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way   63.29602015448553
only imagine but do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no   158.56403175862778
de villefort was therefore obliged to request m   81.8418324720418
well will you take me or shall i take edward   3.2908388415765017
but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la réserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart   200.0637280078104
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor   112.60443121794371
gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach   119.83763170150172
said morrel what has become of her   121.66533359796236
the prince procured for marie michon the dress of a cavalier and for kitty that of a lackey   145.53454506294662
by heavens   103.23157053926582
d artagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him   22.973381022980107
that s true   33.026342177168885
only a few men remained   11.346476421882187
30241m lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog   127.47226042470535
indeed   64.54399457264397
d artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward   128.25696452488242
the sergeant drew near to planchet   257.505010722267
bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe   112.71286756910587
but then you yourself are known to others   75.74501375395013
asked athos of d artagnan   236.55313261005045
my dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculous stupid   131.24210679061312
the other in the rue de la harpe no   106.83247778193301
the division being made by the light of bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis   3.5763971466215168
he fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report   25.097387223767328
no   21.55783919660564
d artagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the chamber   41.292529109173074
i was four years old   117.74130764399484
my captain is dead   99.76735837076134
faith   90.00995907623148
d artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his courage   8.025829544464031
thou good mousqueton   35.08349696891146
but on the contrary and it is i who say it see enemies in all directions   102.61334770175719
doctor d avrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall   135.7446171700458
but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might   216.57459649356835
murmured the cardinal   138.2246083991957
you annoyed count   64.4321058174155
then fixing his eyes upon grimaud with a singular expression the dying man uttered the last death rattle and expired   141.23665498062743
yes his mother   121.86187860939614
remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service   171.76818179021944
upon my word child   77.51627317753282
yes   126.89543398378974
oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and i know you   192.3993064216744
ten times as i told you he came to see dantès father and offered to receive him in his own house   76.82425500215007
you are welcome count   95.34991334884803
hatred is blind rage carries you away   204.07130034342873
meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos   214.44816088275624
and why presently   147.68893072381763
i know it but in asking for news i mean have you done anything for me   152.9547058156415
i will no longer detain you m   74.16374468102627
oh yes yes   203.21405510924603
it is incredible   68.33904231057804
at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right   198.78254175808374
months and years rolled on   51.07832731404436
yes assuredly replied the minister   134.28401140400152
oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile   123.90302116521251
woman is sacred   154.520527802772
said the young girl   146.49914037875524
hold your peace porthos don t remind me of it   88.5035872441716
you are coming my boy   11.25012864393588
you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man   91.18846241282284
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say on   189.0014828476772
m   88.47386285436458
he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise   93.81132870136042
you see said raoul we have done wisely   172.66908635267814
what   89.70905656463665
make haste and dress yourself   16.64968594099163
no no cried bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall   24.292814714589838
no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor   106.35074131180038
no but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man   200.24904525355697
for me   104.17515122676645
well just as you like my prince   109.8255164554895
really my lord you are his nightmare   13.93899581663743
i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other   151.57495353963463
and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles   223.49092315343776
do i lose by that   181.8506284914633
said the musketeer   77.0181448770511
humann section of the indirect contributions corridor a   227.7546311740873
there is nobody within said bonacieux   120.98996285668288
when i say i want i mean the queen wants them   139.67878326697505
you know noirmont do you not   159.42444001404036
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction   68.68419066725396
yes   27.881947351010922
as queen catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous broussel to them i will strangle him with my own hands   79.76977140959252
very well then said mazarin   151.2491138695504
i see that you are right logically speaking said maximilian   154.90914059439365
no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile   75.12845003261288
you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day   223.81768150399574
international donations are gratefully accepted but we can not make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states   57.16519391632491
the several members of that group were much excited   92.6799701766837
the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor   21.92464936973181
a friend said monte cristo in the same language   101.94183071252303
answer sir exclaimed he   140.97899010901332
did you observe anyone during the first act   142.95088970746687
low born fellows   118.09954145756903
the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent   101.09837574022964
it was the man of meung   135.08468086761386
seven o clock had just struck and m   27.32829483740889
but yet m   102.75893997704286
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell   19.692969557187155
i am at least fearful of it   127.65786684627102
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners   243.5725434951841
sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen   205.52919285124244
it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family   161.22999224038455
it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage post horses   93.23923441205235
and the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at louvres   46.09399201770971
but d artagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it   21.945175813166372
why so   0.44270823049437524
but he did ward them off said de rochefort and the reason was that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends   144.24405644520007
then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures   223.9121332793361
wait patiently then   133.235043607183
yes   114.82396411916717
i tell it   205.58838819485402
he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his temple   98.12146084500148
in the kitchen   141.78073793180474
for this envious person is a real enemy   52.20863871650228
well what has happened to them   135.94801367051534
he however darted not the less quickly toward milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron   166.42392175251086
said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame   232.96698882997657
never   25.179184071360453
i am pleased with one place and stay there   55.20105722794128
stop   131.39122801558503
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women   141.67626873499444
bazin gone the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be sure that nobody could either see or hear him and opening his ragged vest badly held together by a leather strap he began to rip the upper part of his doublet from which he drew a letter   121.01540362496951
you are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable   125.50397200402435
why   56.99650416736393
he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony   133.82229046929632
how   119.94383535474095
where is the monk   64.92797055922694
yes   12.549770610036973
well so much the better   130.97930435682306
besides my friend d artagnan has something to say to me privately have you not d artagnan   83.9164832845315
at this moment grimaud came in   75.69422307030982
planchet and fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor   151.39949233729067
de saint méran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship   103.9448221672111
with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentine s room of which he double locked the door   97.78105795904695
mazarin felt a shiver run through him a chill even to his heart s core   216.962208848337
pardieu   101.6060980283485
the queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the princess henrietta   111.69935161907362
albert ran to fetch a carriage   36.6933636714694
it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the contrast   3.4056462067824356
what orders   34.58489080574007
before his departure the count went to haydée s apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care   79.20542175515058
recall le plessis bellievre villequier and d erlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the lys   170.82021814253167
i am one of his most faithful servants   164.05679041158746
mazarin smiled but became very pale   175.03158115529777
what do you expect to get   103.7304467888275
at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter s voice crying out sword in hand   177.90878384472958
that s my masterpiece   172.22611104862338
you shall have no weapon left in your power   168.51400586893035
but dantès knew it and had often passed it situated twenty five miles from pianosa between corsica and the island of elba and had once touched there   103.65746145562777
gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar there s the enemy approaching   99.38259331574623
but oh how i passed that time   222.289660435038
at length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him   138.0571912446662
he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name   218.88603624162977
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement   65.53304498082215
of how many does it consist   161.14702484435782
murmured the voice   57.879072872443025
my lord replied athos for myself i have nothing to demand   167.80517424122334
the party was to take place at st   27.67513556802136
it is likewise well situated neither too near paris nor too far from it   166.74013159546286
said porthos let us hear what he says   144.59615601486917
let us ride onward   154.18182244103315
yes my officer   26.377011490494553
so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened   254.55239175634284
then from the bench she went to the gate   131.14868606555564
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch   57.81675348143642
oh traitors that ye are   97.00891844543132
for a thousand pistoles   11.00323940443269
dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings   141.79156817278138
to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible   80.90842642381837
but tete a tete   150.45268131040004
m   92.00888739507647
no it has been stolen from you   82.05099662197478
but the face i had a large hat said aramis   74.46638482108449
i sought out the best fencing master in paris i made an agreement with him to take a lesson every day and every day for a year i took that lesson   234.5148354850296
planchet emboldened by the first exploit sprang upon lubin   126.94012882664347
but but   106.91466730864653
and then he was called fernand   90.82623966278086
oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs   101.27969917799469
go and see mercédès and afterwards come to me   190.04262720697955
a captain is nothing but a father of a family charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary family   180.50932487184198
that is a minister who will hold office for six months   42.28162433056514
the executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping upon his immense sword   85.0404246977071
gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect i presume to keep me here a long time incognito   112.12644405146838
i heard the chevalier d herblay say so   184.81255269982142
follow me mr   166.95895717092571
i thank you for having insisted on seeing me   77.27657760864237
but you are not one of us said porthos   127.29369227074979
never   149.53722889262323
well said beauchamp   214.3607782970533
if you have any preference you can point it out to me   173.7345528659041
their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other   65.11801702258911
i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me   98.37071058091495
why it is after one o clock   171.16974533568128
morrel had better go do you not think so grandpapa   64.26485614116359
albert bathed took his supper and went to bed   140.84011427218138
he said and put it in his pocket   149.45356568001117
do either of these gentlemen know where he is   111.0515451407427
the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets   170.61862994661627
go   79.2264918478972
oh plenty   100.24500090735015
d artagnan offered his arm to mme   87.32200715497333
the salon in mahogany and the furnishings were of blue velvet   146.13762914106127
my papers thank god no my papers are all in capital order because i have none   143.99033945465055
reflect athos   253.35983361130258
cried morrel   135.52830695652585
in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder   221.41166405940513
see gentlemen said m   87.68446163184662
for from this moment you are free as the air   176.92379007880035
oh i have been base cowardly i tell you   109.66753010948881
said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable   19.467215032465518
that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his grace s lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written   68.73667729538944
are you then pressed for this money   109.60222343960511
they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans   186.09103781649577
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide   64.31058125059937
but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me   74.36149825419952
now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail i am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket contained   94.26685384554908
go and take this key with you   46.69100244728058
fine sport   163.70310419777798
on that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or occupation   130.2385739685589
this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible   139.0082126175475
the ghost of samuel appeared to saul and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos   166.1752766323607
but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure   224.38871025412158
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria   168.35489478192773
tomorrow evening at five o clock   6.169759764379933
two angelic faces   104.52648251225018
you will be none the worse off physically or morally   81.24324673935891
aided by the remaining fragment i guessed the rest   31.072681876230334
and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal s people   106.67231719270677
madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m   130.90196824094693
he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out   6.071835500993828
i am glad to be reassured on that point   79.42418448903007
bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness   71.99815839638867
endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers he remained an honest man   104.55653032079583
you can t imagine how much this conversation interests me   208.53265792696797
she has spoken to them   90.14298909002692
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel   72.65567313243855
well your publisher is very generous my dear aramis that s all i can say   196.71603957026664
but that is not all there is a codicil as i said just now   158.66218268274304
absolutely   85.52821156038407
hurry up there you rascal   66.3449651698264
be brave faithful and loyal he said you are brave faithful and loyal   56.73645086933143
oh is this true what you say   59.93444378303044
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping   52.71570535892684
m   71.681988172693
are you aware my lord that mendacity is an organized body a kind of association of those who have nothing against those who have everything   97.38691233302356
by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said monte cristo carelessly   143.2083343001815
certainly not longer   141.8081925623195
it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count   26.269021531349125
no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing   110.47718816762422
if that is the case i warn you i shall have you put in a lunatic asylum   63.03739165622928
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot   221.92531126026842
but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlini s part   88.89774659424845
mazarin opened the coffer   104.94419269184931
an hour and a half   100.46435887519841
it can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts   140.77794698312795
it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met   109.81546773921096
like you i hesitated but the count s eloquence decides me   70.01682393631052
on the contrary be off and quickly   114.77380561173929
he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return   152.06965607503997
ah and a master stroke too i assure you   144.34612339266224
d artagnan saw that the moment was come   170.83194133375474
one step farther into rest two perhaps into silence   129.31252565388573
cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice   118.8181342582927
we are the poor succored by god   123.49198018953673
she is sure of it   61.76134420593116
well said danglars did you see him   95.23791459202994
pray signor pastrini asked franz is not some execution appointed to take place today   87.17157791824097
20261m monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart   136.58864290029345
morrel   45.027919239406316
this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime   189.63028402418934
said the queen   192.87248559495276
mad   109.32005581963938
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence   218.33988993292286
danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests   76.27861768990061
yes saddled and bridled   188.48767067909301
porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large mustache   163.98163966879935
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio   192.0993198132299
athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear   113.3138003629592
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously   109.96191562862718
inquired monte cristo   152.2348988588961
the devil   106.04686968179905
the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his   142.60393606729014
when he had once passed the massive door covered with long square headed nails he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen who crossed one another in their passage calling out quarreling and playing tricks one with another   172.50140646937518
behind the grating of the room into which andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of m   208.33773243504993
ten days passed away thus   89.63182448446248
oh no no i declare it is not   120.64949451683744
there remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain   24.80353945026104
but your mission will not be accomplished   188.76160559246415
his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal   103.47735458749058
what is the use of boring one s self with so many things   148.4814469820409
the day was passed at saint peter s alone   98.16508794170761
i have sometimes thought as you do athos   135.40907391139956
if he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says i will answer for it he will look twice   39.46205313672158
from the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow   151.38811815520558
besides here s the end of the cable   86.43160760743783
at length they arrived at the famous room   198.7988703298783
as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together   170.65734436884551
ridicule sir why you know not its power in france and yet you ought to know it   104.47568743537362
if what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family   182.82853588897245
and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hands   133.6914260606654
his mother   94.0850354144028
as your excellency may have observed your horse is in the great gateway ready saddled for your departure   223.73988968922228
which is the nearest way   93.63057241007107
haste   147.29460312868525
he believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was completed   48.1584812591058
welcome   92.4624930233162
go my dear curate and may god assist you   130.83424413233507
take back those horrible vegetables and that poor kickshaw   35.572789363466796
besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the present   159.09328709952274
but if it is a woman who writes said aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her d artagnan   121.53753606711516
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch   81.27091967497313
de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed   177.3296193848785
before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and bertuccio with terror   197.03765872806565
carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting   53.33235488540509
and yet they were the same murmured monte cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night   45.788519952512345
it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil   163.77342340783383
i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money today   174.65258929755714
he frowned and his cheeks were colored   47.04217325521988
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg™ electronic works   142.10225389193025
eagerly inquired the two youths   149.46923602660436
then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet   74.0121761357932
a stranger who will not send in his name   191.50465369538054
the carnival was over   180.00680900013805
are you ill mother   94.60062133367548
patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france   58.09201984016637
the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room   59.617386926923196
this order to heat the irons made dantès shudder   101.25113310155028
30107m ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained   221.43738597164935
make it monsieur i listen   152.8101676508553
no not me but a young corsican my companion   103.78863236822119
he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so   296.55017119724437
what is that   55.01941864190448
the countess said morcerf was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive   209.10385029505335
porthos is coming he swims like leviathan   121.2695891340721
by this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets   107.25304387204406
the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne   164.33578689116143
what is the matter maximilian   99.4330237360109

beauchamp and château renaud exchanged looks of astonishment   188.49988616481613
the tumult was indescribable   111.43035613337672

the night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted   198.88064018842186
shall you never leave me again   149.12861153159562
the two friends made an appointment for ten o clock on the following day   27.85927790100692
cried planchet i ve a man behind me   11.129155526402215
juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his confession   55.03467962713499
raoul   170.3084516703241
anquetil   148.89683353880815
i should not have guessed it   85.76070672523008
yes and for a most curious one   37.20753657959902
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow   53.539505600653804
willingly said aramis   117.84974916862664
héloïse de villefort   193.78676260781072
what do you want   109.58043498956853
hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth powder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading papers of paris muttering these papers become more and more stupid every day   56.363297655443056
in this way do you see   154.18159258322333
she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul   113.81447039889377
if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood   53.00359144619681
no object affects me   52.13957786710567
a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis   40.046340883749764
d avrigny accosted the priest   120.41903715010119
monsieur d artagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in a hollow tone   134.73290892783848
will she permit it   149.4109603930632
i demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and i will furnish the house with all necessary information   95.63278393803017
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him   147.48478294816744
no but her mother   117.96034377624576
de tréville s clock three quarters of an hour but i thought as it was yet only twenty five minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon you   43.617961978037556
all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter   56.5470854128858
we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract instead of the evening of the wedding that is all   145.72661915807305
the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred flambeaux of white wax a piece of luxury unheard of at that period   186.31895990121478
cried milady struggling   68.00720923579641
there is still time to withdraw   100.4981225186549
and it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared   17.412992817286366
the pardon the next day danglars was again hungry   159.5620926551211
the same period was given to his creditors and the manner in which he intended spending their money   120.62383859473297
this time d artagnan was only in part mistaken   58.09172734057008
art thou happy friend   137.27171480628968
in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more   89.15065817997723
indeed   49.95971634399244
and yesterday evening he came again   93.67415200019911
the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m   55.4149388815513
of course said d artagnan   161.3166203176458
he would have spoken but his voice failed him   231.17357181897222
ah   177.72666164652753
her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his first rate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife   130.582904250134
do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp visit him alone   129.76233408828466
the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow   176.6311955624254
you follow the world my young friend and i tremble lest grace prove not efficacious   124.465830097432
because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road   23.700423918604244
the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man   138.02316005223162
let s sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the night   135.02588394744666
you know i used to be a good cook   150.02201067708887
asked comminges who putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness   106.05759467537678
the major s eyes sparkled brilliantly   42.09639807360179
porthos looked at d artagnan in astonishment   110.24297574787612
you are my friend today   146.00102633189633
what milady   141.66392858260008
yes   150.10166942112164
and this carte blanche said d artagnan this carte blanche does it remain in her hands   186.94466511320869
monsieur d artagnan   125.42473892584528
this day will be a warm one said planchet in a warlike tone   199.83282325295613
ah cowards   101.08001521154651
it seems said d artagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries   96.9829584361805
nay be not discouraged   23.532763953996408
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead   98.95349993826883
said villefort   125.22878897348207
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple   131.01532429148935
how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child   44.37860829719256
capital answered the mendicant   134.1648863709836
and your servants too how very well behaved they are   86.218087109573
then i will add two words about the young greek girl   100.982286705078
certainly sir it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante chamber only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy   13.964357764012732
said the guide and pushing danglars into the cell he closed the door upon him   126.90695728582199
the cemetery of père lachaise m   90.86959943259075
i am sure of it   129.21160681185714
have you finished   86.59610004871334
aramis after a journey into lorraine disappeared all at once and ceased to write to his friends   83.4204023955015
the second followed and descended from the plateau   115.14203511535537
yes returned d artagnan who had overheard him to night gentlemen we rescue the king   13.907203526950283
all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended   95.85459264256565
inform the queen   67.81446894805498
and as the romance of don quixote was then the fashion they said that he was sancho who after having lost one master had found two   82.8033316110638
but the queen was firm   26.47759833992299
oh i also swear it   95.35025277555832
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket   155.67998561195597
and the two englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded   69.26990240743856
certes if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the baron   98.03623254671369
cried olivain   139.13906407494676
should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with   52.36389904930728
surely at the death of mazarin   208.72260573702636
the count was no longer young   93.70913048347907
all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted d artagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for a minute   64.54313877179047
well i must confess it does replied d artagnan   214.16172940850043
the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere   188.25807099732145
the center of the most animated group was a musketeer of great height and haughty countenance dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general attention   81.24722392231396
her position in the count s establishment is not sufficiently understood   10.834995762067862
do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune m   85.44701027951704
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead   80.41810048445197
well   110.02923425818356
why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion   88.18762077760864
to horse porthos   183.04179932488324
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night s adventure i don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one   166.461887018278
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis   123.88972041459577
the whole brought up by fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile   113.49357121462252
the king thanked m   77.03943524204325
do you think you have to do with galley slaves or novices in the world   233.04387048626245
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless   80.11455905822734
cried felton   172.90236659788513
and if lord winter s men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost   129.80846006480357
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence   16.629122557474773
very well it is your own doing   2.446208768945965
i have corrected the vices that i had   100.94521823445436
6 guillotine   118.06682697861585
he then walked slowly towards the allées de meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story   159.42708052185054
and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end   79.25718415701193
twenty paces   206.94075789975574
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned   96.36701737041108
the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life   23.04764779202685
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u   121.41861421725717
that would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar   180.8993666827136
if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality   86.8377067230012
with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home   181.51446969611845
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving d artagnan learned that he exercised from six o clock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine o clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern   127.55092034236392
whence then will come the help we need from chance   65.98840129104448
why how extraordinary   119.96185768948268
the fool   156.75632959008794
i will not repent   37.757408422135825
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide   82.86688322422597
you are very kind but i may be prevented   51.31500398096654
for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercédès smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes   114.79270694998925
the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed   121.48661909427796
supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles i can not see much that is left unless they eat one another   194.81920533790867
now to apply it in your case to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable   99.64771060686843
besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end useless injury is repugnant to every mind   135.85370381346866
you can tell within ten crowns   197.53221465678033
said porthos   127.66541691352054
if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right   161.63585827351082
de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons   93.21295056797086
he is merely my father said albert m   94.63748003651071
i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible mordaunt   93.7380892741588
to repeat these signs   186.5977535040695
around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette   161.476020317841
ha   80.7043890391221
spectre against spectre   80.52631121530355
i know who it is   113.76183821431276
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states   31.21255559999493
these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth   113.67032320962082
certainly there are   64.07353392227148
well you do not reply   146.23093665766572
nothing but bitter recollections   68.55550367123573
if monsieur de tréville heard you you would repent of speaking thus   136.85436101944384
aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody   160.94960381734197
his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion   138.51805225859079
the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed   160.42409131083957
i have replied d artagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table   25.97443432940743
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him   67.03601270373258
he has faith in himself   112.91790349991311
a good idea said d artagnan   182.99305297712903
and setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea   67.00521730383792
of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom brisemont poured the lees into a glass and d artagnan desired him to drink it for the poor devil had not yet recovered his strength   136.61974000254594
monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity   146.4402689192535
in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and d artagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and ante chamber   115.67923905691596
did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours so cruel to me today that you came to england solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for it seasickness tempest captivity   123.78767610924287
faria bent on him his penetrating eye   165.092268620643
no replied mousqueton parry kept it   94.38454796902639
aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the loins   161.27153509848821
i hope you will not complain now   110.22863804766494
said mousqueton the letter was very consoling   139.4759570909204
yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink beer   70.03541341500075
luckily the man i had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so i took advantage of his silence to walk off   92.98296504564597
30   61.13448522715288
then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table   177.91675551815175
it was exquisite sir   75.51852248099902
yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely   165.38308196953616
suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square   191.62747319457768
the tree was easy to climb   145.81904403487448
but it s all my fault   237.86223995398092
bonacieux shrugging her shoulders   155.0258168148781
yes   135.00516161807533
indeed you give me more credit than i deserve   95.56767791878296
he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast   77.51763549981878
franz d épinay   114.25512417133496
but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in m   148.00608027003787
what do you want with us   156.75322171178198
that is better said the gascon   76.81434593956551
nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis   132.96862489615657
and being a musketeer but for a time i only fight when i am forced to do so and always with great repugnance   106.15051145745277
she wore a beaver hat with blue feathers a surtout of gray pearl velvet fastened with diamond clasps and a petticoat of blue satin embroidered with silver   136.2168628347131
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the lackey   9.816013947566006
and then changing the conversation all at once athos said by the by i thank you for the horse you have brought me   52.047394325140814
and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear   209.43154804098444
franz   137.99765513574195
and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it   167.4866296904053
along the isle of dogs   41.01369885576139
adieu then sir and do not forget the prescription   78.85480454084919
during that time he had many moments of despair   173.22270687419424
none of her women accompanied her   92.28913685115455
but the knee of mme   49.235953724198595
but where you go i go   63.44611635685181
bonacieux fell into a profound reflection   49.407395372777344
i was most anxious to see you   109.19498261141436
it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam   79.10424913524729
this advice was to the jailer s taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip   98.83457950114209
in a word said mercédès it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended   114.37448431827602
only think of the poor old man s being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor   121.04608072036707
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep   4.076251526563723
and he caused himself to be announced to the minister   10.369185277510795
fifteen thousand francs do you understand   28.08015700559642
to the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble   64.80249698111453
but go a little way from france go either to aleppo or cairo or only to naples or rome and you will see people passing by you in the streets people erect smiling and fresh colored of whom asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say that man was poisoned three weeks ago   142.42926371172095
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride   57.30405153683841
he can not acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through m   19.31931479678407
come come said maximilian i will serve as your guide   97.59988682164287
impossible   117.8582702659186
dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now   78.48919357139062
we hope so answered the curates   9.288550399529868
yes yes guitant said mazarin   78.63976917451598
when they were within ten paces of him d artagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to them   127.64197757523254
what again   173.80718039319936
nonsense   25.17278391298467
it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes his refusal by winking them several times and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven   94.64580625622384
he saw that it was a merciless war between us a war to the death   182.70150715042305
indeed i should think not replied monte cristo   85.8769881779503

i therefore repeat to you i speak not to a magistrate but to a friend   198.33843444026633
exclaimed albert   131.6198428143143
it was you who took him count said raoul smiling   161.7172907409813
and this is the reason monsieur continued maximilian of my sister and brother in law having only 25 000 francs a year   233.21769834836266
she is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us   196.42417016027616

when i was at rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than benedetto became master and everything went ill   205.9234775203097
so saying the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations   214.15693947525853
she therefore contented herself with saying that m   138.6881652609835
come in my dear john said lord de winter come in and shut the door   253.02498825846288
that is he that is he   125.83501085987164
as happy as it is allowed to one of god s creatures to be on this earth   130.22048255465043
these were the lackeys of these gentlemen   43.83034111701353
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed   150.4118080884832
the monk had disappeared   192.78839126198116

dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them   45.17142913658839
his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four o clock though he never spent the night there   56.46392407438898
i inured my body to the most violent exercises my soul to the bitterest trials   197.5506973778878
which you are taking back to him   160.96069236924836
how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested   35.21859122916784
that s true   86.01443532604681
why she is the old wife of a procurator of the châtelet monsieur named madame coquenard who although she is at least fifty still gives herself jealous airs   182.43731953765874
one might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet   18.659181134245117

porthos made a sign of assent   66.01359127502889
it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters   22.889643085833285

if we had been in their place   27.690732683285546
oh you don t see straight said danglars   86.82168331179234
inquired vampa of the sentinel   160.2325980139284
but she was absorbed by jealousy   160.42466282893528
i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty   18.930820756498477
i do not think that such is his intention said morrel   34.96606299184204

the storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen   126.11918465991099
but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the count de guiche acted as his secretary   106.27421729603539
but then he had the woman he loved still remaining   127.3706568190551
these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list   70.28365364653627
i only wait till you give them   66.86104520882881
in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search   139.03161730551565
i return to my convent   148.9750188324346
the count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation   171.25198379188018
no one but you appeared to be so   69.69397648862432
why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that for a bullet may break a leg and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head   101.61502315549515

i am an officer of fortune nothing else   97.45050216106378

as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place   167.97045280709966
he lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to heaven and recognized friquet   74.4913588772927
d artagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read dec   123.82717839727195
sign it   197.2721345295523
the horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles   173.00313351995436
and who is this witness or rather this enemy   40.51093002689218
if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white   87.96662416758782
yes   229.95729999663516
no time was to be lost   164.90234581111346
yes the priest   127.15550351237138
asked andrea with some uneasiness   119.86469388830467
come now what are your conditions   78.34954364558469
debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive madame danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments   110.17385370595929
i do better than that sir i save you   108.96483315726347
adieu   100.35936727709708
asked the cardinal   115.6022540524625
the lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left   188.5543659930564
alas   140.81312114366315
cried kitty springing forward to meet her mistress   115.80901612275167
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse   66.70332368722045
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered   94.1817402762589
this time franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat   198.00888703850433
take your glass then and let us drink   88.96398362400905
aramis stopped   81.7364347918018
oh no monsieur d artagnan said raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you   207.18677987059073
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise   82.74265728947906
yours is a pretty business   175.30151955283347
but if i were ever to meet him i should recognize him in an instant i will answer for it were he among a thousand persons   167.94069042315877
the man of meung   136.14108587722626
although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others   104.7892069839599
he answered therefore i think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of bragelonne and that gentleman he pointed to aramis had also something to tell me when i was in his convent   143.8255589030711
e   121.0394821823848
ma foi said the jeweller drenched with rain i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight   143.3684777068733
i go sir said mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered   185.24904835882205
debray shrugged his shoulders   85.06998008365622
to tell you the truth i consider it lost   141.05022778534527
they are bad managers said d artagnan shrugging his shoulders   65.56726254559557
i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other   162.4901324500446
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last   88.85725118479331
and remember that two legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others   95.9177014509431
he is awaiting your majesty at cours la reine   187.40134237210688
and they walked on again   165.2258755361342
only i fancied that the honest messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches   260.4879523892027
you seem more than commonly thoughtful   108.4718849213549
i monsieur replied the abbé with an air of surprise i want nothing   108.4037675870298
franz is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told   121.91264135020327
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal 100 000 francs which i spent in four or five months   130.48194596380844
your declaration   30.038211068154624
and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house   146.6373805524691
pardon you monseigneur   92.16303023100883
the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort l evêque   104.04924797737614
half the camp was at the barrier   231.071113716467
he continued so i was going away but he called me back   39.72525040598387
it is all as he has said   92.08161982828423
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch   76.79851696507168
i am lost murmured the queen lost   137.77283649067712
oh it is a proof that the lord is on our side felton replied milady   31.515494616566414
eyes of an admirable expression   155.90931309436397
didn t you hear me tell you monsieur d artagnan that i don t know where he is   88.33694368143381
but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned   211.30867477296272
there is still something else said he   119.21599619046218
d artagnan was the youngest of all these men   102.26918982079135
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke   105.46263076284713
your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and i am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require   107.57230670293112
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa   165.03926574360926
this famous invention of yours   66.02911306705813
in short you will find your father a very presentable person i assure you   109.94562007210999
and why separate   164.75535924195563
i will allow myself to die with hunger   62.67039617435908
a fine name said morrel   225.94150609193386
i have brought you another said d artagnan   135.5292494749769
villefort became livid   109.60607014945911
noirtier   151.56774432050136
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d artagnan who however placed himself between him and them   18.338014040968602
and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the garden walks   256.21228978445004
oh these are fine words   119.77493682690951
here you are home again raoul said the comte   182.84267390298953
oh what an alliance the tiger and the serpent   72.28890019256264
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the cellar   200.75681094108631
but we have not seen him   55.3233071299052
she would have seduced a saint   139.70855286787113
there was no great cunning necessary   223.07752509889502
i should take the hundred pistoles   9.035476873007553
but you are able to have me arrested you are able to have me tortured you are able to have me hanged   56.7217897267664
now mazarin was alone and defenceless as he well knew   181.7058835587875
dessessart captain of the guards as well as the others   210.4921710408432
it was about four o clock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne   44.39627824036987
how   91.73011262707587
at five o clock replied the count   69.85237885744964
but my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return yes if i return   112.64660964414736
the prison register the day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between bellegarde and beaucaire a man of about thirty or two and thirty dressed in a bright blue frock coat nankeen trousers and a white waistcoat having the appearance and accent of an englishman presented himself before the mayor of marseilles   157.01980868099514
the next day must clear up every doubt   107.6576574442521
their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats   32.75147673604417
comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened   211.09785954949155
what   129.9009617739116
it was useless   58.93742555243548
come   141.46573239247303
i do not like to disturb those who pray madame said felton seriously   258.6361551413255
well then he is a bandit compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere children   81.63223280526321
oh   111.47445215833548
that s it   130.08552186509615
the whole   182.77145492367436
supper was served   59.623295771870865
he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe   152.25764768571838
and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that mazarin had poisoned him   208.48573193840983
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place   112.31228370346406
alas do you not know   186.7346486854384
i shall work doctor when i work i forget everything   93.10646749075931
buckingham tried to smile a last time   86.09525361067278
m   132.57330610579368
is she there grimaud   105.03716003404983
i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months i shall be an officer or dead   65.06571427817954
albert rose to return to his place   124.92788425208528
some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost   29.18331054434799
then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant   169.94466692848698
fortune has been kind to you then   93.2709558941082
yes replied aramis i am extremely careful of my appearance   104.81464325651562
i am the viscount de bragelonne and he is called grimaud   152.73677467931293
asked louise   57.631706527687996
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky   63.484861040381205
although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other   34.872894905043424
i knew that said monte cristo   53.452501548318395
you know that he has another name besides monte cristo   60.172076102895744
at the royal arms of england you will find a young gentleman named mordaunt   174.75568970087195
of what else should i speak   56.523800041270555
this house in past years did ours a great service and has i know not for what reason always denied having rendered us this service   199.1230922036074
alas   245.37306961042106
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately   180.57337820855804
what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me   197.09562528718334
i will follow you   69.41600118107746
at last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door   166.04701275664678
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose   57.756206208261204
today the old noirtier or young valentine   110.23065501771163
i like dantès   102.3476294495911
to arms   147.17758738249947
you may not only hope said danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part   134.20149116098477
we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes and we shall have complete success   146.58389069396745
sixteen pioneers four soldiers   219.60994672778475
no   136.6927864935963
you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing the usurper has landed at cannes with several men   129.8719056513942
edmond replied who knows   128.19501173457758
in that case his last hope would have been destroyed   94.38811655303297
but first give me this letter   34.281160474172566
exactly so   174.56534577149614
it was a lieutenant s commission in the musketeers   42.613595356519824
he resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance   62.68719914116351
you are a woman of precaution i see my dear madame coquenard said porthos squeezing the hand of the procurator s wife tenderly   45.2034996202631
i say that she is a hostage for the parisians answered the cardinal   26.57198766231278
he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage   90.28932757215502
you had never anything to complain of   174.01355343047803
said he to the sailors   154.5873113665687
they were very happy   136.71785130823136
what then   63.214071535458544
i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years   64.10406108925986
they never buried the dead   118.93775086599676
monte cristo then was in league with his father s enemies   150.13474306896546
federal laws and your state s laws   120.45169748279795
but that is not the question   115.59226745152613
count to possess valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me   95.89536486227883
cried villefort then i was not deceived   87.74958076443941
thank you   154.31199291697192
well can i see porthos   133.74380095538464
until to morrow evening you are not at your own disposal   193.84055469604525
a noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block   198.17128948814005
you must do so   160.05037471459613

wait it ought to be there in my pocket   82.02550021888995

dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing a grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury   129.07700843301845
well then cried d artagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls   30.442680487729916
if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it   22.200724703884646
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum   41.595081896083514
he seemed scarcely five and thirty   283.2239704520468
and who thus designated it   51.096136172808826
to reach england athos lowered his voice all france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed   247.79166783645354
oh yes she cried i do love you   133.601442917361
our duty is fulfilled   152.50453786166025
and he let his head sink upon his hands while two large tears rolled down his cheeks   84.84931571419173
i was without a light in that room   213.3307786192206

adieu my lord   157.2369699787145

franz took them from barrois and casting a glance at the cover read to be given after my death to general durand who shall bequeath the packet to his son with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document   5.028400433059332

and you have seen him   152.67965819647117
edward said villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawing room my dear   91.53263328121471
you see in me such as i am a person sentenced to be hung   3.469345172344873
from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught   186.8859960653515
well my dear mouston he said rest satisfied   124.5297861268946
the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner   200.2996870812513
so i am of these men   27.324440635097332
the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès residing in the allées de meilhan and also a young woman called mercédès an inhabitant of the catalan village   60.09270162674488
d artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded   136.75842665486712
morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed   18.561561312307134
the corvette must now i think be on her way to fécamp must she not   147.25874921201856
yes answered monte cristo happily yes conscience does remain   162.8469313794705
you believed that you would fly from me by returning to paris   130.30677339853514
you are right   208.88706495689715
de tréville   156.4119922241032
he turned his head looked around him and saw no one   262.57175985265906
we will escape and if we can not escape we will talk   155.64054810319809
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of d artagnan and athos   139.73594569563474
oh madame said villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts   52.30465868880957
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone   44.91155453006429
four   43.58282967896018
asked dantès of himself   123.78564371091196
this was divided into three compartments one which was covered by the floor of that room in which athos porthos and aramis were to pass the night   105.96852290366084
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence   111.11049217104339
and i said tréville coldly i have some pretty things to tell your majesty concerning these gownsmen   99.6259014144493
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m   71.91128187505218
on your honor is that true   87.14995936781025
but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury   123.53818564889161
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one   204.30342409773158
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hated he was only not precisely loved   78.02319910010311
do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste   60.92480347195156
to maintain a cause which i believed sacred i have lost the throne and my children their inheritance   181.79335602060686
tell me sir could you have the courage to do so   94.42829616284027
what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion   101.36825204517001
i have promised you the truth   52.233138633533784
if we stay here five minutes more there s an end of us   33.23927756200702
d artagnan came the next day to milady s and finding her in a very ill humor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m   34.81877050612103
and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when i marry   131.76008247082646
the valet de chambre appeared on the door steps   168.9428346183023
it appeared as if there were abysses in milady s soul whose depths were dark and unknown   137.35036681238188
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival   169.23021624571285
la ramee some day when he sends for you you must let me put on your clothes   142.47930449973555
danglars said monte cristo   83.68064008836834
on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady and bound her hands and feet   75.13254261581784
have you kept him in the cellar all this time   58.177486589682665
well what are you doing count to a former lackey   112.03329518082461
i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless   10.940961529459045
that is all very simple you had business in england   82.55704679281277
really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said monte cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction   139.40695415927965
morrel   211.57369269755196
demanded milady with a certain terror   125.0693815146231
morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing noirtier upstairs   65.5421539054238
then when i shall have learned what i desire to know i will withdraw   83.05889039547174
no you do not know me   76.69047177013051
what name did you pronounce then madame de morcerf   113.95179982855481
and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon   80.02857185090346
precisely   127.20149551867335
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price   243.71769757929428
well i will tell you   186.80395516437403
you may join me at the hôtel des gardes   168.67883626374942
i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea   15.737157381958951
asked aramis in the same language   4.617649888336544
only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror   125.48819707087512
mazarin is almost king answered athos   145.22262206404707
without this letter i should not have heard till to morrow perhaps after to morrow the last of all paris   129.6194262502674
grimaud s first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour s riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe   182.52557744290192
do you remember sir it was my idea the scotch treaty for giving up the king   225.28274455369746
but what detains her   60.58310028793486
and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter   128.48277975951618
egad i know where he is said d artagnan   113.96639668386145
i supplicate you i implore you on my knees let me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver   81.18365985013017
the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and retired   172.9569652940123
the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed   130.67010039920402
when he had mounted his phaeton monte cristo turned and seeing bertuccio what news   28.08590149353097
de tréville alone remaining with the wounded   104.25854478131662
these words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness   0.8926690302016169
she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling   137.46256792191892
at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared   100.34106167799845
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation   60.0851102541357
la jeune amélie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica   82.85520790660736
today i am at your service replied the count   135.0310987197838
at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m   137.64850981956167
that is precisely what i mean said danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man   31.34808670600532
my son said the king to aramis do not take it so to heart   76.19672074180932
and i renew my promise   117.29637804790963
your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself   36.466685247040985
said blaisois   111.33781139899165
at the same time the count appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black hair was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel   95.69729021162348
the cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of m   69.33039614124621
was he young or old   121.7330913743614
what need you fear   83.57042892127899
and a minister   142.7344922363866
besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking besides who says that it will begin again   141.37316201951876
he was armed at all points   71.51359913444091
to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the papal states who earned a pittance by diving into the tiber at high water from the bridge of st   174.65141845179724
danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife s favorite sitting room where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself   148.0314652873616
i am king of all creation   123.28173271609643
the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him   90.79657203767295
that may be my lord   113.79448723573437
he only changed his sword hand and fought with his left hand   86.99951665837739
it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail   104.56739587282908
the bastion saint gervais chapter xlvii   105.24452566227421
then he slowly uttered these words who is now dying in your house   79.99162162881578
yes replied the procureur   113.76931799027447
said the queen   121.7711383382752
very good   218.56899732334375
oh my god   44.13664671614495
two monseigneur   131.12116338721094
sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess   62.779602626251084
but i recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep i wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to me   182.24302405511946
cried anne of austria   195.83117496480799
and what do you know about them monsieur   170.673314784046
advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight   90.09347882894079
on the contrary be seated   106.75393433057236
the count does not know   64.47565168775387
will that do   145.92376376285708
the queen bent in token of submission and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room   100.22994824495483
speak on   119.78841701959932
you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life   68.09413512756373
you may copy it give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www   54.0243122078131
and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges10 or desdemona   139.06031713392164
noirtier s eye bade her stop   97.7452423730231
and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher   65.59245849795573
by the faith of a gentleman   239.02632724801953
villefort bowed   205.4281722645386
but d artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall   79.40809251568007
madame de longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty   64.83119816487226
said the cardinal quickly   123.4201615522961
then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject   127.5719295855718
40188m florentin here   156.37272503906127
m   46.96185010008983
say no more about it   194.63824289257656
and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat   41.441555950971775
franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfred s shoulders or beneath lara s helmet   225.85076697697025
a few minutes after twelve o clock bernouin knocked at the queen s bedroom door having come by the cardinal s secret corridor   81.08114490390625
therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death   16.93355569117483
to night we stop at derby   91.45017325328317
yes   43.178321438458354
exclaimed d artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us   100.76303933424106
de boville   296.075448363571
the other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman   111.07978691106
but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence   130.0756873027296
no merely his testamentary executor   202.26093186183928
then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought   67.85420598387441
there s vulcan foundered   71.78044991760174
and with whom   120.79686192714816
tranquil yes replied cromwell   52.96048622549996
you have saved my life and i thank you continued dantès   220.97875342188613
he sleeps indeed   92.76748825471427
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an auberge recommended by a sign representing st   118.69334995633778
very brave said monte cristo   122.0156270808346
what are the two fish   174.4765546905176
well what matters all that to us   156.62301795463313
i m certain of it   128.41384532953646
yes   69.19024196935521
in a pate   98.00154195830964
my head feels actually cold said porthos   61.25088244179169
ah to be sure i have not answered you   171.00169562095175
it would be rendering a service to her future son in law   193.41231638247103
and whilst d artagnan uttered a cry porthos raised the oar and aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea   121.135893213011
the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf   103.7888355461081
cavalcanti continued danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million livres   107.82381826058543
in the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinal s will   99.89020250626034
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his son s warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother   150.71179552145452
chapter xxi   194.38613586339915
for in truth he only drank to combat this sadness which wine however as we have said rendered still darker   118.07219097539623
that is the least we owe her   101.3416981030558
repeated a third voice   112.42066923254953
yes my good friend this worthy porthos has just received a sword wound and i am taking him to his country house at saint cloud   128.27248000682604
but on my soul it looks so   43.96532901524459
but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which spada had written i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle   94.99443236283648
still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of blood   85.19555756157679
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him   113.7262697008903
alas   197.65856050972604
rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said morcerf somewhat piqued   87.43834879752602
now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed   87.3763153750481
hein   117.73534216066538
and added he biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread i have formed a plan   133.8964207377822
for me i well know my sweet girl said d artagnan   24.92144460277936
he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions   87.21437977365534
if she seduced your brother you said she seduced him did you not   114.3710162523716
mouston appeared with a most piteous face   96.07005516278491
where he fell   112.414871780199
the rochellais then had no hope but in buckingham   178.25927906364413
how sirrah   100.51064487536219
that one   163.38284090887967
come i will reform   58.07966711316583
said she   95.29361929984296
the other was an instrument that was all   100.92325858669108
i am indeed to be pitied   137.60137592521704
as enceladus   124.30169308483781
and remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world   56.34053353039053
i recollect now said the officer in a jeering tone   140.86187287206067
listen   176.36569701396232
not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire   232.11149047459048
let them come in   54.886648903421786
yes yes that is he   126.70056913792455
these words gave great joy to d artagnan   113.04785702610965
and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year 1829 your excellency   127.42255960802252
meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder   124.12275724084613
and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friend s valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five   153.85882453059014
an affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in paris   145.689442650385
are you an angel   130.363324297015
the ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen entrées   192.81809097351248
by the way said the major you know i have only the 2 000 francs which the abbé busoni sent me   208.5971655186058
uncertainty is worse than all   120.53342463488774
devil of a man corsican that you are always mysteries or superstitions   133.15570697524984
doubtless answer me   174.6529751006439
114 frs   109.55478134180873
ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta   68.46041001446369
my name is edmond dantès replied the young man calmly   162.17658058246317
it is a real bed   136.96074114703066
how and why   169.4460117710586
no but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks   125.35557168786048
if they do not bring life we will give them death   74.16299081627895
peste   159.7786076061241
it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live well   7.222846362138952
silence   226.3632483965669
the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for   163.56918889945396
i was far from france at that period   138.17235236097628
asked villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of morrel   71.17203892966691
still ali thanks to his wild nature and the count thanks doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees   48.690070103481744
the stranger met julie on the stairs   144.7472322323014
she was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea   55.1052465108008
i wish to see the governor   116.67325108344168
gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have places at my windows   87.57935559222554
do you know this gentleman   135.76489437871635
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little   110.60980974036333
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near   164.12645485322577
i am sorry to say i must do so madame i only came to remind you of your promise for saturday   160.6637209821243
he had scarcely been a week at leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins contraband cottons english powder and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark   133.5128377204333
oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur d artagnan is right   139.29636550265639
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me   104.84093022927763
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that   141.50606629571539
de tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly   176.75686489063733
his house   141.51746925812478
and that is a great deal it seems to me   163.16296556216423
and i sign my orders said mazarin taking a piece of paper and writing some lines   85.26655691148733
d artagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort   158.31237744499015
i have the price   81.28661829992191
he had borne with the public prison and with privations of all sorts   3.1135119039776242
but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it   151.63219409921143
and he struck out with the energy of despair   81.94504574800655
the rain of blood chapter 46   74.48508427042046
murmured d artagnan crumpling his note   171.07131636995848
but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it   44.32320368838673
d avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death   209.87525405502828
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell   128.28434057526277
for if my lord should be overtaken and caught there s every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to be hung   184.4397990023773
everything relating to this young man is true   206.53135851012001
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word   193.91216296639698
but i make war in my own way   213.5027947133394
in heaven s name   227.66988641778363
d artagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great delusion   148.66406594080368
cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen   154.90028586263807
i have a post by which i live   47.576068089552805
well go and fetch them and come to my apartment   135.7219642664357
cried my father   150.18290007415806
hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal   180.48881591240269
wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed albert stepped back and morrel closed the door   53.128315581651464
you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn   41.65306589465858
i have a slave   120.070108481066
no said jacopo   239.2046140552543
cried the jesuit   14.45959455810842
20219m let us understand each other said albert   257.55404483150755
i did not sleep well   161.4545637308548
no monsieur returned the count   201.6826158354822
quite sir   78.3303200965471
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart   61.45585886265108
nobody will think of us and for my part i am greatly fatigued   177.10813797280332
adieu   103.24486529802837
if he persists his eminence made a pause and resumed if he persists well then i shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states   75.66620995751104
answer   128.60302613183046
the deliberations had already begun   62.58987214185913
it was they   82.06271871960655
i know you are not rich madame coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them   218.07323235272153
give me another cutlet   136.2775720238249
20175m without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count   38.81865858816546
it was one of the gascon s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty   180.1170371396518
why did you not hear all we said   17.903561006077183
and turning towards the young man said well catalan can t you make up your mind   37.11023469690605
good   110.14342131223265
good   122.02024375328901
he turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and resigned   263.895086502136
first m   174.84885920488844
for seeing that i hate drinking by myself you shall drink with me   49.39173770414955
strong thinkest thou   135.18282698243019
and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation   98.69437748160362
you a frondeur   155.8171407799462
well don t budge then   92.0499578771403
de tréville   100.01177961641194
added caderousse with his hoarse laugh   28.297167267574963
then let me offer one more word of advice   166.83609049638295
oh heavens   120.53673384348856
you know well that we go to breakfast there   155.3618725712968
well wife replied caderousse i don t know but what you re right   111.3369464530687
i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service   139.50697586383137
i feel some need of it   134.76411622644488
three days passed seventy two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes   111.86877514989729
the fusillade continued   103.40886539999
the two young persons exchanged looks   86.42267692717942
then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject porthos called the host and asked for dice   152.56773219432048
how can that be   125.3205542848827
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos   157.86823475943024
i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero   211.20565752553307
his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them   134.2963214140728
you are much pleased with yourself said he to raoul when they were alone are you not   127.94388893390237
e   55.4606975632464
i am a brute   188.58572051342327
men are so made   131.71917850011098
only remember this if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear for you will look and you will listen i am quite sure however we may threaten you you are lost   64.08756933788695
but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her   128.5891075142473
a little said mazarin trembling lest anne should ask to draw upon his purse   1.56465016959325
i recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor barrois as well as in that of madame de saint méran   195.67586475469807
but continued aramis the details escape me   139.66098170834425
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price   217.58725600409855
my wife escaped   88.5045197460407
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne   209.21005655805857
those in whom the king has confided lord leven s highlanders   79.2424110434262
said albert   123.79886691101888
oh   90.80835444596045
that is my name said athos quietly   4.214212764670691
you have given me all you can give me and from to day your debt is paid   234.36815803966704
i shall return to the catalans   55.4795520503204
monsieur continued dantès i know it is not in your power to release me   149.5365196894835
they are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of   25.094716090852557
you will not touch the garden either   129.93245934563117
danger my lord   168.36182794660385
i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth   179.29819273973516
athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman   124.34010135235228
alas alas   129.2634020425319
tomorrow perchance it will be our turn   16.2801585772622
the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date   87.20774691767178
besides the letter from mr   201.80527313186096
you are not afraid of ghosts with me i hope   143.5955114110346
yes he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort   52.69219086230949
was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality   146.95147784096926
the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day   141.32498020058694
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it   156.61243750738217
my lord   141.55160133854693
then turning to the queen we may still hope   81.66940935308509
he is right thought athos   183.30273432088268
the steward s emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village   75.26718790237291
they can gain battles   10.02279259055112
ah   45.61582829941152
do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said d artagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead   85.15194802558304
but i can not accept it edmond my son would not permit it   37.482529347898094
she thought that lord de winter had hastened her departure   96.14513982607836
oh never fear   124.76272236616184
the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing   49.93407639246294
the body forgets sometimes   90.66102344823248
luigi vampa s bill of fare we awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by danglars   76.24236160761617
i will take you to my sister who is worthy also to be yours   197.02470702264083
the duke saluted and retired   105.92751075398866
i replied the viscount i saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern   122.08476521276333
muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment   83.82961400205302
and what shall you do   34.089556893916665
not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or i will hamstring your horses   226.528308590546
before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself   63.248888078784816
and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour s grace   138.1929982348892
it is horrible indeed but no one assassinates   92.35412690113361
jean in front of the silver buffet of the city which was guarded by four archers   98.60242849643186
whom do you bring   105.1389808573124
but suggested d artagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so well at chantilly porthos   184.75026736533457
and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony   113.35108442309784
it was worn by my father a loyal gentleman   36.80457439693669
i have already got up again after three stabs from you i shall never rise after this fourth   108.55504391660912
the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu   94.2675661919863
as our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them   210.01622522310345
do you bring me tidings of my guardian   13.094420019036278
said the officer who covered a part of his face with his cloak   139.5634562996268
and that father is well caderousse it is monte cristo   142.6096965433444
there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flower beds   55.3716155418835
arriving unexpectedly in sight of the isle of ré with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men he had surprised the comte de toiras who commanded for the king in the isle and he had after a bloody conflict effected his landing   183.8517724744295
uncle and nephew   132.10949581333472
while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue   289.6615402649725
de villefort said louis xviii   148.26076121740607
i   83.32384264180513
the viscount de bragelonne   102.42036033496898
this place if monsieur d herblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer   81.30242818758859
caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow   66.40897240643855
and the royal father of the princess isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle   139.36833095952332
you will give your name to the captain who will bring you to me   127.24935998845002
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set   73.4479794468392
so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m   1.0005195150105664
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for olivain   189.1224494908415
each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments   34.235812486077805
a bottle perhaps   61.26748575090284
then in my turn i also say very well   85.51736704700707
he met villefort on his way to noirtier s room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept   198.5988856958609
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail coach   194.04851129221234
he stammered edward   135.66442825437906
if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them   155.67101214497933
the voice of the king was tremulous with anger   100.1891924199665
the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture   48.333820301092345
you said that porthos had received a sword cut   111.85985939821757
m   1.7524684493531595
but has he any enemies   99.44604381735732
villefort himself was obliged to open to them   9.039946087718391
monte cristo drew out his watch   233.66738483297664
let me have some dinner   130.671165366873
and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier   208.19337449514086
monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator s wife and not to say a word of the wound   120.2783773859827
undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athos s compliment   135.2477517023582
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons   124.8409823318899
take my advice and set out this evening   114.57470575881214
de villefort s carriage   189.39129461313865
do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us   14.946453565101578
come to me   104.49186619107338
so saying haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act   99.55317063267694
the cries which the police officer repeated twenty times in the king s name were powerless against this formidable multitude seemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more   97.06248824311159
of course   68.48722961849074
the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for   128.63030483798656
yes   44.82124153126756
for a thousand pistoles said the captain   33.92729727934052
poor creatures   145.1448525502115
i can still do much for you   86.57138548448434
who the beggar was that i killed   119.35630526264309
so said the cardinal in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his words you have constituted yourselves judges without remembering that they who punish without license to punish are assassins   142.581585799493
franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion   128.7790897980239
she found milady with a smiling countenance   113.98726721404806
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself   97.17905560025531
she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head   213.36696686254413
the prince read as he hastened on   121.25227930472644
d artagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally   110.67237630117404
worthy wife of such as i am   104.84278524765719
i am captain dantès a loyal frenchman thought accused of treason   239.43818173932334
that letter is not lost   122.93166595446772
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another   162.23473039027158
these words redoubled the eagerness of d artagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace   9.968266950155908
athos placed his two hands on d artagnan s shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad smile   166.9583997727027
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness   92.39979839860385
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood   16.556211070578
so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hour s time he stopped before a little isolated house   134.99778074920857
he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed   11.313679578307017
all at once he raised his head   136.1435318440274
stuart bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make   97.18010982306537
yes sir a rope ladder and tools   22.320670177651337
the agamemnon of aeschylus is based on this legend   168.65622343456874
but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years cocles did not recognize the count   67.45275294047539
listen d artagnan   48.099565997508904
they threw themselves upon me   90.4408763780831
cried the prince   122.56239487105518
the musketeers advanced bowing d artagnan following closely behind them   104.190557090313
five minutes after m   159.1253522656435
it is a charming place well supplied with spring water and fine trees   74.44156049664332
yes count returned the notary   143.27363714483806
but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit   171.0712007929126
said athos speaking in a low voice   169.34410039951914
everyone must live   135.81256180819398
de tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see him   213.686129160997
m   178.76047926819163
he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried   48.39674390889053
now we discover our error   129.62217897329413
the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner   117.32821770575664
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action   90.12059371042467
it was left on board   54.12710546194869
villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to morrel are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur   146.401690697508
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie   165.42180650332023
i know nothing surely monsieur but i suspect someone   157.33467490135786
and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him   82.80493579322605
he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the count of monte cristo   181.91678365462687
or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth right   10.740239854965623
the cardinal as his majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the king s gaming table   156.73157100817997
i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you   73.03317712390017
she perceived felton who sat with his back toward her   97.6895954554072
the bastion saint gervais on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends d artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber   171.52458483751133
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham   141.43633249945637
and it was the sight of his odious blood flowing beneath the ax of the headsman which spread that charming smile upon her lips   130.21319485713232
well do you know why they die so multitudinously at m   215.5675538273107
what are you saying   108.67843111069033
the drum beats   36.02773213286942
athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself   137.34543177075892
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead   109.82441293063651
that young woman whom the queen took out of prison   85.08915984449807
mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing   103.06209551965583
ah it is m   105.13823539014723
what aramis says is very sensible replied athos   133.93629455989515
i was there   147.55919735557256
de tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning   210.7112441678749
i shall call you presently   106.99604844381629
well   159.95440051529874
so continued franz the hero of this history is only two and twenty   71.80975329462004
let us go directly   115.94368306891604
the sergeant put the lantern near the panel   170.93911381537657
still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart   77.75388838778798
barrois muttered a few unintelligible words   92.45424270324199
a man of from thirty five to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the eastern style   54.77210471924021
if he could have made any use of me he would have taken me with him   192.5368692697225
20214m gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you   68.84791158688715
we expect it   142.62127411737438
and then having found nothing returned   139.64031425333002
holà mousqueton seats and order double the bottles   90.24476740082332
all england is with cromwell   210.81466847759305
did you not say so just now   124.86473437004885
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men   131.68255872975064
near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing   84.24506836125298
the abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same   117.47137446287438
as i am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed i went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it   155.35507254685427
porthos murmured d artagnan look well at that priest   26.7375409371991
you have dukes for friends a marshal of france for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens   45.920292565717176
demanded the host   0.5526600440782659
yes to night   173.00146119329003
his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket   22.984469920062665
soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos d artagnan became hourly more in love with milady   154.3973013335886
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eugénie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars   35.58394231252723
albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets   238.35285440409973
they killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summer house overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library   130.94655226950056
but he rid himself of all his spanish shares   38.6644306024822
so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat pocket but at his button hole   64.37983045642073
but are you not still in the service you d artagnan   59.53476236170499
i mean that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me   67.85866082523694
a year after madame   57.90288075209516
felton barred his passage   131.30382867094792
cavalcanti s father will be gone   73.23145925496611
the evening was no longer joy but delirium   132.2310136588172
and you wish to announce the good news to me   92.80400797785255
two hours and a quarter my officer   93.11542542957005
and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied monte cristo bowing   86.42421923339842
let us see what this letter contains   100.78146629420853
cried the duke   174.12949969704306
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless   164.26042258951034
why did we not destroy the child with the mother   87.62367851728452
brave as they appeared to be the two english gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly   88.18450456251415
the baron was to sign first then the representative of m   64.80871868817258
turn chartreux or trappist and relate your secrets but as for me i do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms and i do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening   57.02658443508179
but we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it   162.19781856515536
no   94.77537254872094
true said m   67.1257265342232
but after he had gone about two hundred steps d artagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle   210.13169708329937
so much the worse for you since i shall be obliged to kill you   191.59302281700363
the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abbé busoni who looked cold and calm as usual   76.73822379413005
now you have done grimaud take our brigadier s half pike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king   21.10082877451913
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview   17.204815190332823
the effect of the present revelation was stunning   73.77351630188315
the young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction   165.2064601341635
that s no affair of mine replied the englishman that is the affair of the house of thomson french in whose name i act   132.82311580986044
and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine   78.92263018059984
no count i hope i assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort   238.8559080503381
but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or fortune   17.796342213970547
and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence   142.50442458618176
i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune   89.63100913760219
where does your highness wish to go   130.53887412166557
but quick as it was it did not escape d artagnan s observation   62.33787936711976
don t alarm yourself my little benedetto but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance and i will contrive it   309.8629233048246
for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun   112.61187081401447
no   77.95165620115705
you are young   163.33187676411558
she cried wringing her beautiful hands what   29.540104869135007
yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone another upon the highway or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest aves cœli comederunt illam   96.73609912928654
like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal gift she brought misfortune upon everything she touched   203.59506958286337
ah pardieu   104.47683745059337
but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied dantès and i hope he fully understood it   83.76514824449421
the felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing waves   158.6018666156191
yes sir answered mousqueton   94.62474035487708
he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came   249.91236081188273
now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived   124.22425438987922
let us hope my child cried the marquis that m   108.59924560273372
this modern place of entertainment stood on the left hand side of the post road and backed upon the rhône   159.89036913931352
and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child   245.61915713869394
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion   208.83133196996943
it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o clock this evening   123.75106794355729
she was free now to give way to her transports without being observed   31.76715146858011
few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate   123.26100466992679
asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder   193.2621083535142
luigi vampa comes to take us and we take him we bring him back to rome and present him to his holiness the pope who asks how he can repay so great a service   112.31741736298143
now then all is agreed   52.6229754793916
and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness   26.97008150628767
do you call him nebuchadnezzar   170.9472603791985
let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by to morrow we shall have quite a powerful army   71.24325176663558
and you killed her   112.97284235333925
a galley slave escaped from confinement at toulon   126.87874896292351
he had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at the queen s disposal   250.11807029178692
they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but athos replied in excellent english that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague monsieur bridge the approach of the king   81.83511456278279
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw lots   117.83821949455839
i promise you   83.21142959811456
i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it   165.8045775900925
yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father   214.50540620083953
but all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hôtel   113.20585757077369
i thought that we were finally quit of monsieur de beaufort   173.0771300222768
this short interval was sufficient to determine d artagnan on the part he was to take   120.00848209500494
not badly by any means said the young man   160.06622895341033
but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her   0.0733811494408485
but it appears that is not possible   168.04085893826544
i am determined to tell them all about it   50.24936202454552
but someone else will not be so easy as i am or content himself with the same story   230.5483589613554
they were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty we will see what we can do   102.59218874964756
and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess   93.22223565733825
and can not women be dishonored by appearances   138.0190025783644
with this cloak you will not be cold   101.7535987986054
stay where you are   159.05652023569286
would god send the same dreams to you as to me if you did not love me   72.80509945221166
the old man remained motionless   129.02068740256277
do you fancy because you have heard monsieur de tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us   187.36604891298117
unfortunately it is a thing that i can t perform at any time i choose   251.75255536203457
cedant arma togæ said villefort with a bow   68.57007723860927
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house   13.951865252363604
i warn you master caderousse that you are mistaken   55.003372217081015
chapter xxvi   173.5482402461687
no monsieur   46.295804840589426
at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her   107.67137787141523
they have abducted her added the commissary   29.31195910805951
haitians are the écarté of french stock jobbing   117.00219249383169
this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours   146.52698684268302
bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of d artagnan   165.69269678244996
she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men   162.85562693103552

no you have not   122.47792706972317
i see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper   45.492524570334496
that is the way in which these things are to be accounted for   7.506750254839417
i have not that honor   74.26383988524157
have they spared me   175.7818740742638
a plain and simple beggar as i have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water   103.47939022501016
franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht   103.1920674293501
really said albert i do not know   49.176070287906725
franz stopped   87.40171298158523
yes   70.13168127520223
it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before you   181.85576143931627
coquenard had since the arrival of porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk   69.21488003020795
connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly   169.688507531275
should you not have known me again in spite of my eight and forty years of age   64.18752641939378
i ask for mme   26.962496794451994
all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty   133.4634133614221
the marquis took his arm and they left the salon   125.40077651914984
don t be downcast   80.20278013880775
morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol   65.4871341786654
it is understood is it not   102.74253081797369
of all his friends athos was the eldest and the least resembling him in appearance in his tastes and sympathies   83.88993038231064
he has plenty and to spare for supper   100.41590069696706
de monte cristo   131.12438975737734
well said the count you do not get out m   125.32559046700301
said d artagnan pressing athos s hand   234.01129462235392
now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ball that which contained the letter   10.646277264045722
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors   30.696993998643904
that will be the most sincere line of conduct said mazarin   92.87596528705144
i monseigneur   66.03572086907928
said athos   61.48903199259808

what the devil did you come to such a country for athos   136.72713827439037
i think so answered albert in a firm tone   104.3603458003003
the superior met her   261.0011190064366
for as i am in great haste likewise i wish to beg you to render me a service   146.90920137778454
and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here   128.62309209774332
her ladies that is to say madame de bregy mademoiselle de beaumont madame de motteville and socratine her sister so called on account of her sense had just brought into her dressing room the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped   178.07988940176548
the boy undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour   113.63370977920503
milady was all attention   33.39810407660097
the count is an affable man   118.6637043826279
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done d artagnan   146.6653411375146
i do wish to ask your advice said madame danglars with anxious expectation   120.86761393238953
yes but monsieur de chavigny is sometimes absent   142.2058620942659
of whom i bought her said monte cristo as i told you albert with the emerald which formed a match to the one i had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills   125.19737473293999
you would rather be killed than desert your post   131.17785940777006
chatillon and flamarens looked at each other   7.097835034147295
fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised   61.666771683105104
but this is droll cried d artagnan consoled and holding his sides with laughter   213.39864594530428
what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying you   72.0036604955504
two o clock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour   148.4008596938098
it must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of paris   73.45090654046412
i hope said d artagnan half dead with fright you made no mention of my diamond   142.81221520883363
you see said dantès quitting the helm i shall be of some use to you at least during the voyage   172.478614410607
your name that i may mention it to the queen   191.56680310621192
my body alone suffers as you may suppose   141.48389186160617
the story of ganymede maximilian is not a fable but an allegory   13.490778095627078
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are   129.2872625529442
but i must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred livres   240.14324979473764
and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel   205.52684877504026
do as you like with them   79.08375188633663
it is that then replied the young man anxious to find out the truth it is that then i remember as we remember a dream   127.30402333881946
we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity   234.30163410519802
really my dear gérard you are but a child   107.12364473526685
m   33.184786272146354
a moment said d artagnan   120.92452492769023
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us   133.05227442925207
i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry the father of his gracious majesty   132.41714547865638
at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle   137.06277965629323
this secret aramis does not belong to us   262.55766679593455
rita lay between them   73.01167226846218
the officer entered   135.43881427267218
monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect   93.3114229077721
that s all right edmond   18.2989038351308
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event poor girl so young so rich so beautiful   30.73902344906172
just what you please   66.21713600132392
the young girl did not speak   96.17057134780421
we have parted company this long time   37.71748774222286
cried the young woman in a manner so serious as to make d artagnan start in spite of himself   197.23899144212533
and to whom   14.4802774004648
the latter retained the count s hand between his   3.596941181986068
in fact at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared   101.43393785787877
this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find d artagnan   118.12980267848846
how much   196.47735631235537
yes i can easily comprehend that   135.8039618175179
four days replied his friend are necessary to reach blois   15.744818659193086
you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan with chagrin   100.31309910176239
although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity   75.36781850151357
and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen   143.80863976206922
they may not be so very great   147.53957096707896
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her d artagnan would have returned home since he had so promised   128.9061137582567
he introduces himself to madame danglars it is that he may give her a royal present   169.12487110349787
there i will indicate to you the best place and time   77.92752285930158
i have particular business to settle with this gentleman and i shall and will begin   113.58245454711667
and then said monte cristo this is not all   303.5733892772324
de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family   46.08021759932603
and that is the only reply you make   92.43360127224685

yes   192.2790805883538
the devil take the madman   67.9038347397564
as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going up   90.08866971741675
denis   181.12040508277846
but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moment s repose   100.83734492201154
the countess shuddered   3.9220114270110287
franz likes all that is eccentric   92.7415690194355
meanwhile do you know where the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham are now concealed   71.14682963970358
at last one day emmanuel came to his wife who had just finished making up the accounts   175.52374835627037
yes your excellency   52.457405500738574
it was only on the following day at about ten o clock in the morning as he was starting to call on m   58.868627504713324
a physician a physician m   209.8391786985897
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible   90.30028697845576
at this sigh felton turned round   98.70323954147693
and as the pharaon arrived today why you understand   139.74990723890997
you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended   87.7448166035424
the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the banker s house   41.48467839919863
the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple   194.8609459335588
his acquaintances say he died of grief   73.81280210112658
after the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires   118.69473748693419
he must have been prevented by monsieur de tréville or monsieur dessessart   108.53969149170449
if your man is mine with one blow i shall obtain two revenges that s all   154.1950117485133
beauchamp turned to look at some paintings   115.89809609911246
yes you are right d artagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us   35.32148763265563
as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are   157.22430392402055
do you grasp that   93.68507934439111
it is well madame i believe your oath   172.74878844892112
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father   177.92986394990618
fire fire   37.981850641983556
we will go and see said the doctor   96.3461560998676
bonacieux in her power   118.55190620948528
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live   164.91121436435648
i   8.269707023816991
we will arrange the matter rather better   22.84803977990478
he only satisfied himself by milady s pulse that the case was not serious   162.16796475951463
charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize him   98.03540616690398
poor dear monsieur d artagnan said kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young man s hand   97.15121107393873
what jealousy   151.78123116449237
said d artagnan to himself i believe he has become more gascon than i am   11.386158505181228
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers   27.86943912231979
murmured athos   162.4514586073226
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer   205.37784427959667
monsieur de tréville   197.51440962892337
the shadow of a cloud passed over aramis s face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain   31.928812264204765
he persists in remaining there   151.6014627635904
fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue dantès had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word   118.61220993309371
sulpice   195.88325240462387
while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the millionaire   22.252464185504437
but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name   109.31474050526234
and i answered him to bring or send me that order and i would sign it   78.32276007466764
precisely   82.83403292348962
i saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses i heard my glass removed the same which is there now on the table   49.46273856656832
he must now get his bearings   58.284035123246134
what do you want with me   74.90366547877699
i am hardly nineteen   99.9824222440713
d arminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion   120.53238280344543
that is just said richelieu   288.6175329609134
and by whom   39.88079808077498
i shall hold him responsible for his protégé s misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination   59.83198650479062
there in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander vi   93.73036974556824
and you want my blessing   91.93328590150455
if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abbé busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth   60.46483140685245
not badly answered i faith said gondy laughing   248.18947554038658
asked the count   136.56681269838654
this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal   147.0476759047113
valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear eugénie   75.02847829559244
d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard   103.6943259063169
fortunately it is too short by six feet   69.50543624128491
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brig s departure its route its landings   121.19323214999885
silence laporte you may be overheard   185.4685279264486
danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of m   75.56248686896492
how can it be effected   92.19534059878042
the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs   127.7920117121202
and one day when we were viewing an execution i thought i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit   133.12871921546082
although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior   183.24673120250227
they were caught   155.18263972591197
franz introduced me to her at rome replied albert   162.1670826230028
cried morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an end   49.11164242421614
d artagnan bowed   47.866324463189656
or he will forget us added d artagnan   150.39782586772847
on the contrary he was very kind to me   111.10904191077884
they will be much less likely to   54.6855103869694
albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him   17.049161447056022
have i not my talent left   55.22674743551011
i should think so indeed almost as high as a tower   169.47390121269444
there is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget   138.04356714113695
nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a crœsus   106.17161882159968
exclaimed the baroness   118.25835416694345
the fourth horse had arrived   92.34319770398196
de tréville generally held so sacred became in an instant the annex of the antechamber   54.37469099793063
the rendezvous the place du palais cardinal   110.16540833041095
very well   61.77766200196205
the fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off   83.87814637183357
for the moment she wished nothing better   192.49814786644896
he opened a drawer and took out a purse   162.40293784834978
as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss   107.01390702262525
d artagnan printed as were most of the works of that period in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence more or less long in the bastille at amsterdam by pierre rouge   15.385771042401103
sign my lord   81.77410790582685
her nerves gave way and she sunk on the carpet   37.42361043721952
this evening   83.54951440644398
this is what has happened my brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me   62.74888320907612
the door was wide open a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yard a strange sight before so noble a mansion   181.0519101069624
i think he did not for he fell without a cry   152.5441751549225
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another   139.29719793639504
let us go you mean   124.28893871129148
m   3.8389176357782873
alas no   67.13469664641782
during the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man m   146.79714709360414
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl   6.398796175142422
arrested were they   146.0736783695837
it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dantès   189.14394677877112
asked beauchamp   77.81151179787093
you mistake i understand you perfectly   151.29912357138053
tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my repast   148.72556227294865
de tréville found la chesnaye who informed him that they had not been able to find m   111.19099348544758
jacopo will carry you to leghorn where monsieur noirtier awaits his granddaughter whom he wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar   189.44957804264936
i will not admit that word returned the young man   178.63960585339873
do not lose time comminges he continued   39.06792140914669
a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl   41.70980827716485
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial   155.41428046831987
you shall not call said felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver   79.62490658495659
the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand   48.34768782593201
but are you well assured sir   44.20119401382283
ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved   31.804797898666095
he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor   177.55326461455905
d artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised   111.93759378459009
and you say that he has a great influence over his compeers   39.0491237569843
asked the commissary with an air of doubt   119.92639371258647
then he looked anxiously at valentine   146.19193833266925
where if you please   120.9804327372859
this as you know is the important point of distinction between the covenanter and the cavalier   148.05946070276465
and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz d épinay   208.11771590488758
possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left   226.79754145475482
30145m oh very simply   148.9777448377351
after this second part of his discourse fixing his hawk s eye upon poor bonacieux he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation   198.86622063539835
then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save   116.38352037882484
it is the republic s which deputed david12 to devise a uniform for the academicians   144.59279298858633
but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious   69.09411926419678
no i never saw him until that moment and have not seen him since   230.3340956090596
is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper   80.98329524462798
i will say likewise he had apprised the count by a note of your intention and the count being absent i read the note and sat up to await you   16.202092889020946
but in the first place i should like to be certain of one thing   119.1135968479239
cried a young voice that made athos start   34.52459290649816
and this very morning the surgeon declared that if monsieur porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was i who had sent for him   255.15581270230467
he s not going on a message for he goes secretly   50.93198386557053
the battle of lens gained   39.554197795532005
inquired mordaunt   214.14743250213917
and in fact they went away quite proud and happy   150.89817305310365
will your excellency give your name or remain incognito   152.34334078383296
astonishment was at its height   103.48709169240243
the gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to mordaunt i hope sir said he you have no objection to make   90.15344749870934
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet   149.93427534709292

in 2001 the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg™ and future generations   181.93323542991732
now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege   110.05984929197558
the host on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses advanced respectfully to the door   59.385009872308075
he should have been   164.775882618027
as they were going down d artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader   97.37691855106117
there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere   123.4944420457244
will they not sign it   181.31664454253985
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir   70.54777734046006
and now my young friend for you will permit me i hope to give you that name said lord de winter on this very evening if agreeable to you i will present you to my sister milady clarik for i am desirous that she should take you into her good graces   168.46982753326168
then he added in a low tone yes   29.08452928029007
you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle   141.65974514128197
yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept   61.290016922349835
what did your father tell you m   200.915360307216
but if they refuse can i count on you   108.22420739469844
before a siege   193.9418454539254
morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o clock and to bring emmanuel   226.37421182690002
and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month   100.47258765381505
said d artagnan   94.6458258539843
each one went out by the open doors   85.02823285821529
morcerf thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door above which were his arms and which as we have said opened into the salon   38.32710972717146
nothing therefore was settled that day as emery s head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence   182.46242936469787
and your friend has nothing more to ask for madame de longueville   51.557261718779344
and he made the same friendly salute as d artagnan   129.49056918407751
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear moistened eyes raised to heaven   63.81970201093945
how so   114.0531676634383
it is his son   110.54045334347211
are you no longer my master or have i ceased to be your slave   172.45966239883353
leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house   98.33407165413001
luigi vampa   173.90750691583295
tell me where   152.37997661607318
said porthos   59.23072574636018
planchet   170.00704777427188
debray instead of answering allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous inquiry   153.79240426761916
monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him   164.35387457694043
what do you say maximilian   125.45027673897884
asked scarron   215.2475498521822
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels   223.9370374554632
on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose   54.25724018887161
the devil take you said aramis   146.16362051648778
here is your sword   246.97739008385415
we are lost   80.10730173953284
since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain   104.38079467242434
but what did you do yesterday after you left me   36.623692117555294
my dear grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justice thy words are words of gold   108.80606221929423
farewell   85.882802115179
i raised my head   143.68665476757602
do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated   115.64059086318312
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life   9.568271010910266
we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke   92.06481417948153
you received me very coldly   134.11691129248925
planchet began to sing un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin   134.6094343661849
he endeavored to speak but the words died on his lips   129.19005948080758
de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth   33.01745481615414
cavalcanti   56.454508709345646
one evening as i was looking over the wall i saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and i guessed that she was awaiting m   177.7650864852302
in a few minutes laporte was at the lodge   185.9028128428169
but among enemies it would be only a stratagem   29.625630215823378
yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less   31.04271336028657
the chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to hyères for a week   222.81188281526573
40168m no   95.43722383023939
opinions held in common are a ready bond of union   18.5412822858556
but did you see the queen   120.02712216835342
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said good night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier   83.32045997210534
you who love and are beloved   166.59933540444476
and now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjuteur   153.93833588071064
we leave you in an excellent tone of mind   191.45049975778244
where   99.7364192105356
franz d épinay   169.89088522733044
why not sir   113.92556035812069
yes and i take your brother with me   175.47483463257214
there they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted bethune and stationed himself between cambria and la venthie   163.19885447336367
said d artagnan   9.02388384595882
and aramis   31.955426589962187
but that is not all after rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like st   132.64357521713896
asked the prince   167.500301810079
had a real liking for tréville a royal liking a self interested liking it is true but still a liking   172.43269809781236
yes i know that he said but give me the particulars   55.278506766589665
the shudder of the three musketeers showed to d artagnan that his words began to make some impression on them   139.5540037472494
said franz interrupting himself   76.37882285564467
my master has ordered his horses at eight o clock precisely   200.065443326233
hum   103.23878679689896
eh no   13.838789047633199
is the baroness at home   275.39283883740427
he entered and on his way met the waiter   161.63346512218132
sire it is fatality   138.87839046640448
peste   151.0745288887797
but i was told he had four millions per annum   159.2484527978845
i should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house   46.64544005373422
and where is he now   136.10536455196294
d avrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room   54.65363302400736
aramis bit his lips till the blood came   85.8446357689619
and the notary   148.32447675785716
now for the wager   118.38809451776567
and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves that immense breaking of the ocean with her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans thou leavest thy servants lord to see if they be strong   147.04108895021022
gentlemen said athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we ready   39.14851458996357
i do not understand you   55.345477769645896
the general tore the handkerchief from his eyes   197.70659757230538
a woman whom i don t know but who is called milady   107.2814628275524
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing   29.45650125563658
porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them   196.4946767164938
these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of barrois   68.20691877377732
as we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him   193.03942650403584
what is it   13.527610988117743
all four of us   131.6181923467277
almost   122.33665904673842
at this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed   151.58533437116816
said the count   98.91409249916482
7   97.53742099314823
either we shall be attacked or not   64.54952782698345
have you seen him   49.1197978946921
asked he   185.20114427049845
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years   197.46242746730204
it wants ten minutes to nine said he   115.89448908191842
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans   78.77189750193969
and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur s study   154.43288578789185
from master bazin to be sure   173.67288581844718
he added whirling his sword around him   156.02413538350834
look well at me   61.62760096877273
quite the contrary   52.39527995258992
why then doesn t he attend to it himself as at chantilly   186.60702024057542
we are going with a mission to her majesty the queen of england   160.6434412571371
accordingly that same evening d artagnan repaired to the quarters of athos whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of spanish wine an occupation which he religiously accomplished every night   147.4512248954137
my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused   72.48136769941765
and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow   93.58216056263731
unhappy man   155.72748548439301
an opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained   269.8630908208577
on the contrary the lackeys knew milady perfectly   128.25805414430607
it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion it is true then that all our actions leave their traces some sad others bright on our paths   157.77004872612127
and he richelieu the french minister the national minister would be ruined   153.79929266187898
another queen in want of help   180.6482290489086
you told me that your instinct and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations i think on the contrary that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs well you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern   166.24449612879027
he was thirty three when he escaped   148.5130535842027

andrea visibly changed countenance   53.540670651116336
you told me to hope and i almost did so   93.2643500663302
hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m   123.1959061534523
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again   150.81246067767864
but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your publisher   148.12486835555092
well yes you are right   219.45356680058774
e   139.85682988153818
a cavalier charged with an important mission had come an hour before your arrival seeking hospitality at the very moment that the curé summoned to the bedside of a dying person left not only his house but the village for the entire night   169.81877013988122
in the position of porthos d artagnan would have been perfectly happy   62.548412538567874
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings   163.27664072869578
do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existence my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum   137.38805228974329
i ate some bread and some fruit   84.29918693458642
he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still insensible   123.34613623118274
i shall follow the count s directions   70.80143112746399
i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces   72.46841385666971
fine sport by jove   101.29604615258685

toxicology chapter 53   172.7046436668191
i am said i the little abbé who reads lives of the saints and translates judith into verse   118.21761242118559
said a voice at the end of the gallery   43.017312676723265
i am an honorable man   192.68446554106043
and now in her turn let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade but my debt   47.78135963487681
to wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for you   88.45785538092272
yes yes replied d artagnan   99.94081734663843
it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and d artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men   35.34964061156481
accept my compliments   74.65758693728753
this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau   252.12569450197634
it is well said he kissing it   227.6790889687323
because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates   2.5133936637154477
he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him   189.63039637720078
monsieur de chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation   204.43210650445232
let us see said d artagnan   76.15060548543086
returned debray carelessly   118.19583322686948
but his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted   169.49404327487258
if you pass before a house which is being built look up for fear a stone should fall upon your head   159.49933688866605
no god forbid said the cardinal   84.89118271707407
eh give it to me   187.538023958987
see to these horses   75.36734865602256
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres   73.80624199553489
inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension   113.34196757578935
i will ask his servant   140.88707311507474
no   144.33218711314382
besides we will have no words about it   148.69603265733548
at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless   95.89115837723241
and he held out his hand   48.18826098723082
then when he thought i had said all he advanced toward me   27.73375419958741
f   125.7377594897495
tell it me sir   44.480383115628
for a time the delightful remembrance of madame bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed   159.0463930813396
then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling   138.48881706408142
well   115.8632245720701
the tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to obey   62.391004401046864
our interview must be kept secret   133.52143911136298
why the thing has made a tremendous noise   129.6461958982345
everything fell out as mme   80.1396908210349
what will i do with him   124.77451140317255
it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven   10.859144507824283
d artagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad   7.853459800926927
and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements   110.84106328418535
i maintain my original resolution   117.73130070425196
said cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose   126.43655086379744
the audience m   208.1950759496645
and how   37.15838475813675
to brussels if you like   109.97575302095446
la ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the duke s health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified whenever my lord pleases   70.47476800381844
at this order given in athos s habitually calm manner the face of the gascon relaxed and porthos s brow grew smooth   69.5179140077349
i have not yet seen him   49.02520818845119
he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is monsieur mordaunt   156.95849678614928
yes   148.5932955837261
i tell you what m   69.90306337423672
well i am in a maze said porthos   100.28801265403605
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend   115.82274650145217
dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of faria s mind   106.37184172213199
say no more of that madame said felton   136.77410188977666
come and roll me to bed   69.87998502449585
come grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk   261.26514453638225
i am innocent   214.63477995166082
it is you tréville   59.14373115331165
doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head   53.38248909772719
what is that madame   126.81147858060446
the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amélie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty francs   100.24630459495725
madame de saint méran heard her   230.02007042663638
you should have allowed me to sleep   189.9247011705976
willingly my lord   146.0748204921674
halt   65.3440837672681
so pray keep your places like athos whose calmness is entirely laudable   107.33785399491968
hate reproach the man that has spared my son s life   2.964357902897376
give it to me later   149.7502732038793
here   82.02917924744409
every career is open to you   13.378771551845716
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars   32.85200689773676
dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice   184.13760999657228
three months passed away   79.11766347796015
were you there then   76.61707292034002
the queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lips and without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter   43.32049625556462
and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger   116.26129612649855
cried anne to humble myself thus   82.08281071936415
yes a base coward murmured d artagnan   189.20398454274647
condemned by parliament   180.06401144572018
no   34.60557606881768
if she flies kill her   222.8027451630065
but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost senseless   65.71352575385734
i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself   123.04559784893449
he sent us one of his angels   127.79123079059828
but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day   160.755808801049
come come   76.44889593632465
well do you comprehend now   239.39424184041204
what   104.66242231735126
morrel s daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw   196.76082254550903
four large vessels recently built had just been launched   244.59480583976116
i admire i love him for i know his former adventures but i shall not speak to him until the day after to morrow   58.26948488190237
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didn t mean mischief   3.4580542938559233
how many have we killed of them a dozen   151.1378318901042
look my lord cardinal said aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love   178.671887418344
is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa   82.41626980054494
asked the baron rising and going a step backward   35.05247540047779
i am sure of it   166.66492447297617
we must joke with the guards we must gain the good will of the soldiers since we can t corrupt them   54.641816063031065
perhaps he even suspects the person   172.63425196810869
you have had some proofs of their truth   170.1061381312408
the house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea   130.61140051391308
upon my word i think he acted very generously   26.900935175068483
no indeed   112.72815185236695
yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly   202.47389563588462
the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices one deep whisper intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred   147.71477594466026
a track of blood on the snow marked his course   114.66700432475139
these places are bought   85.82419262810622
know that monsieur de bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop   179.13149441444676
there was a moment of silence   108.90916308958444
alas   89.28703185242891
between saint venant and aire   31.06194248138047
and therefore said d artagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abbé d herblay   236.3368488831193
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard   77.3431214692636
i understand cried athos with a gentle blush   69.70654843810027
and pray what may it be   143.89625035830971
toward the end of the service the queen seeing comminges standing near her waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the louvre said in a whisper go comminges and may god aid you   110.90839146241788
the valet re appeared almost instantly and having shaved his master assisted him to dress entirely in black   90.69175456243745
the last count of spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained   132.19404256799413
noirtier s eye still retained its inanimate expression   119.66780730945413
because you think i am drunk   157.14513205320821
asked valentine   81.47776017983058
do you think she said with a ghastly smile that i shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations   55.11903797334353
you should have left it to me then madame who know what they are   63.19376332933034
i know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested   55.71878440887616
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states   121.5748912538387
what wants your excellency of me   89.25742268630518
the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step   66.05053804563498
death to the cardinal   169.46501400992582
but when you leave him for instance   165.89344274139202
surely you must be mistaken   134.28921816534515
no replied d artagnan   89.95620256535017
is it possible that god has abandoned his representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably   198.9574446590151
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect   186.43550599984997
my lord let us come to terms   68.31003334248726
well replied la carconte do as you like   165.65425040901738
and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care   184.40278968235143
he went the first time to save the honor of a great queen   137.34296668876303
let us sit down   230.9715610626233
with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar   150.39994070859925
albert felt the blood mounting to his brow   141.38055247766346
some grand personage a prince i believe they said the count of monte cristo   115.9192496730851
villefort fell on his knees   123.16597099610391
yet i fancy as thou sayest that i see something   19.87570357044892
ridiculous   20.865997362428175
in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all   147.40521634765614
undoubtedly the call came from faria s dungeon   101.52060640041859
unfasten it or i will break it in   125.59572585241588
there is no desert where a bird can not pass over one s head where a fish can not leap out of the water where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal   165.62871457514723
certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land   45.77974469061547
happy   14.650812379920652
franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their places three forward and one at the helm he resumed the conversation   109.31341305919135
the morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze   228.0372455448429
i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5 000 francs   151.63114503900812
asked the old man   195.0322768563922
my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act   211.90147721352076
what are you doing   194.60724178715623
the ground was trampled by horses   130.2792201569904
really i like him extremely   5.319982097847046
yes excellency   107.78269875590057
as a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply   68.63643560662244
listen   117.58063781645946
thanks monsieur   154.78956848631137
and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing   100.50033143655014
it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness   102.14328733931906
and madame danglars four   33.44946178932224
luigi was not mistaken   183.7394336006806
cried porthos who was not completely taken in by d artagnan s gasconades   75.43768185818024
but the king where is the king   133.50453170022448
i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent   153.38161993170922
the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife   216.47756593261627
die   98.38656451048861
20356m adieu   103.3520189359759
albert entered   75.29040062867338
andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat   80.77071155425932
we keep him in the cellar   65.59485303061274
to die whilst doing a good deed   138.11475582009402
but at this moment two shots were fired   136.31366281370305
he is gone to noisy   113.50275725162022
said the count   89.0039256973423
they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen   99.20053679311994
who are you then   132.2447071423253
and so he remained silent   140.04979321279157
ah what else is there   189.38365141485002
chapter xxii   76.43387242858327
as for you morrel this is the secret of my conduct towards you   128.21156266908508
but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then   31.742821916762736
as was his custom d artagnan presented himself at milady s at about nine o clock   128.34955224343045
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him   176.5637185709199
as he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention   201.16908584897735
cried porthos are we all going away then   73.16817058319936
certainly there are people whom i love   126.13583964625579
when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover   21.45525410743933
aramis whistled for bazin but bazin was asleep in the ante chamber and aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him   130.64766261222985
asked the wounded man   112.4734363337681
and a few of those bottles of old burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain   191.64405429138822
adores it   85.87420389823194
half an hour s rest is enough replied the gascon   8.850012583783297
i am now on my road   83.25012612493778
there were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls valenciennes lace english veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called the corbeille   165.66328478731822
he would break you like glass   204.65629225344156
thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it   92.11556420521912
d artagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and listened   97.32135563792646
you have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for i was about to form another plan and leave you   128.3683097657519
her own hands were moist and icy cold   149.53367809646645
i was a very insignificant person   156.78023324184204
why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a hay cart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierre s bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things   98.16530469443666
oh no   110.77948637684653
and let me give you a piece of advice   133.57167528495467
that s a snare said athos   238.82550962873978
and you were wrong madame   140.84778668174692
coupé thirty five francs   141.59361900628878
my dear albert said he let me introduce to you m   194.37786377339512
but touching these spanish affairs i think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the don carlos matter   105.09585862467027
morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant   108.63613853069992
did you fear that we should forget it   107.15479554438384
but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended   163.32381889866025
that is the way the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma   180.0395976066692
yes yes   220.1283220468901
we shall meet again shall we not monsieur   151.26221262966794
silence porthos   111.39850079433693
could you engage to bring him to me to morrow morning at ten o clock on the pont du louvre   168.2120438317227
he votes for you for he belongs to the opposition   194.10413884629654
no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret   194.3265770682787
oh no monsieur replied monte cristo   98.35436465792245
villainous host   117.66575932540397
everyone had just seen it pass   25.85025558853536
so au revoir dear athos   40.527223717704615
porthos and aramis trembled with rage   159.96475195727945
take a post chaise or a carriage   57.712666294146224
he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me   230.24291139447013
the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward   102.12010192704253
asked the monk   136.6084703985304
the fish bites the fish bites   173.96272841050623
edmond hoped he was dying   182.57086275747068
there s ten o clock striking at greenwich   36.535272392664865
does your majesty remember when playing in the park of fontainebleau or in the palace courts at versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder   88.58343961837195
yes i own it   135.6579384890897
indeed   140.74911670574443
this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of elba   221.6639614748267
as long as i don t fight with him it is the same to me with whom i fight   182.4326000664625
what is his name   44.18011673423828
and i shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts   70.85730520049219
captivity the first day let us return to milady whom a glance thrown upon the coast of france has made us lose sight of for an instant   129.8107255427199
she was at length appeased and the conversation turned upon him while kitty was assisting her mistress   12.091208313759566
mme   5.330984596449511
and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat   76.16357170243863
divan walls ceiling floor were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets   6.963473042434515
now you have the key of the cellar   107.26354050160019
i have but one promise and but one heart to give   55.09943642499614
which would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example   69.36711502807182
then that s my thief replied d artagnan   199.4493052151135
but you have then a valet de chambre who knows paris   201.38198670713456
the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now useless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell   9.03711357526069
de villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of père lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family   11.710859091844753
quite the contrary planchet   74.64429066719138
wretch   81.20963101353698
b   140.52932902794092
it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh   91.5303319187169
oh it was cruel to us and dare i say it   117.70282464866474
and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of it   203.9814228867826
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand   217.72429831732904
the usurper converted   167.85720270959348
the abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming   67.74657427206805
all eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse   154.0707621595131
d artagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer   10.86176880262066
with discretion d artagnan remained behind   106.79355831558577
cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m   132.22516437567776
at length with a violent effort at self control the name of that woman   66.54707341760506
d artagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak   145.04151949439907
well then if you felt so sure replied the new comer putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair allow me to say my dear gérard that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the door   135.54132928985362
and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place   148.45121087474263
the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor   170.69128052716923
beauchamp was thunderstruck   164.80501969033577
i am certain of it   34.150990002964576
except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction   85.11143351378402
let us do better than that said athos   26.894369566428537
not in the least   178.05467267572723
who then are you   82.04311938668516
monsieur the comte de la fere he cried i supplicate you   113.449471153168
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt   151.55252563804294
they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers and here they are   89.0140281362747
i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said monte cristo   172.16073077351876
indeed i do said athos   107.07368257740112
ah   149.9972933830428
the conversation took a cheerful turn   106.15609371993244
what you demand of me is serious then   116.12941493938408
adieu valentine adieu   109.06276236082537
i love most fondly i love madly i love as a man who would give his life blood to spare her a tear i love valentine de villefort who is being murdered at this moment   26.840510626571245
for me   136.26866964733122
you see someone pays me a visit   174.7109483274426
ah   104.86151198138606
mr   128.70819183701252
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men   110.82195759770917
the others are on the mantle piece of your excellency s bedroom   111.41592295842187
i give you my word of honor   42.519920571060936
it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb   134.2714488451674
your excellency said peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at hand   236.12239347875652
the discourse is over   121.18767305477262
however the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs   74.32928395497579
oh now i may say so   184.20249003500425
murmured d artagnan   150.856297024757
you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice   180.411480251379
what is the matter then   201.43039575712157
excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this morning   245.4673308012146
still persisted franz i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person   163.20816410431522
he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man   120.87956402169279
ah ah   22.777131609409494
albert rose and took his hat   41.90115195513491
ah ah   191.1111051128185
hastily snatching up the lighted candle i hurried to the staircase   140.96394486268306
sir replied d artagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young   127.64017932952673
are you there now   152.7723167376286
no i thank you   63.92375742326536
morrel was mad   14.647809248358953
and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you   15.597592819075558
replied the prince   17.658850480933296
what monsieur will you leave us so soon   118.67500949338765
confidence and love made him a giant   100.14807946836198
porthos said aramis athos has already told you that you are a simpleton and i am quite of his opinion   75.12583135421892
and if you will wait only a few minutes for me as soon as i have concluded my business with that friend as it is growing late i will come back and reconduct you to the louvre   158.64410547848635
but in vain did he rack his imagination   78.30829731976033
maximilian morrel said she   33.73696077940825
and thereby you have lied twice monsieur for i saw it fall   167.85211913744465
the guards under the command of m   156.06462939521322
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word   180.28375135276545
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saint méran arose from her pillow   141.4854017944588
you are mistaken you will not die   74.34696738279246
how   154.73979925332225
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose   46.75902251438205
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house   155.78734633624217
i am all attention said eugénie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze   28.951562707548746
resumed the citizen well monsieur my wife was abducted yesterday morning as she was coming out of her workroom   124.78628617914639
there they are   95.0183276009593
i adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my way for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes   104.18767733271261
the palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls   169.78351865259677
descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell   235.66569314245402
said albert   152.54539334059248
my friend   228.84652767132457
alas   109.6943512353336
queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these   111.36428929689212
m   113.67708807072837
the young and high spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath   135.69247482253763
a second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman   212.60468174743158
the young king would perhaps show us some gratitude   89.0284867102857
the one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch   230.91698881339738
asked beauchamp   185.41402970793484
a worthy man who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married and securing her a position   130.68324399908226
she is gone said he   70.76517987485352
thanks monsieur said the monk with one of those smiles that made bragelonne shudder   138.98762903488785
in the name of our child   98.97139946310739
but the first was repugnant to him   72.82766023391358
but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord   147.89379691487312
she will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the bourse   38.15336607554893
she also thinking to protect me was acting against me   140.66653893315083
the apparition chapter 101   141.72917801550946
like monsieur pixérécourt   157.18963935714945
you ride on our lackey s horses and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand at short stages   18.19488782128238
i can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of us   14.672222898033937
but he has wealth i believe already   313.83728898705897
pardieu monsieur   128.1264451400662
baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him   141.81072899560087
asked monte cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hope   276.19290256512954
morrel to be admitted   87.07782286141759
the cardinal repressed another smile   110.44971326947503
beauchamp did the same   151.54445241866958
no i am lost   104.07967813032538
while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole   171.63480231814356
an enemy   172.45188482607168
why all these precautions   47.044219397036144
no it was not dead   22.903175719411948
but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness   198.26161582357346
from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no one so much the worse   53.45094566659552
gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleurs de lis embroidered   128.0695065326556
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day   234.1892131221508
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends   201.84656793047373
he is   187.45377049569464
and yet milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic   73.97304527186947
speak   61.28841577132188
i have them   121.02360585252967
has she made a fortune also   209.1842669768697
no my lord   4.954054959070447
maximilian goes with me said the count in his kindest and most persuasive manner   69.62802516465621
oh thank you a thousand times   161.22024036015364
meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court   104.74456387591745
le baron franz d épinay   210.9394074920274
sir said valentine i will do all i can to live for there are two beings who love me and will die if i die my grandfather and maximilian   116.85749066606908
and if the king permits me returned the gascon i shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered   139.73789578351654
that she might have been detained in paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband   141.2338867184327
if we may believe the signs grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of people   173.75159669661997
chapter 115   156.638146057794
on two of my shirts   87.44487615785181
asked d artagnan   113.68759114636465
you don t comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me   69.29242266984411
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark   13.919441872303011
ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents   122.81282410620535
i must and will see him again   119.95675876058768
however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing   124.94291766975667
my friend said he here is a proof of it   52.07474447127437
diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired   122.12039067125498
chapter lxxxv   179.09042082060506
i will avenge you and cruelly   163.12456519358952
this time my determination is irrevocably taken   117.21807794100312
aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times   101.52833425916216
indeed said château renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one   158.94776989068407
it is true you called her thus   141.80310134669116
hold hold hold   77.33904482842541
gentlemen said athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together   139.6498731997549
oh   151.16560028547477
said villefort to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow   6.217950411786063
bah   19.42104598507119
villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king s attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it   108.72361124337372
you are insane monsieur   125.80747018165451
nothing else than i say search   5.30770666163987
they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture   65.3826607464722
the count advanced to meet him   89.4477301759735
your lordship does me much honor said the host and i thank you sincerely for your kind wish   214.61610542704244
said d artagnan do you begin to believe that it s a ruined cause and that what with your harrisons joyces bridges and cromwells we shall never get the upper hand   7.729723447770738
they unsheathe and that s all that is said   81.51291689592281
the noise had ceased   102.63286883387468
the englishman looked and was seized with astonishment   53.13763684643915
you think of everything   253.60451140226886
said the prince laughing i thought we should come to that   7.865456979427961
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions   81.35019681359125
you very well know porthos that i continue to study theology for that purpose   70.77127470618503
jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted   120.41316601849647
and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward   90.95701476289115
teresa and luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits   70.59215358580067
asked the disturbed host   54.513550959266965
groslow jumped in followed by mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of london   67.9818725621909
the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honoré itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris   254.0291784756639
de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion   216.85611869548924
deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing   167.45024132219203
my daughter mademoiselle danglars   72.7974144538752
are you hungry   75.38302083592484
it is he   221.20529439331426
stop   130.3662592801448
the count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her shoulder   122.74321589352355
50090m chapter 103   30.86198480781522
but never mind that my boy go and announce your arrival and let her know all your hopes and prospects   206.5062992941513
well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot   85.47140478616893
false   55.4357711466304
truth my friend   179.5790052518596
albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words   194.52414349443043
have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial   183.91480393544992
but towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them   84.17692825061383
revenge yourself then edmond cried the poor mother   134.25561481828404
you reconcile me d artagnan   112.3182303815997
you   48.750661039969
no but they mean to make a fronde as they call it said guitant   119.89586026264713
and now remember one thing monsieur officer that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness   132.28888570084212
what matters it about broussel it is a name not a thing   113.89926803560378
yes   168.16522482053827
for how much   193.36728615382276
and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you   102.18969639612543
here are our three leaves of absence which came from monsieur de tréville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from i don t know where   82.89779780436035
d art exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand   216.041924168886
what then   167.18760768358067
yes said the baron assassinated   177.17175715287033
they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner   129.7165562799908
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer   38.86964904243149
it would have been more simple   156.62883896960673
ah   119.76426585496759
then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine   111.18842770063064
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible   106.28610176627953
i   170.1610391040021
olivain we have come into possession of two horses but i have lost my own   157.26846602201113
e   88.70452638178466
however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him   64.60815697099274
one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory   150.2796189891861
i undertake all that concerns the king   176.78621787976232
after having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his permission   188.4694007459003
suddenly   88.4348169161019
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped   109.61382427007888
he leaves me in paris as our separation will conduce to his benefit   156.90535567610937
i will have those letters   170.58771644044117
sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth   136.74463051715128
i shot two with my double barrelled gun and two more with my pistols but i was then disarmed and two were still left   147.2012911733313
d artagnan returned   153.17385060494888
then continued château renaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champs élysées you only want a mistress   138.03056310256412
come your excellency the count added turning to franz here is luigi vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed   108.9407636942473
albert had often heard not from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangers the description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina   267.7256409625261
yes said aramis through an infamous act of treason   69.5662351484053
yes my wife pointed him out to me one day   88.90177353564874
said jacopo   97.15601887651934
you mean monsieur zaccone i presume   20.61885952177454
he can not pardon her the history of the saraband   82.34557865199758
i am sure of it   91.62554252881138
what   206.42990065668292
and what may be that description   116.37944388466408
carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air   179.91250080592175
i could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer myself   148.0265891507536
terror recalled me to myself   185.62336030152898
before we are alarmed we see correctly   225.35355522548429
quite   66.1179954595506
the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen   94.90042855312468
here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm eaten table which with the stool and the goat skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell   109.10270077441291
nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him   2.9454788722445073
with hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended mordaunt had advanced one more step a threatening terrible step toward de winter   47.772520127252164
where is béthune athos   131.56285721039603
but what could these men whom i at first took for robbers want with me and why is monsieur bonacieux not here   329.3344059861074
you may copy it give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www   179.3499521085713
one throw is soon made   100.35480055212281
so you would rob the count of monte cristo   98.80148831340053
the monk recovered his usual expression   7.084961247370444
take this ring   240.90032293358178
0233m the physician may be mistaken   184.4826931575318
when at the shout in the name of the king an officer ran up and seeing the uniforms ill treated he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand and brought unexpected help to the guards   70.221828940287
he made himself a count so that he is not one at all   54.98179003964254
what can she do in it   140.6766638037143
if you happen to have any jewels hide them directly   29.881823995638015
this young man terrifies me my lord   5.327955151405405
who was your liberator   114.01538382351652
what took place at portsmouth august 23 1628 chapter lx   97.96114360923903
cried villefort   173.3943719200053
i am   107.30905523400938
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine o clock in the morning to take a third letter   172.1027904229396
bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered   136.52109602459024
go ahead my friend said athos   6.983935479408231
said madame de chevreuse trying to read in athos s eyes   134.01602976009815
i call on you where are you   185.5338951370827
come sir said he addressing broussel silence that woman and follow me   204.75814477085078
but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure   100.74790928414956
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all   45.63392077141967

but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage   151.44448258569145
asked morrel   151.4078855051799
exclaimed the duke rubbing his hands   64.57149339513168
in the first carriage with m   13.72985823388656
he even came to force m   75.97867967824445
as to the rest the life of the four young friends was joyous enough   245.93023688924342
they sing let them pay the piper   175.75692602932477
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs   195.78989028236685
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there   197.14241967325313
i am the chevalier de rochefort answered the other the equerry of monsieur le cardinal richelieu and i have orders to conduct you to his eminence   85.2236401405562
then taking up his account book he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away   206.34798775152393
which i believe does not contain one   68.63618490229629
for no one knew that edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept it   154.29637525069697
the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man   151.8401807447251
and how does m   129.24103035696953
early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior   148.22596908304305
your mother your sister   172.15918189196586
he walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent   143.07577516315342
but if they are numerous observed mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have us   28.05463555309123
perhaps if i employed my strength against women i might perchance find them weaker than myself and consequently conquer them   55.17153701340921
and yet me you see plainly that i love you   162.36222839556615
i am afraid for the king s safety   50.11793196059551
and these men are in france my lord   139.47075413482972
what is it   42.21727463340527
give him to me   110.37926049650933
all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera   55.16954898728838
louis de bourbon prince de condé who since the death of his father henri de bourbon was called in accordance with the custom of that period monsieur le prince was a young man not more than twenty six or twenty seven years old with the eye of an eagle agl occhi grifani as dante says aquiline nose long waving hair of medium height well formed possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldier that is to say the rapid glance quick decision fabulous courage   201.47437015184252
this must be impossible   91.3293153322741
his name is said she in her turn   99.88625343399201
you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your mind   174.04790145655866
the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger   189.19633796608488
and for me   52.19124125844553
interrupted the young man warmly   42.764191302234096
what you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me   75.91489770570945
in a dungeon   204.74106176229122
my god how agitated you seem   73.21191470377332
and as i am just now excessively annoyed i shall go from home   139.67807608063848
on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment   96.74591657130188
you knew him returned the inspector with a smile   174.73084321735377
for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available asset   192.09273002224782
great heavens   131.6685891658125
no replied athos   100.86541024003769
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house   110.21421736699367
really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with man that is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace   204.2716680010874
avanti   118.69699722590401
grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word pointed   29.387742232659292
what influence can i possibly have over a bandit   60.85826425727765
but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language   98.90710677720985
to one in edmond s position the diamond certainly was of great value   53.95873670644037
and he fired two pistols   204.60925439568996
cried blaisois   207.32282184874413
he was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to him   91.48871794706152
but said andrea ill temperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me i wish the devil had taken you   168.78285028268346
on   55.100501797575305
asked milady   84.49633050280613
50231m maximilian said the count you should not look on the graves but there   108.53083975201761
he left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate   84.76357680961334
then his master having admitted him barricaded the door afresh and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar   119.43654665851265
asked monte cristo   22.588348451077835
how do you know it   9.29434862313525
morrel s clear eye was for the moment clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large tear rolled down his cheek   22.510303127850023
i cover mine said d artagnan   65.79460661910485
a weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to overthrow a great design   126.4881460720226
de villefort s   86.70856547800368
do you wish it known that you are interested about him monsieur le comte   74.09614846320434
it was about eleven o clock at night   133.57194423443832
straw work   110.35834807223566
dear good renée whispered villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker   87.66452189203792
we shall go out all the same   142.37990610793779
he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side   116.37911349634669
you were at the festival of your marriage   129.67735638897165
i will not refuse   139.4275521214349
asked milady   141.3259582217867
but if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you   123.32743166695755
good   121.743112691336
murmured d artagnan smiling as he pronounced the imprecation   102.1080418404715
well and what then   90.76744720958833
but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning   172.08466436320285
i have done all in my power to oppose it   162.34658941979728
asked monte cristo   120.68287679464432
and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest   40.04994875056522
well i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois   101.95897460108318
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present   113.79176136172862
yes said dantès   168.14191223100767

noirtier s room he perceived two figures through the half open door   190.14430754051966
and he is dead   226.63807840036438
father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room   94.9612182670064
and you think him capable of being exact   167.3475221886398
this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause   88.96197906699462
i   167.70792716960108
this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms   190.3558196457754
asked another musketeer without addressing anyone in particular but on the contrary speaking to everybody   92.89543673940379
porthos began to be suspicious   89.72772726119624
but at that period we were not at war   170.23065334111
but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him   116.36000361767469
blaisois returned disconsolate to the hotel of the grand roi charlemagne and when athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his adventure   123.03545613832479
yes indeed i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me   82.03800126879275
end of the port wine mystery   142.58005449428768

i will expose all   113.2660384927091
and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan   98.6884403053896
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it   97.84153314152026
bravo   80.52182818593556

i have had greater men than you arrested guitant   112.88335319662183

i never jest   47.59567214173154
you have credit with your landlord then   83.3526880349965
thanks to the attentions of raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him   47.810127786368895
that is to say stammered milady i am not really very intimate with any of them   2.0658943895519712
athos shook his dead doubtfully   114.45673175703492
asked raoul   135.98422350364575

for france   154.0011086988644
the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it   268.00198327939574

it is all one to us to us who do not command to morrow s expedition   132.16878609256688

who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed   5.40359585841604
20033m such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with m   140.8201416481744
yes you are right   144.74335787807658
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling   101.71002244498912
she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth   97.00443794723675
the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé s ladder of cords   135.91902051275596
the last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived gondy   99.95992802799388
well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one   104.23729988782397
it is not worthwhile to wait for that said andrea   75.91924964295777
noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door   179.74544701827483

thus i was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen   182.0543621605007
gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to rest   147.39209896946977

none of this had escaped the count and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer   125.38702293687979
byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them   86.90429661139692
as the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire   131.11928833857414
only return again at eleven o clock   96.28677670065326
that farewell struck madame de villefort like the executioner s knife   131.35702338608118
that will do for us   22.006851862704664
he had assigned himself the task of saving a man s life that day   71.09004780774072
take care   59.43847397739866
then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with doubt   109.61402976423759
a telegraph   152.07007832632812
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion   106.20421815095627
and i understand what the count said that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion   210.3322521193537
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same   68.21495839844523
he had fainted   24.757338082392153
how are you sir   152.74723582702546
i ought to ask your majesty s pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth   131.8627460156919
there was a brief silence   178.51708977493885
good my child   173.33608420378576
well let us pledge the ring but upon one condition   123.28081513521681
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m   176.02299371723026
said she   167.9754191523536
villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child   61.124248561645366
but said bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window   133.41070916070382
egad   122.86493441170705
will you go up with me   81.82450010731858
what have you to say in your defense   10.589479108607051
zounds   156.02717359880273
but is this all you have to say to me   108.6441222653195
yes we will wait replied valentine who revived at these words   109.008665629759
and he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after madame danglars departure before he left the house   122.62458902387084
40078m my father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard   112.21751609010823
alas speak to me more gently father   139.6445835003701
you are here in the apartment destined for you madame   24.14574993128872
oh we have three millions for our police   94.85616245490347
the sentinel opened the door   126.94146806739248
go   175.88442966045335
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me   160.6383859780407
i was saying to him only yesterday you are imprudent monsieur count   174.34426370213174
d artagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object   30.848404496940205
the hostess who knew d artagnan s skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair   136.19082704115823
loose half drunk imposing the king s musketeers or rather m   110.15686073562028
and i may even say the sight of you increases my dismay   93.1362118184775
mouston said porthos saddle vulcan and bayard   153.42185793876882
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages   177.91162204605394
you have decidedly some genius at your control   116.42105633960092
an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step   105.43802337688761
bonacieux   123.54318825615674
it was the fault of their horses not theirs   46.54658929376777
murmured coquenard and he tried to smile   46.58785542860247
but a humpbacked general   92.107392233966
and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter   209.6593521937445
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not   177.16558616709287
said the cardinal   14.605686804648514
you were writing   103.8641123142695
and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance   59.510017110399595
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting   142.83605172507882
to whom do you desire to leave this fortune   267.32857042475456
at the same time on the opposite side that is towards edward s room valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor   126.00845370881147
your affectionate anne buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter   105.41650227242397
but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon   108.40213101360297
the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row   151.5265787035505
in fifteen or twenty days i shall set out for la rochelle with the army   87.18044848412137
but if you deliver me up to your masters i have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death   131.7871758973059
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength   128.63016730294336
the grand marshal did   235.43405821238218
yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one s patrons   142.25261615714717
as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning   134.24676420154586
asked d avrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier   48.26214309681892
my mother thought me dead   122.37055246080436
no no she answered i would rather remain here   149.4881179057764
my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting   110.19098266208965
monseigneur said athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a woman s letter but it is neither signed marion de lorme nor madame d aiguillon   85.4345562013301
one has never the last word with such a man   188.35758458940956
count i have reflected on the matter said franz i thank you for your courtesy but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo   77.88594581589103
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged   21.819271855571344
the inspector visited one after another the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government   63.959482735738746
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor   85.65285945220067
when i supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due thou knowest it is not my own vengeance i pursue but the deliverance of a whole nation that i implore   182.60343372326423
p   2.6748821780585956
diavolo   136.76514478626848
monsieur de cavois   103.29852827054253
now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way   159.5148184975563
i thought so my lord said felton   212.9624917828903
no on the contrary i am not inclined to laugh said athos suppressing a sigh   73.96935253496423
albert approached   213.90203595244984
dantès dived again and remained a long time beneath the water   55.39606625451091
what do you mean   251.6674597596044
but who will distribute these things   118.1014304944645
you have today earned the right to make inquiries here   254.38850452710398
follow me sir   120.0043638897511
d artagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to return   159.73931371780378
my only fear is that he will be too strong for you   9.512095109742603
if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis i really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de voiture   183.63103187066918
i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile   122.84009405083046
and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect   66.17135875111302
cried rochefort   146.1310528567815
can it be can it possibly be the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina hey   87.95271689944933
my carriage shall take you back   167.564887775642
if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and worn out shoes on my feet you would not have known me   118.97959849592915
said dantès wiping his brow with his sleeve   142.40605253694238
i came here direct from the castle of st   160.33528795971785
say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort   153.00613955297774
asked the young lieutenant   11.512501530631312
as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention   140.48676070883454
set out for naples the hague or st   154.90299955744578
and his name   15.41152682924482
yes replied porthos coughing   139.96601006239683
grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm all lyons will hasten to welcome him   88.42620429652102
this being properly done they drew the comte de wardes close to his servant   140.82219240280904
zounds   109.11777423002113
the scotch he exclaimed the scotch i called my faithful to whom i trusted myself when i could have fled to oxford   83.77202867173992
this operation proved as great a success as the first   179.43128839271142
she must have returned to the louvre   56.94071699328822
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced   65.30155500158274
and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character   165.4108193746694
i say that it was you who gave me the wine   137.67454374371638
he said pointing to the bodies of his wife and child see are you well avenged   143.43924081230963
the 28th of february 1815 at half past two in the afternoon   104.18532447288227
that is the reason which has induced you to leave via reggio where you have lived since the death of your wife   68.72019136034041
asked aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished   94.97574396097555
that s my idea my lord   94.34678977010466
yes   177.59147894673717
what is it   110.74684148806246
and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spot the appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening   71.44773781919474
boisrenard   91.09567515065605
felton let me die   161.92352951106184
madame is searching for you everywhere   114.2358682307979
as for patience i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the day   81.61180856372255
is there any crime in this request   130.28958659766909
has he built one here then   103.66509115035252
yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a religious tendency   98.21377148203013
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priest s wig   150.99455474668326
org contact section 4   67.72814824502734
said the count   79.98385011334051
yes with frenchmen and frenchmen like you   98.76444160350124
at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder   42.43589153929729
i also intend from this time to work on my own account   153.5911980325126
no   151.94102504250532
never   178.611798776137
but said he did you observe one very singular thing   96.03784285907689
no   185.98337030582158
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form   45.03021490900082
ah here you are monsieur she said in her naturally calm voice   76.15962044034757
ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the street   23.658046737531862
nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising   61.12230993233648
oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument   63.138378787980024
they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho   140.8601892719714
a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner   119.77264580399098
oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself half malicious half ferocious   214.34013534886168
and this this is my fortune not chimerical but actual   181.96262844879777
coquenard turning about in his chair a real feast epulœ epulorum   55.15918940805446
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbé in a monk s dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages   12.95510847562474
and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning   117.58620136563337
from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash   68.5356798761212
a sign from grimaud put him on the alert   116.44563478581105
but there is one thing i wish to know   86.65102331914912
noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection while the assassin is not ignorant for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison   56.320135168432486
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy   157.07983111272557
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated   67.13500308340463
from that moment he grew very guarded   84.17516273478998
0133m sire i listen said de blacas biting his nails with impatience   113.4341008247684
let go the bowlin s haul the brace lower the top gallant sails haul out the reef tackles on the yards   127.12562088608283
oh whatever may be m   96.44222831530062
but on the contrary sad as death   192.52080312530816
i have returned guitant   0.20220377905343412
yes yes madame   84.96640574551353
having kings and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct   126.75200268217883
now at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused   18.059780163980506
he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure   115.42874893045705
athos and aramis followed him   11.57204259577351
do not be alarmed m   104.21614128846987
if not her husband he is unquestionably her lover   89.6834257312357
follow me then said the abbé as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès   44.48638214542734
ah   124.04084260742354
there was one lying on the table   73.50664509570488
that s well said d artagnan   45.37395616538477
one can hide nothing from you answered d artagnan   40.47437980579329
really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse   82.89366681882012
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac patience   206.33311003522635
turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium   102.91498219732671
that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument   49.76099782823003
cried the monk   185.34621029409718
unfortunately i have just breakfasted   48.985194157507365
lord   184.340347585041
empty your pockets said he   237.0899685210477
the knife was bent against it   172.7541053947074
he had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since   190.7094064717957
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word   142.73846763437396
rochefort passed at a gallop   110.98039444832769
god alone knows what country will see me die   80.49996219197799
i do not see what you have in your hand said selim   85.63271634944188
i have no one   154.9548264945361
7 dr   58.56908510235365
why you see he did not expect to see dantès return so suddenly he thought he was dead perhaps   129.18202383734643
there was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither mme   86.3095202788698
he threw his arms around her neck   74.14871122868276
one now and then i don t say much about   190.24061134143253
meet him at your own house and elsewhere   116.1103188064379
soon said haydée we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake   33.21533090442435
but i wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creature the more so as you tell me this d artagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor   77.32364862645795
had he lived mercédès perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity   172.90484424518226
oh yes said she smiling but we won t tell him   90.76645820009992
that s wise not for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the master for the masters we may say   181.53170537124532
and the commencement of the reign of king louis xiv   75.57239578032842
i tell you valentine s life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of m   93.05289765441718
valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate   114.0372267642544
la ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat   214.43972546543853
oh oh   90.66986957407855
my father my father   156.50465777554774
it was a dark night   139.11311741914545
and now said la ramee i must ask your highness s pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure   81.09522097544044
i will accompany you a portion of the way said athos   101.22655577405312
yes   146.67698862062835
what do you mean by tetragones   135.92111554745094
to go and fetch monsieur laporte the queen s valet de chambre   102.60584930892654
the lemonade morrel was in fact very happy   141.2114029039655
well said franz to him   24.503453488351226
amen   71.94262048808287
yes   119.88296983235935
since the death of little edward a great change had taken place in monte cristo   184.63967871445715
how do i know   82.40232731363747
it was one o clock in the morning   131.4471924753589
ah for the sake of our child let me live   131.9686930082146
but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt   132.47238369745452
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear   57.73800632259878
but address yourself to the keeper of the seals   163.72013803163597
d artagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeer s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it   98.54316119210466
and passes his time   165.30826327260309
bonacieux shuddering   53.7565330230253
my lord said d artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time   94.24180052260907
i have known a man much more unfortunate than you morrel   168.094431915055
yes said cromwell but the lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished   69.38612621032414
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat   121.49831243964294
hush   164.46462918965244
i do not know   118.9453471988437
it really seems to me very curious   261.63517366150404
morrel seized the count s hand and kissed it   33.79058581438085
and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it is   139.40377262934237
and what is your business   42.0763472070974
i fight in the cause of honor   132.69825255636303
they had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the king s arrival   70.20826403590046
d artagnan admired mazarin s gracious manner   143.7542103812135
see what they have done   34.29927933977646
are you well fed   58.214911236061276
replied the steward   154.71394964099008
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string   185.16977685860712
probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day   123.58493474839277
athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled   115.47464610723213
i believe i can guess at least   138.7152954962841
simply an acquaintance sir   156.88922244541558
cried monte cristo   97.4301180414861
and what message shall i convey to the baroness   32.911028896492326
petition the minister   228.0324480152201
and to complete the whole haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers   164.27426407415732
what do you wish to say about it   166.7112468427105
my dear count said he i fear one thing and that is that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna   51.000791989943735
who sent you   43.40503693568277
i hope so   23.89102209779648
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands   85.1684856954756
chapter 81   101.4339186264674
he found beauchamp pacing the room   152.98751778640352
but why has he waited till now   177.5252440348401
asked athos   140.7592617111817
the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated i should hesitate   163.71280440687426
franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window   139.01160163403028
you can say you were needlessly alarmed   156.15964887914575
we were merely joking   227.96534078680185
we can dispose of the business if we please in an hour for i have received a letter from m   189.54634990588895
the next morning d artagnan ran to find athos   169.02091710920055
said the president stupefied and without noticing the agitation which spread over the face of m   137.15859230945534
said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to milady   45.44912953608818
when m   82.02031139199616
at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debray s apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions   161.79868002670412
then for the odd cash making i think about 110 000 francs here is a check upon my banker who not being m   86.60302715428617
asked his lordship   166.81839858001402
partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow i eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution   82.91746280519772
why did i survive you   81.46406817441881
my scruples do not go thus far   49.36476063990219
said the latter   186.29592855762718
now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered   58.12839970682472
adieu adieu dearest edmond   142.2674704556954
well i know of ten such men   149.54533986916834
for myself i will reconnoitre   56.05573607720373
her reputation would be lost it is true   41.482795210539095
he is in vendome where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris   222.14454935207885
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaning therefore i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting   162.95295996628494
it would be a dishonor to all the nobility   202.55110389887693
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean d artagnan upset a man   130.25874688211746
we shall be a small party only yourself my mother and i   173.64100348426075
the carriage stopped at the door of the palace   38.910999275740906
do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening   132.2590793512403
let no one move   5.068005048890285
that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine   221.7695438122626
yes your excellency   18.45507976327214
he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love   174.9893190421028
asked raoul yes that is i had it repined the gascon making believe to find it   99.62337839936947
athos smiled and opened the window   120.72414188562533
the death of buckingham was written there at full length   121.57249999670344
you are laughing at him caderousse   177.4948478922831
he saw then that he was with a poet   102.1636448187122
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition   20.161229747188287
and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude oh then ask haydée   120.97429886132662
it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa   129.62167677370732
the fit lasted two hours   55.8541811613977
put your two hands together   113.7764690135363
cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets   151.73646927827733
one may be very comfortable in a convent   100.20914120992428
d artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity   92.28388025234864
yes   135.982507119543
but you were ill and illness renders the head weak therefore you may be excused   178.15358299211826
they are coming then   185.80633111627927
porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter s skull and crushed it   123.35809066595633
i speak to you when i can catch you   142.79648635115666
said he courage   111.94489517335424
in an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals precious   144.31094211247236
the order given by mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by d artagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned athos and aramis to exercise extreme caution   95.67662962944428
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor   144.32497233031583
fie   248.42157332660094
the englishman and his companion are still here   130.2030761116717
what had taken place during this long sleep   166.00715030230015
to yours my gentlemen   69.20472513926124
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded   152.71520801547115
monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we will   212.23782259112244
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement   5.155353879598039
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged   202.01479424315184
but jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to yield   111.59150221277416
like shakespeare s polonius he died for another   16.70178000471462
well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things   138.24045586159087
he tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins   105.43618400741717
i will answer for nothing   75.45930262530123
he flew from the apartment and morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door   100.27479947054755
it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it   39.42324119665044
well what is it what is going on here   103.06924547824124
there said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings   194.6751046698388
the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort de bouillon and d elbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted   47.508118169956376
in the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen walking   127.02657987616725
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free   150.44214484922608
by its influence time has no longer measure space has no longer distance   100.01237499384601
marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity   103.48417107047695
in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening   124.11855742680753
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down   167.50409155476532
so that now it is no longer hatred but vengeance   134.34099894753703
the thing is impossible   133.92435025971292
who told you we were intimate maximilian   180.3886032075646
those two men were the count de rochefort and the mendicant of saint eustache   162.59365601103042
and teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waist girdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain   193.73193183324585
de tréville on receiving it assured him that by two o clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers   220.27091799171228
what mother   14.902593735019352
you too have been in england sir   92.84199031165434
i reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune i resolved that benedetto should accompany me   233.62764408510887
franz d épinay said the count   70.66995909833717
it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d armilly of whom he had heard much   17.428388965086498
pardon for what   24.483528905160114
and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him   100.55418303020956
asked beauchamp   147.6374125493287
and what crime has he committed   105.96197381182324
de villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfather s is   45.983632596492555
but we were not captured by fair means   68.58577662837041
was he in the wars   140.2514250317147
if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again   150.09812840496033
the suicide chapter 93   133.80437946288203
i took the precaution to half empty the carafe in order that my suspicions might not be noticed   134.7457585127575
that s his province   194.14570270736758
be clear short and precise   119.40709826994909
doctor do you hear them call for help   176.4962364807107
the man took his way toward the city   126.180229858603
did he reflect before he insulted my father   98.99531573757234
yes but in exchange said porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange i have torn many skins   91.16458340234246
d artagnan and not to m   34.24267503194697
then said monte cristo here are 200 000 francs gone after hush do not mention these things said danglars   168.85142241023814
first speak   170.64569930963017
you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say   129.82533935498327
the abbé d herblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii   106.0392776257813
this time i will know the assassin and will pursue him   63.872106878571195
noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of madame de villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing   171.04942352808786
you ought to know   144.16706348380455
speak if you please said mazarin   81.14566396049166
so much the worse for her if she is found   144.68401353325345
yes interposed porthos four hundred pistoles   74.45616729487301
monsieur de beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced   188.50198331237706
was he liberated then   128.96288601428455
go   198.50253312263993
we look hideous said athos   67.21333752316693
i have   205.09602174422838
ah yes i see said the cardinal   31.340878556757843
franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of temper   251.7702709246666
s blood   2.1778052565335457
there do you hear   116.69624382129156
yes but the fire ejaculated mordaunt   187.19002004584604
and signed by whom by the king   83.30385783367942
m   204.99975366382176
yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits   136.11882603717663
de villefort heard of him at marseilles and m   117.1444335214102
accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foot of which the boat waited   57.557048154121475
see what she writes to me athos said he   181.25398218519075
but since then i have not heard it mentioned   141.18345861370094
tomorrow you will be no more to me than a shadow or rather even you will no longer exist   175.39168723854945
i raised my head quickly and saw mercédès who at once shut the blind   106.20739331122448
stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here   8.000349767292917
never answered de guiche   54.23202744250304
m   179.60908284663986
but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood   199.8918614793007
cried the people with one voice   24.096638438664314
i have told my secret   201.26732699375162
and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune   79.78694431194256
the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms   20.388859092592497
but it is my lord giulio who cares about them   221.10510499285854
it is not very difficult to discover that   11.933806506219867
the devil   166.9230434291993
he has revenged himself and has done well   35.51900358138043
very well then   51.45758717140701
be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees   99.2461046219604
but suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination   63.507163054901554
i have bought enough fish of him to know his name   171.42236124853653
and you include me in the expression everyone many thanks   147.31919656415616
excellency returned bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count s laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience   108.79655624977057
and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii   52.941395973081924
muttered villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackney coach   70.98490484657549
now said the king give the word and let us start   5.880810884962372
a corridor   91.60817823724595
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have   110.13970699545312
no sir said d artagnan   142.14148699719027
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty s   152.35651511537498
said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not over   139.38753597592873
m   229.36229478131241
what do you want with me   96.74041978223126
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage   201.14923553849178
that is to say eagerly replied the wounded man who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claim that is to say i was but am no longer   101.0095551809885
cried felton   183.63800785875426
how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you   95.05125905970868
and for myself monsieur shall i saddle rustaud   32.006589352456444
it appeared very thin for the price it had cost   154.9701551603957
i went to tortoni s where as i expected i found beauchamp and château renaud   118.29563657481035
said the verger   98.90638683620962
he said   159.86864657486078
and she sprang toward gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than broussel with outstretched arms   42.275918368967126
dear d artagnan   149.59175533223745
and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue   144.20195497887403
asked the young man after a moment s pause   30.25530512542592
it was winter s   99.2582328083233
the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited   40.07306324869822
if you mean to buy any horses get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it   52.401155106054304
yes   183.17264883058652
the world excuses and notoriety ennobles you   120.48458899815066
morrel expected villefort would be dejected   153.40505781020937
then it will be tomorrow   159.86968450850256
the tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the palais royal entirely   100.69958851315127
said the young man laughing i confess it and so much more the readily my dear bonacieux as i see there is no concealing anything from you   151.8327551674413
noirtier nodded his head   42.86288988205314
the guests in the house in the rue du helder where albert had invited the count of monte cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of may to do honor to the occasion   170.3452879220528
do these belong to the cardinal   164.68352474107783

not for a time but forever   47.18988478738902
our blow has failed for to night   162.816936590644
and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away   152.5474706424995
then in a suppressed tone as if speaking to himself this is annoying continued he   122.33670505346406

porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible   165.73871508680529
ah he is a confectioner in the rue des lombards   158.32794432902386
after a wild youth he had retired into a convent there to expiate at least for some time the follies of adolescence   142.4901593684981

the stranger was about to reply   63.18418158250729
impossible madame   28.33978958131229
and porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street   58.57017319696662
but tell me how you made his acquaintance   110.15751754248811
the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince   199.4943037056842
i will undertake to divert him replied the count   89.21733984353419
poor things   140.91760244617078
at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal   57.468059683188216
really count you do nothing and have nothing like other people   116.17004127864415
holloa   130.13990437669386
exactly so said d artagnan   56.607569032797926
d artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day milady gave him a more gracious reception   93.82326168269074
the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison   131.19399232661178
murmured the king   59.869524414236984
the servant soon returned   128.7499777911075
soon the water rushes out of the scupper holes like a whale spouting the vessel gives a last groan spins round and round and disappears forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea   81.40305733901124
i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majesty s ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor   144.58644849160783
after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word   128.2632478131893
he shall receive them on returning from the mayor s20   98.63584359942952

brave young man   105.07543900302456
where are you taking me   44.903918758898385
milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet   18.400985066082995
cried the brigands   235.8224799267482
i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge   238.51308478151017

he is only two and twenty   211.78707836934083
i am older than your eminence although i possess not your wisdom   146.94098165026253
said the president   63.30998399176361
monsieur de comminges he said   220.89350058905453
drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all one s wit and cool judgment   67.38742426542152
d artagnan knew his part well   193.4024728407099
i am john francis de winter he repeated and that woman well that woman   74.24812783796173
broussel was a thing not a name   209.1816698578074

d artagnan entered after the cardinal and behind d artagnan the door was guarded   126.32180211989863
at the end of an instant s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw milady s carriage stop opposite to him   168.76566563498912
there that calash filled with roman peasants   124.95745141580984
but was it indeed remorse tell me   3.0846802235072204
if they ask it what have i to say   71.9814119381646
five hundred roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married   95.6232782040378
he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be considered   125.63002716808138
what do you desire it to be   172.01007053887355
he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint laurent and advanced to the consigne   107.97112485998682
you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what i should call becoming your accomplice   53.72503570846227
and if it be necessary that like lucretia i should sign my accusation with my blood i will sign it   38.956596714465505
we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us   84.79217266924843
but i can not leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped   114.84961510187044

these words were addressed to the countess g who had just arrived and was leaning on the arm of signor torlonia the duke s brother   102.07526618342023
but take care   83.85217995170342
the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive   50.64942822378433
my patron died   180.21966767855383
although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me   229.85790684478692
i have just received my courier from greece said danglars   168.2131961293452
albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent   96.70496319205768
for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed   135.33916283378608
the ball contains a letter   76.16501708880443
the poor fowl was thin and covered with one of those thick bristly skins through which the teeth can not penetrate with all their efforts   152.30762027920278
i saw her this morning and bade her adieu   150.73191354471274
neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it   72.26104517480672
were her fears realized   32.22571102530324
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else   122.25403759600482
a letter from charles the first   95.36301855417435
he went toward the place where he had left him   169.17280055744254
he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery   20.712292310328465
ah ah   107.81629716151474
we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome   192.09407988755868
what do you say to it aramis   244.61288958911985
a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart   163.4830658682133
assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your master s blood   135.62368870227257
willingly said maximilian   50.29385657701637
porthos was of the opinion that he should give him a good thrashing first   131.69853303242616
but one word more count   223.85355249433644
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids   133.4782321515442
i will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself   141.6405592620366
now sir said the count you are safe calm yourself   31.928776620080725

yes yes the mortuary deposition   53.8109318271245
of whom do you speak   30.689318258635964
left alone she arose   81.23495821987105
it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in paris amongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just now   15.793621908646742
for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone   119.95418462861149
of what did you make your ink   170.2939387775969

the spade perhaps   92.55954691086696
villefort became pale   186.53126415685972
then said mazarin taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already shown d artagnan take this dispatch and carry it to england   235.28392806265254
they entered   123.87520578610852
two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth   29.076946173373088
come tell me his name   50.9177792481547
and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword   62.38109547162115
you have the means then of touching him   210.42694285801065
said the major with a sigh   123.76520745558753
he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal   0.71731200553603
well said milady in a trembling voice why do you not enter   86.10380582685613
once outside the city d artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood   117.66468699740108
ah my dear sir   88.27657713111145
detach the diamonds and sell them to some jew   9.849641336513912
oh as to that i can speak positively your eminence   16.03151266400998
yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the baroness   127.91569879699342
it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself   216.66103756023722
but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover   120.4825450903026
raoul said athos   66.10493388581936

ah   179.41633301195378
no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians   223.5364851718462
oh your pardon   154.85783026312532
only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count   130.7013290420435
the daughter of henry iv   5.631617347148705
the boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cable s length of shore   110.46898309392861
i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years   107.71941743490504
you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you   33.46227955695825
be easy   125.7540664633537
pardon   103.88971260683951
he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m   140.84072274565648

place this man in the care of his guards again and let him wait till i send for him   59.17958505971094
the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts   24.088129193172833
what is this rent   153.60293586655092
and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others   124.56071071850938
my father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in london   245.98451109839704
the night was extremely dark   121.51317083716319
but it was locked maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the glass   154.4332552615434
at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it   76.73879460166843
the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster   153.22343724021297
monte cristo had seen enough   132.50567966901434
there was a moment s silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome sir   167.6184460920457
a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to m   47.42004294450864
the countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath   188.37319518498182
andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing room   115.47832390512404
morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation and in noirtier s name gave that order   185.7068788971538
my vocation commands me   98.8797728425519
thy death for my brother s   21.26055010594031
but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me   99.76249468175641
and having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment he placed the others in the ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a talisman   63.533885562903244
and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that   126.74215241083527
1   10.569572150631714
then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me   94.19129684894935
and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again   177.16641635577918
ha   76.17036781828406
the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in   190.75059524805658
then you no longer love me   19.749850078571072
pshaw   166.83101838879972
this will teach you said d artagnan to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous fashion   9.231730122390914
furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy he became warm and began to make mistakes   148.61316561246136
d artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable   102.07607878733818
why did you so awkwardly let it fall   153.46306797944032
with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages like black fantastic dust   204.26183235684329
the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered   12.2143707707355
without you   176.65609059652584
no one could guess what the dirty rag could be   148.46750340990002
d artagnan crossed the quays went out by the gate of la conférence and followed the road much more beautiful then than it is now which leads to st   93.81194564083754
said athos   46.33149250252201
for you have here at least three men who will not betray you   228.89001696309109
for what   94.334810203405
and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment   88.80060464052099
is he not your friend   42.01234989543988
he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that monsieur mordaunt   176.65360558945918
asked d artagnan   112.89941746001851
yes i know him very well   13.10259970913917
but after his bath   125.88130147824957
well within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share   195.00204590316588
but i doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation defective   49.424469885266205
i have heard speak of a mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question   47.623945114234246
why what would you have more   54.69631118303934
i want to learn   113.63458289526905
she was also one of the greatest beauties at court   34.18437007396925
was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profound passions which anne of austria inspired in those who approached her   119.66431029091044
i am as poor as job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes i don t believe you would find a hundred pistoles   229.57424017553123
don t imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner   62.30654033304185
to be sure i remember it all now   99.86106677039761
then he must be a wonder   151.53759892045008
notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna he slid down like peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his feet   17.057035547783016
m   94.2304101144633
well then hearken to me   98.34066941902763
i gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount i showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future   87.24406275121778
porthos uttered a deep groan   157.20207072645547
it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light   143.14414462579145
the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt   159.66147282012426
if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve   38.78152854746014
germain   153.8769151793755
did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter   62.53078615601307
but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other   106.20606007448879
this desperate resistance could not last long   92.37009250196347
i set out three days ago passing miraculously through the puritan army and i took post horses with my servant tony   76.78747198379898
they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent   69.55421680457545
since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cæsar wills that you die   52.86416297499251
the queen had at first positively refused   18.59155851692661
speak gentlemen speak i am listening   158.3459150956448
what a confounded long time this first act lasts   112.94809412130014
as i entered nîmes i literally waded in blood   94.00886151928302
this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied dantès and to you only   298.829025685054
to the world and to his servants danglars assumed the character of the good natured man and the indulgent father   96.22760428816048
or rather i will go for him myself   165.1589089374185
cried he briskly   122.71368681198054
those casks which i took for casks of port wine are filled with powder   216.7396702584607
de château renaud asked beauchamp how is morrel   132.90052890620743
what are my commands   95.00012102932155
madame de villefort started   110.78403548142762
besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion   96.50624635304084
in ten minutes the masters slept   8.340054906932338
i will not dishonor you since that would be dishonor to myself   278.2714902733134
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms   152.17339466678925
your name   184.19853460289232
i shall meet with a victim   132.66904399677583
aramis   100.67008805630601
he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the rest   9.384906006551446
upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador   121.16499593931643
do you take me for half a woman   83.40002593956439
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening   106.68076906199326
the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd   43.23347096984554
besides d artagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits   22.451836290111572
has the host told you nothing then   39.06952413179745
her glassy eyes had no longer their sight   188.03627246321645
still you have thought of it   155.9973542654268
chevalier   122.34178200793545
but they have corresponded   133.48014963830926
and i said m   66.4137967108901
and my counsel to you nay my prayer is to retain his friendship   90.26691897455201
said the count   111.85881898908934
if he seemed very amorous   186.53892499826765
it is your place to seek the assassin   196.72812346641922
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newton s system   173.18203477946054
of certain expenses he has contracted   128.59823976873267
at this rather impertinent order peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt   76.8278154956532
which of the two denounced him   109.45211307137046
asked franz somewhat incredulously   68.51701248329779
he knew what were the rights of the great land owners   174.57129572387444
upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us   119.76945761620918
then suddenly bursting into laughter ah   190.39505423956916
inquired franz   173.32883910337625
the squares were broken to shivers   115.83277736229131
jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice   126.74393745944509
you are going to know me   35.02905037806778
de wardes   20.716605145100516
said porthos   99.68435210843063
andrea cavalcanti s solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration   81.92244561473454
de tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor béarnese   175.29238517597585
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines god knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc d angoulême themselves watched over by the cardinal an inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days   45.93913854415371
albert reflected   111.71517932746404
my lord replied the messenger i wish to speak to your eminence in secret   177.7419440532855
monte cristo perceived that the young man had turned around   117.07244565990794
this oath was no longer a vain menace   136.80715941504042
the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when d artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in a choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing   148.35144564471747
let them answered d artagnan   98.11408237928617
d artagnan was a physiognomist   177.77060386989086
count said he i thank you for your hospitality which i would gladly have enjoyed longer   123.02644527570813
that is true said his antagonists   153.1822139392971
said the man   64.63055520154364
no indeed replied madame de villefort   117.75267329226827
you are still at the hôtel des princes   116.13876669915176
the reader may ask how came planchet here   122.21010252828596
he had found in m   177.79196831446444
half a pistole if you can find out said d artagnan   116.86173724790342
as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal   32.472860094073766
i swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead   24.61138781299198
he saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity   217.59797803548264
still i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the cavalcanti   83.53041754431698
don t question me i beg of you but lend me a horse   115.50162961196531
but unfortunately the thing is impossible monsieur de tréville has forbidden it   69.82574052201004
once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest mordaunt   147.31699633574524
but is there anything impossible for my d artagnan the noble and loyal gentleman   163.48891574209046
you are right valentine   95.8346215366428
that will suit me to a dot   136.71210477358275
oh yes   275.6212065697393
but alas   168.71957207779894
he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing   139.88414277028082
in that case said d artagnan i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence   82.09036332694293
again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him   174.37572141580978
as he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye d artagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt   150.70409446083016

let us hear what it is first   135.14881719106762
morrel   45.111507358968865
and he threw himself into the arms of athos   84.44457646988559
oh by the house of fenzi one of the best in florence   56.12455404127126
i was mistaken   84.87731885027384
de tréville   98.29432561238039
oh yes   91.36809699541996
cried he   52.46525666781723
exclaimed the queen   197.57989566210688
during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp   47.208976628817794
let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment   139.27612050601036
but dantès can not remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration   154.5257628494637
are you going to leave us count   77.09233531384909
and what did the count do   208.19133324305696
alas i have only my tongue but i will try to show that it is good for something   150.31393326301014
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him   130.8154410846744
said porthos   65.8278375893245
this night i am determined to be free   42.32706486077387
come speak   87.61395237148986
three days since you were with him in normandy   179.0986924381839
i speak only of an accident you understand of a mistake but whether accident or mistake the fact is there   71.07935749463643
but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery   107.1541808643263
i invite you with good will   171.70219584338992
then she sobbed aloud   47.14657225233553
poor dear man he is innocence itself   83.7950059963967
and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of france are caused by mazarin her lover and her destroyer   101.35963552860893
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock   68.0297656700184
ah   178.35012548064506
women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms   75.61809508545043
a few seconds afterward d artagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which ill concealed the sheath of a long sword   154.88656650541253
he will amass wealth he will injure the king s revenue and pay to himself the pensions which richelieu paid to others   122.18131619542336
the two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and grimaud was posted as sentinel   84.36003118649526
none whatever   127.46836613605944
terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from paris till she reached burgundy her native place   68.82815760069822
i respect old age but i don t much like it boiled or roasted   128.02042110424853
monte cristo was at home   200.26835724337664
believe me guilty as i was oh yes i too have suffered much   104.4522967805015
before tomorrow   148.61052876344027
diavolo   124.48458329756889
he knew his time well the hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty   130.19533012162694
avast there all hands   2.024270364998216
the evidence will support it   134.90050806809757
no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinière with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure   54.489600144734716
andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale   86.35617940314675
well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with you   192.83889009717922
yes   71.26200910984156
very well   41.35851335603081
noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said   199.27287985951446
you are wrong   141.17542276523895
no one knows what there is   141.9137663965819
pardieu resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman   83.59248469146529
one thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of danglars for cavalcanti   116.48991970890393
gentlemen i have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red dovecot   145.26636328162834
said athos   101.1241744909515
presently it sounded one o clock   228.0607899493152
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking   110.01609070834002
that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his slave   38.42332630152487
the sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his sergeant   177.2347221259254
himself   94.61691732835074
i imagined it must be said morrel   183.70033492128243
his eminence is not his holiness sire   220.5060839498464
friend said d artagnan a half pistole for that paper   135.39698444259554
he is very susceptible   141.2081465434433
there were collected and piled up all albert s successive caprices hunting horns bass viols flutes a whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music   193.54949546777976
i ask pardon of your eminence said d artagnan but i was so fatigued don t ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service   50.69989702022369
and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight   111.4221891544598
no no   173.29925650070697
he was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first   169.24387710629128
the queen entered and d artagnan remained at the door   23.688456979610123
just as he was passing the count s box the door opened and monte cristo came forth   67.41079646759427
mercédès and albert were in that room   119.13468152576131
the next morning on awaking paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance   37.13706267140931
but i hear that he is ambitious and that s rather against him   101.49711807605036
i swear it by our god   52.09510347097131
they reached saint german without any accident   67.66887700296205
he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years   176.55410747760064
de château renaud exaggerates   121.90188332451513
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present   138.6422857323336
count she said you are i fear gained over to the court   146.08247767042397
ah he exclaimed here is my answer   91.33454075296355
i shall be at home till midday or if not i will leave a receipt with my steward   134.22706243743917
will this promise be fulfilled m   126.73477549112653
i wanted to speak to you   190.58948468495475
diable   143.0314023455229
the man was one of those puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around cromwell   145.21352768941156
yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for i found them ugly enough to frighten me   113.89065346903747
all at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars   51.614159286449365
he walked six or seven times round the place royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in milady s apartment which was to be seen through the blinds   198.7187530057344
d artagnan looked at porthos   164.06602595956167
thank him then madame if you have any affection for me   68.69138537823235
planchet alighted   178.06397639820693
having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps   89.64842800440877
no for venice   93.17844220036864
franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel   146.10089411001005
the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death   103.57924298988202
stop said d artagnan   61.32461766091539
matrimonial projects chapter 67   169.07541283503105
where the devil then is he   22.971825363996402
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her self possession which she had never lost   105.10803628279196
the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release   172.54099510996792
he left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial   5.798735372035921
noirtier s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villefort s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man s heart   114.63719384362963
what is death for me   65.71497895909187
it is but you will not look will you   56.25073557182086
ah   185.27683287697926
murmured valentine   150.68640031989514
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event   156.24037438712412
he is a particular friend of mine   24.616833650549182
morrel replied villefort   63.17567330964047
are we going to fight perchance   156.6839301442896
you shall not do that d artagnan said athos coolly   91.0603016646327
then he will sell them to some eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects   192.86334314523435
my life is always at your service and should i lose it i should still owe you something   166.2992972784796
save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me   110.6135395641209
you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris   164.31721207087864
they can t be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse   61.33640560205853
that s a good idea for it isn t warm   105.19986572895404
my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly   98.04850787726463
i shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions   78.96750375947786
that s true replied jacopo   178.46405921974366
well   167.17572991576057
bah it is now nearly healed and i am sure it is not that which gives you the most pain   218.4016840744697
we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives   102.9575496566563
nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty   63.39146921663338
no monsieur jester replied d artagnan   193.9340276683414
well sire for once he found his master   164.46494487610894
it is impossible   1.5780801400114939
what   125.07327302298204
i too cried mousqueton saw them also   194.07570214485196
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus   177.8512718640739
thank you   192.8888941793703
but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne   71.45668288338106
8 brucea ferruginea   52.39051801893166
the man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street   87.6877800271963
of course you stopped at your father s   87.18526074219855
i have met him i am contented   211.4691469002645
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her   84.80528903727517
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides   50.42833130863279
it was long since he had any reason for his morning s inspiration but he always slept all night long   140.20329668911975
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the ante chambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landing place have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt   194.2543926106651
and the queen   174.39129272897944
then you were going to rueil   171.6015649429415
de tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m   111.57697844689491
this promise completed poor kitty s consolation   164.89957113487523
as soon as she perceived him she cried you have promised your protection   85.14021620399973
you are a born diplomat returned franz   77.58018328393416
de tréville began to disquiet the devil   36.530125012287726
all sir   80.53397396576364
said porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face   63.350970752660686
médéah was standing at the rack eating his hay   9.031899556455201
but that s more than dislike that s ingratitude   137.81344107214204
but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished   80.52793922232365
so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left   97.44483876262572
i want the album   171.21182289411797
but villefort interrupted him   38.186719167595086
ah   17.6290889158376
still i will go   119.88099327110584
inquired the other   121.99758167987103
but i have expected you to tell me   110.0676498142453
you are not exactly right m   100.40958461572072
certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said   203.64374772252336
but that ought to be visible   22.17642844444869
said anne of austria drawing herself up to her full height and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening   142.93918299186498
when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of louis xviii   54.35376394872496
said monte cristo with a searching look   170.65654114699373
so that thanks to her friend s generosity teresa was the most beautiful and the best attired peasant near rome   143.61534259415754
she flew to the windows but they were also secured   118.14113549182137
villefort suffocating pressed the doctor s arm   157.9029106881694
it is a duel then   59.48388512598964
cried milady seeing that on this point as on the other lord de winter seemed well instructed   135.5900411624094
mercédès started   205.63756540241667
and that running footman who waited at the door and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat   44.31278621462256
you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation   49.50911649704315
rochefort extended his hand to d artagnan who took it   70.79727499578294
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme   131.81275006216111
bravo   274.73961665106316
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father   147.06196578804352
two persons were coming down the stairs   183.70675957317658
it is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive them it is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married monsieur albert   59.29719971622315
my death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger   101.95798952064418
was mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen   102.60151547394169
said athos   250.69266218827283
the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers   77.29718019801993
then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught   39.62058062534328
but apropos you belong to the fronde do you not   126.46525796175429
an effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through   39.83880711470667
just as you please my lord   33.93684219174304
one may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband   75.31372338819767
aramis seized his knife   192.12525533285327
you have told me yourself madame that i have been drawn into a snare   124.09245478511338
but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m   45.992345487234715
you must be mad my friend said the baroness   37.91100762410386
touches upon the strange effects a half pistole may have   174.70129227149303
thank you said edmond with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven   98.23427984408545
said d artagnan to raoul you were just in time to stay my hand   151.82545628520808
is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week   129.61032204360146
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely   151.79367946428917
what else have you done   167.74312897193812
now i am convinced   136.24076483702478
and he folded her in his arms   41.04758682018996
athos started   116.92250648189567
i dare not write to his majesty   61.331773335793535
why did you give him six pistoles   56.89343232190043
a newly born infant repeated debray   222.89537781019263
you sent me a strange madman this morning   160.61224230937808
i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman that he may be at ease   80.07271149590812
what is he waiting for   110.10315484384873
i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you   120.88963768872168
he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace   71.8691804746199
but you are no longer our masters   223.86967003335775
and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret   151.70160137975745
30245m for shame   87.68121562612436
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope you re preparing a pretty trial   180.54875520105313
the cardinal referred to that man whom d artagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor broussel   89.05637983400419
kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep sigh   188.04300433622953
or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone   130.56346379332817
well said the baroness do you leave m   83.34885637557508
albert looked around him   164.00908290903772
it is true   63.17860646393576
ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me   196.90827124371322
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience   127.42436786091487
determined to put the advice of m   109.47518499791533
she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge   44.904089716176685
i am the friend of the great cardinal   76.77334614464006
d avrigny i beseech you do something for her   192.52895183359243
inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor   56.217121867475214
and where is the dear boy our little edmond   58.53252327029009
it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you   164.1372300028579
well asked he when franz had finished what do you think of that   83.14572048479971
ten minutes after one is taken the effect is produced   160.77419036417763
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear   150.21304510060688
said caderousse   62.23673349006025
asked monte cristo   111.20444595122174
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct   165.91330713526688
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father s honor   24.124025015808712
d artagnan made his way through the crowd advanced toward the host and pronounced the word forward   55.987553548165
now let us try to take our revenge   183.10348494412008
if it was not you it was your purveyor said d artagnan   108.33486198353356
and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale and then and then   98.0359252871324
these were all who were left of the little troop   39.1466217225271
but read this paper today   132.45004289283617
but the brand of france   18.446756106354087
and you are going alone   70.463270000627
it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the guard   150.28487254258687
if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity   184.11323282692683
he said to his friend   84.42943313898894
there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy   79.01318880689763
danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously   163.25172004311986
no one answered   180.5998673532369
and d artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently   175.0587782551816
she was a most atrocious woman   131.47462573466322
something connected with this story   41.200702366332195
the door immediately closed and d artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity   129.97514808345943
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed   27.674472700179024
i see they kept their promise   100.90642871921074
and you   190.81969832320536
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations   91.40559132943295
yes you   166.4768401617864
are on either side of the gate which you see there   97.50325078279336
and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour   78.52972474271945
may the devil take me if the child be not dead said porthos   51.24078759371935
and by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison   142.06927102904328
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said   99.06441050404536
the devil   27.76929679519391
d artagnan and athos took the nags of planchet and grimaud and the two lackeys started on foot carrying the saddles on their heads   40.03396514546202
this time the poor girl did not even argue with d artagnan   133.0747415831462
and as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door keeper   235.32406050137692
he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage   189.28778470364995
he cried you have your promotion and i my barony   194.62119532260158
those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms   126.37668128830379
grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river within a hundred paces of a ferry   87.20211829503596
i do not think so added château renaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly   210.0970309373203
i do not understand said danglars   34.40774105313365
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave   41.01314854102557
no your eminence   91.27638769950269
how   157.4876566486929
ma foi   82.44580098826489
that last order is useless interrupted d artagnan   127.38518223715484
and the queen at what time is it her wish to start   152.34658572638395
then advancing to the president s desk what is the form said he   193.7480838046245
we are mad with hunger and thirst   185.02321445034136
every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen   148.58073011317342
you must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or i swear you shall die by my hand   191.34844610100296
he then related the adventure of meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m   85.14294003184119
in addition to the sword there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of henry iii   170.91122608043287
true monsieur said mousqueton   136.99855646844958
andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed   167.63641054948198
on the contrary the meaning of m   249.2298263158348
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors where i know not   168.1845462377638
and see perhaps it is a happiness for you humble and powerless as i am that you have met with me for if i leave this place well i have powerful friends who after having exerted themselves on my account may also exert themselves for you   35.74737408913364
ma foi   107.45114069605111
d artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume   186.57631855746232
why it is as good as a century   77.74299558403649
d artagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him   112.65283192312471
de tréville had the right of entry at all times   220.3574621997373
but i found you proud and blood thirsty and i left you in the hands of god   31.996471910219626
while uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together violently   139.59422137560014
i will show the gentlemen the door   164.5419476319417
chapter lxx   150.49738073598056
it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to danglars to invest   120.25958261011927
we must use and not abuse said aramis sententiously   244.16932395189403
do not utter that name   145.74808300920168
as you will valentine   156.70842238904223
said i to him   12.513555141360953
which means   144.946859083394
let her be ignorant that we know her secret   26.64757197037534
throw myself in the water and strangle him   19.690051244545145
that is true replied d artagnan   71.26728717345361
my husband has five or six valises   70.8741493795061
i content myself with saying command monseigneur   102.9841151752033
it is at once cruel and unjust   121.61007495429973
is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it   175.01856351953688
woe is me   92.32621095005017
it is of no use for you to know anything about it said the young woman whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back   140.65185284198571
that makes seventy   117.67045541201281
does madame de morcerf dance   6.109727993911221
protect her for the count s voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world   113.84084007452827
0285m evening came and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck   133.22853799098067
the marquis rang a servant entered   82.20652194115715
so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home   15.502443747293341
i am all that is left to her belonging to my poor renée whom you have so soon forgotten sir   165.1176060820123
château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other   22.89732676835021
i never speak to his excellency replied the concierge   101.2156440760817
porthos i doubt if you can wear it   190.28269877407212
monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips   74.85905902978274
precisely   83.28804343826883
you know one can not change his nature he said   155.8256299614274
how strong one feels here   174.8228558454335
fernand saw this and when he learned of the old man s death he returned   109.40198812514654
or of wisdom my dear baron or of wisdom said louis xviii   229.33243319016236
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel   171.93632481040166
why prithee   171.4239393697908
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice   131.95270525421586
always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile   91.43601917121477
i shall not go   162.96993676573086
perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i say that you are very culpable   70.55152409875691
that s my room replied groslow   118.93782059497605
your hour   187.00411295350935
if i only were a a baron don t you mean   40.71789797912331
let him run on said danglars restraining the young man   61.02399085651035
chapter xl   108.88704873074444
i have given you proof of that it seems to me   172.76730468622895
he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved him   134.8407492436983
oh father do not look in that way at me   186.1592148791729
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance   117.46818803669248
but what were you to do with that woman   92.41868514064143
morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been   130.82325264182322
he will indeed give us the favor of his company   89.27669921584307
he held out both his arms while the hebrews beat their enemies and then he blessed them with his two hands   253.19875300770312
said the officer everything is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house   107.26629713828831
the gentleman who receives us   97.83553493535888
well it was that affair madame   209.25977098970102
26 a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an iron heeled one   87.89254455624686
ah depreciate other persons dinners   160.46729870031675
i await two persons and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table   207.2778768019998
not too well   112.76627589791025
as he raised his head the woman s face became visible   3.715053254890833
it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot   13.14589948253058
such was the fashion of the day   82.22691052491228
bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent   122.1446099669264
do you understand me   156.79944707960368
sir said mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in paris   154.5556021729887
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine o clock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis   87.1840583400809
i will arm him against love   128.54214420493673
the following sunday then the parisians arose with joy   167.62361284002483
a doctor   22.724697604414644
there s luck my lord   6.5369540437921785
of course replied danglars   19.39249254743453
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity   151.97336936970737
my faith monsieur he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me   91.78979193837492
when you arrived here i allowed you to enter   90.00702577483227
the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons   55.39809194194621
30151m does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m   111.34587078642508
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part   3.0789937350969296
the address to monsieur the baron danglars banker rue de la chaussée d antin   43.14883252850491
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh   92.53158342107092
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee   118.33058811894064
but not enough   125.36613131810617
to calais said d artagnan   45.33934535183354
and the result of the sitting was that the procurator s wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory   130.16447450356276
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak   257.97972122392235
i will go down   274.41668585719356
the fingers resumed the jesuit st   119.95475736903089
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages   125.67343001618102
mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that d artagnan and porthos should give place   8.296219586381767

monseigneur replied athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him monseigneur the musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys   194.16101395387756
the letter from the executioner s assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected   205.1996760218352

i have spoken to you indiscreetly about danglars   213.78728485345903
but why do you pity instead of blaming me   159.10701969240037

if such be the case my dear valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his presence   192.6154826633947
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us   162.89877000316795
it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners   56.51717157400884
d avrigny smiled sadly   175.73504439798182
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words   127.9523599998133
sure of himself convinced of his own power certain that the laws which rule other men could not reach him he went straight to the object he aimed at even were this object so elevated and so dazzling that it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated it   63.84305271762088
come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say   207.39471286970038

mademoiselle mademoiselle   95.07302410688746
i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me   5.7619273388876735

pardon me my dear friend said d artagnan i think you said pardieu   166.8014799519244
and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done   20.66227456212151
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance   67.21788383847726
had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us   128.2102240365067
well my man digging found a box or rather the iron work of a box in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant   101.75213561261322
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited   103.88119323567416

then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank   53.15950506493742
but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me   10.15044630445118
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majesty a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son   10.691688515811876
when the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ship s bulwarks   85.32355241883462
no indeed   114.22784961198002
d artagnan felt the truth of this reproach   202.72460715999426
they may tell us to open it   137.5051575359993
i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom   91.8829171120319
what do you wish sir   162.5801934711338
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal   69.59381830366794
i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice   163.8403700070311
but what if i am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death   58.9622989453599
at the end of a few minutes monsieur raised his voice and said i want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended upon   179.8439525478774
as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him   235.595553401843
very fine anne   118.1456229949087
we have nothing to fear from those who love us   127.33489483375799
the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa   136.9575317426707
in proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor   217.34990492525333
but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen   149.82846832558297
yes i will take a biscuit as you are so obliging   152.96998472346897
we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham   14.32580447991333
they were indispensable   75.83004678572422
and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen   47.54032783526267
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon   149.24080663706386

guides are useful people who will turn their hands to anything   225.33490550482645
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt   126.46268379544824
so you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very expensive   130.55989706684528
the next minute franz heard himself called by albert who made the lofty building re echo with the sound of his friend s name   196.8451585989433
inquired athos   60.92312015427357
said a loud voice   174.6010266798093
she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been branded in consequence   148.28103048399964

and she has ten or twelve days as lord de winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told her   43.68611725694794
you had your portfolio with you then   193.46252906920625
the two young persons obeyed   104.52955160656234
on quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception room   138.41361473742498
silence d herblay   42.61813470860217
and driving the coadjutor s carriage   88.74050343452528
the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison   177.33117939810145
and how much did she give you for this fine enterprise   145.14237886588728
so would i said porthos unwilling to be behind d artagnan in generosity   167.76497535182045
but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage   85.71664421356257
you will say that i keep it   65.47749975895039
aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes   65.21025092478027
then there is his son andrea a charming young man about your own age viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the parisian world aided by his father s millions   141.47159770995717
as for me i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world i am quite sure i shall recognize selim   154.67817823255928
i suffered that is all   101.15463123778568
but in losing you i lose my life   116.22673469189374
28   91.85862256998158
de tréville listened to the young man s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair   126.49734195362672
we must inform the queen   3.8932905903382675
even on the night of the prince s return some citizens bolder than the rest such as the sheriffs captains and the quartermaster went from house to house among their friends saying why do we not take the king and place him in the hotel de ville   118.9669564784974
a significant silence followed these words and as the general did not reply close the doors said the president to the door keeper   83.44407073464038
cried monte cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which morrel was raising towards heaven   167.97466001077433
our young friend will be extremely well received   209.56125793406164
i must be alone   161.81224655033637
it was in the rue des france bourgeois close to la force   91.07886791104175
monseigneur i see well that i must call grimaud   62.746226545086095
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him   48.557380762653366
to meet d artagnan with a false excuse   181.23435319497332
i believe he has not a franc in his possession   145.65083143797494
and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related   173.57257950815955
dessessart who were passing two came to the assistance of the four companions while the other ran toward the hôtel of m   188.51685359887716
a man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and looked   139.32296024221915
you were in a cloister said the executioner and you left it to ruin my brother   110.99716342476167
and what does he say   242.61838660239115

really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage   255.76287679591408
get on   82.25763265482425
d artagnan it is for you to accuse her first   83.02626903878708
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his watch   135.78938711895918
that is true said porthos and he spurred his courser on   175.2200074777579
caderousse who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his arm tried to draw back then clasping his hands and raising them with a desperate effort oh my god my god   226.45892654354247
say on   197.47930253628715
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles   149.45529811902645
but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work   157.43584125302507
athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first   157.70266155685707
yes   122.11801444940677
oh what larks   6.7257221633527
said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth something   185.17416500306473
said the pilot in bad french   130.53280535690982
and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle i might have done so from monte pincio   184.8754796790867
but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger   177.32415534083975
why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once   153.95343380557904
and i too added aramis   90.8339101488398
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest   44.034994778143016
you say so with an accent stay you shall be convinced   47.497430145768575
at the foot of the cardinal s gallows   169.97624679178062
bravo planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master i will promise you a place in my service   30.224774042983555
give me some water and ether   138.0888186287657
poor humanity   47.817631681882446
monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak   85.15166706220344
he stepped forward and touching the young man s shoulder said i was looking for you my friend   90.03351887705084
i am about perhaps to discover something here   222.03892679501564
yes   197.30071423592773
dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles   185.0825964858362
so you suppose i have need of an escort   144.94635127382784
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach then the coachman s voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows   80.30738218620533
thought edmond   188.82559790547907
but she knew athos   28.115646104099767
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn   95.62070991676333
from time to time i hear of them indirectly but in what part of the world they are devil take me if i know no on my honor i have not a friend in the world but you rochefort   57.789375884499435
caderousse was thoughtful for a moment   161.17003165704745
but the precaution was too late d artagnan had already recognized mme   38.18567500588857
it was seven o clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place   27.956840811166586
and since you ask for my prisoners i bend sir to your wishes   114.24063225318244
every man that s born must fulfil his destiny   111.42972384462033
what is that   28.820020895925836
madame de villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them   112.3906842261131
you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there   92.96427781566332
the prisoner did not wish to lose time   60.441104101516565
and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves   62.321535996601035
it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of athos murmuring he is avenged   89.7652062283943
he will never see you again   70.20554380387745
there happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of people   218.03310808940032
valentine the night light continued to burn on the chimney piece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water   34.42883099246464
if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king   26.732137964760767
just so   225.25630947813684
therefore with the puritans we must go   122.40892409087716
he came to demand five millions at once which i paid him with checks on the bank   197.00243357603995
in his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them   144.81050058250207
it is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you   141.04643201851155
de tréville   63.283264566977145
but at a tremendous discount of course   112.94147803766784
they were making nearly ten knots an hour   89.19072737306827
she loved porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus   130.13481942412946
de morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it nothing could be in better taste than my father s demeanor madame said albert   209.4843297984221
yes my lord answered the man   200.26044514040706
at this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of raphael s picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object   64.11974966873666
thus illumined aramis read the following epistle my dear d herblay i learned from d artagnan who has embraced me on the part of the comte de la fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months   106.4980656349318
i can scarcely realize so great a happiness   144.00695701113509
on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglers but for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend   202.47981319980588
m   181.85106203304696
why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine   196.0856118990183
said athos   48.23277525833166
how dear sister   178.4328870938839
friend mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of supplies   176.70028066789152
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www   12.547423961763059
gently gently said the old man with a smile   50.428622056498
this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey   122.64320371654549
and now leave me monsieur bertuccio to walk alone here in the garden   73.32038406028401
and who has punished her   95.8833715578738
that is why valentine passed through her room which was on a level with valentine s and only separated from it by edward s   46.35084517632943
but as you spoke to him you must have seen him   178.93995267696505
this manner of acting roused much respect for d artagnan s policy among the musketeers   57.06905186670867
at eleven o clock albert had not come back   74.92810613380905
you are then angry with us   252.80789348521742
i have none and am obliged to prepare my own meals   144.13237581611867
great is truth muttered the count fire can not burn nor water drown it   119.83440446721131
ah   124.30643543646978
very well   48.98908272842593
then no misfortune has happened to you   146.1697038161436
i am not up there i know but i have only just come down   161.48930733952693
but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top   166.9157664370148
d artagnan said athos this is no joke i trust   109.03137336153932
my sister is five and twenty my brother in law is thirty they are gay young and happy   157.63870049463873
when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil   221.65293777992366
what day do you fix   35.931023650440224
the château d if   134.4605477338722
observed franz   187.93670458702
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to d artagnan s deliberations   78.35886529557149
porthos was the first who came to himself   16.8752788054845
milady looked around her as if in search of something   79.75145796334209
had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven   131.33050268252597
around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach   83.7265730962065
in the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him   51.762302632141896
will your excellency deign to open it   124.21562550423494
he knows that we were sent from france by monsieur mazarin   122.66314284788821
ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy   86.0278419062262
no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises   158.37776763856672
but what happened after my departure   177.44294382300484
return whence you came   121.04213472490584
hallo fernand   7.905230350976552
then the insurrection in greece broke out and he had served in the grecian ranks   117.17021070142049
execution chapter lxvii   61.770291229179016

he is here   146.954428400776
i am twenty one years old or rather i shall be in a few days as i was born the night of the 27th of september 1817   89.42866538547388
pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors   128.95415831101823
all those he is in the habit of receiving   35.49658931041057
you had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death   150.61180101621858
but no   97.56473493010455
tis not one man not athos only not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you   47.79441464121608
then some words were spoken by the two women   57.73912084432772
oh i am dying   121.07842471704514
one of yours   114.7916261274457
and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday d artagnan sent planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment   54.84926857639167
you are the queen   187.01058180740222
planchet called out d artagnan take care of the lackey   73.61673435519316
and on the 5th of september at eleven o clock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven i shall come to receive the money   116.22160748039109
but these two words would bring about my condemnation divorce exile   133.46663396186437
nobody saw her replied d artagnan and he related to m   164.66601474659277
ha ha ye romans   136.04333810441668
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced mme   222.20084978635765
everything believe me   110.87593407758783
here we are without occupation it seems to me   49.36114465183594
hold your tongue stupid fellow said d artagnan   112.28571616964425
but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master   154.85490108391554
one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak   85.87430110002066
he is dead sir   30.53178303876119
true   127.61956890983349
30059m dear valentine   49.76239282957904
instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood   136.69813714981302
no pity for him who had no pity   229.1960750729333
he cried by jove   30.911261504848355
besides said athos waiting till d artagnan who went to thank monsieur de tréville had shut the door besides there is that beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend   179.52837316608986
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost   113.07244687848348
the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz   44.65104138767941
is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month   100.51605345588635
speak   56.42628499605135
asked blaisois   25.30251073707032
come then and take it friend said the gascon   54.86755685088586
but he thought of his oath and he would not break it   136.58594357856194
bertuccio   121.59021990871965
instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment instead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors instead of the court filled with bales of goods re echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom   146.2814266835703
he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening said the other   136.2680498095553
well here are 8 000 francs on account   72.14994461956084
pray tell me the whole story   75.67378149226167
i think not monsieur unless something new should happen   82.94370534843856
a customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded   80.87107634897914
but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again   183.75046444447682
chapter lvi   128.2055692971483
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after you   150.61395302620568
monseigneur will be with him in an hour   80.34454642993623
m   123.42673521722757
and me also said porthos   69.73453126955192
if the musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed   161.4226603027227
ten minutes afterward she was at home   64.1236724815312
a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile   257.0013590670335
the bonnes fortunes of de tréville were talked of as those of m   16.864393282239575
yesterday for two hours i was at the church of saint philippe du roule and for two hours i prayed most fervently   203.24227658012938
she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies   215.80132171077946
i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant   192.81666549122713
the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind   209.57976811696795

rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught all these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo de medici   69.5669489558164
edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couch he did not wish to die   111.67509931332388
he resumed   44.643510192707026
why not   100.40445531668843
to what class of society does he belong   179.86012947244328

well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess   115.5530340664664
he turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the party called the fronde whilst mazarin returned in a pensive mood toward the palais royal   140.6480367718171
you would cross your catalan knife with his dirk   116.25314831661308
jesus seigneur   142.3185306147657
in fact said mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed   80.44008312777466
but d artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished   131.7341405778501
stormed   61.92458432180749
now i recollect said the afflicted old father   140.93623331849042
of that spark i will make a flame that shall devour him   223.0805633743825

barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him   153.6630630669429
when he compared the public crimes of this minister startling crimes european crimes if so we may say with the private and unknown crimes with which milady had charged him felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life   162.98256549621763
dantès made no reply   23.57726673736363
only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the musketeers   78.9338466407057
ah it is jacopo she said the captain of the yacht   160.05931355473018

cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance   140.33157221057712
it is so   136.87722984731155
my good my brave guitant whatsoever command i may give you in that language in french whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it   193.91105065973784

to london   137.36139977155614
the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically   82.14623212184544
besides his horse he found had a carbine on the bow of the saddle   150.16215449860138
yes that you sent me   131.76858503420937

but tell the duke himself who can not find anything what the report contains give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet   54.75171447652062
coquenard after the luxuries of such a repast which he called an excess felt the want of a siesta   152.9531921280619
between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots   71.97855751639099
i hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our music paper   183.88594529540404
oh yes it is you indeed   147.85701350888783
at these words the public attention became more intense and all eyes were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to enter   84.61958721701924
yes   160.03972683329852
at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore and holding a spy glass in his hand   88.62695758400332

two men jealous of him sir   0.6538119668819036
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living   229.80481523803746
danglars bit his lips   7.813506626335794
which is the young man   40.78477371139725
although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair i will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you   254.5591490407797
the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance   116.8462761634901
said i   77.81769002484052
my brother s carriage will be here first   80.02007548633205
but felton did not come   245.70693923980699
pardon me d artagnan he said   152.42868029282533
he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable oh   85.45624532128127
the two men turned round and saw morrel standing at the door pale and terror stricken   175.85294846842243
since it is opened i will take advantage of it to enter your room   112.59809351832946
that is your road excellency and now you can not again mistake   88.48207529057655
said athos to himself is it indeed possible that i hear what i hear and that i see what i see   22.400993068434147
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather   108.52349348051703
at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion   91.32367664761726
how so   96.36631468251318
d artagnan s arm dropped to his side   56.60778451962552
i have often read and read again the history of mithridates said madame de villefort in a tone of reflection and had always considered it a fable   95.56333066187881
we expect him every moment   147.9555831951548
athos killed his adversary first   113.05219551685289
what m   2.3861562648437484
what is your name   62.691987532227266
my plan   159.13512939402628
40227m the stranger cast one look around her to be certain that they were quite alone   39.71915788759861
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats   167.3139853987578
this man has often made me shudder   203.91779789680027
no nonsense my good fellow   68.40887090197003
they can take place at rueil   39.29917059090107
at the court which raoul had never seen   197.29020960223409
how dare you tear out the drawings   143.4831715357108
i make no secret of it   53.06049909006987
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost   145.12864551702359
what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and i have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servant that s all   103.30985249488526
the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by la ramee and the guard   68.84366915776515
no   106.79746822206116
yes cried milady but i shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life i shall lose my honor felton   174.22987286763598
athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat   136.33602565878067
said aramis   100.35781902557115
skirmishing   163.3018655293668
after ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten   169.54298243200697
long live de beaufort   8.069727093277507
because they fought against me   137.64699752229703
he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower   179.8219481951324
said monte cristo   255.18415700417748
cried d artagnan looking at his friend with an air of doubt   223.71998834312092
you are not willing that i should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul   174.6636962828837
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach house   208.8587854010661
it is but christian charity replied d artagnan not to lead one s neighbors into temptation   62.00471300491767
baptistin entered and remained standing at the door   129.86004106370888
but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition   163.96656820933825
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol   48.713734562945376
ah that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess   33.671058227279204
is this the man   41.434410442690606
no drowsiness   163.93643756877466
since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto   64.37359343610687
as easily found as the cart   69.82097804648501
at the same time the door was opened   58.99250076303155
1   116.61189670376207
oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god   111.7491826268515
now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself   123.8611560719207
aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow   142.56634965087568
oh yes him   123.62693362554843
that letter is not yet gone   148.3110129423818
alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it   44.73837657724329
the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the palais royal   99.43201529016453
major cavalcanti chapter 56   107.95089894017012
i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed   137.45563387937668
m   154.2608201934525
yes i will tell you all   153.2207370628232
she slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first hope   231.88012784568568
the door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind him   212.49694285424494
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain   130.4924590630745
at london you may tear off the outer envelope   212.5127868022318
de tréville loved incense as well as a king or even a cardinal   144.0558775026258
true said monte cristo   99.37309141839685
the door closed   174.18994609011995
asked baptistin   127.12994507041465
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast   25.6268228463711
then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to you   13.700061268325982
silence said felton i hear footsteps   117.74728444723182
our boat is waiting for us there   20.573724226640536
in one second athos joined him   123.34922618621468
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund   73.05702529978358
even to his horse monsieur   109.77386248609699
morrel can you intend it in my house under my very eyes   91.18470181281171
buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and avenge himself for that little treachery   171.39015898574806
dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the château d if   100.99928690745907
you may be above others but above you there is god   122.48583077589038
they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe   189.69556632858803
cried the gascon you would make a distinguished general   60.10068241881436
not on your own account surely replied monte cristo   78.41426784633894
you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest   197.0720550725836
well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone   147.0158984926473
have you neglected to obtain information on that point   92.89437946718415
i will come at once to the point   182.50300961410775
how can i tell   146.5397609654417
upon fifty soldiers   77.38693519200274
as to his going or staying i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions   175.84274526947874
you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon   115.85331143781072
chapter lxxxiv   133.82056808356316
how not agreed about   170.78482061555368
there were also less agreeable visits for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated   157.84209134712705
i know it is very bitter said valentine   112.05639732275651
in what manner could these events concern you   58.25348768876454
the story will be very long excellency   54.35642306699275
doctor cried villefort alas doctor how often has man s justice been deceived by those fatal words   38.61642260650048
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day   204.32886931318916
if you take one step farther d artagnan said he we shall cross swords together   114.62086193791234
how madame   59.49736038824045
did he mention my name   129.43409678840226
someone must be sent to the duke   19.095302329202042
30289m are you at variance with the englishman   101.12859597083498
what were you doing on that armchair   12.699039736584922
the viscount of morcerf can only wed a marchioness   196.16821930001845
said milady   100.49783268718839
he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game   219.64297493849313
bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead   124.72332052366669
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy   100.53025319469853
she believed the order ready for execution   32.93799987418336
unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad   82.90477458018526
murmured d artagnan   110.50692167733159
cried porthos as if in pain   57.82188030527166
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow   133.28264011681125
you have no longer a weapon   71.99958918721238
this was a terrible moment for the fugitives   100.7592760428089
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m   107.79543361139578
said monte cristo   96.01270301560399
so much the better   232.91782132267207
he is a coward   60.84995119039695
how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble   114.25011141107021
bartholomew in 1572   178.79310540788038
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s   118.83777144308725
if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands   156.52159517576715
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars   23.312784597812225
we will send my brother s servant back to béthune whom as i told you we can trust   29.067505407036535
now to the work i have in hand   146.77485129911884
at two and twenty one calls every man one s friend   61.53140740141143
at dinnertime we will rouse you   107.34264521101794
coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by mme   20.76964539916844
when the procession reached the palace loud cries of long live their majesties   94.87823594651144
a plague on t   59.25426539829499
it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the garden hedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence   29.927391829674406
andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no   111.18711238277876
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action   152.33144141180756
from this moment i become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs i ought to occupy myself in yours   102.28723513154458
i will do it captain   137.0910713554134
i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter   60.352964764100086
indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy   191.01207457010014
but this letter in which he recommends you to me   75.64092149967493
cried felton he again he always he   199.46528457766954
it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provençal kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves   171.6527429221382
porthos ran to him   130.00401404245014
de motteville will not be astonished at this reply   217.11420304044663
she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arms stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless   110.15985210807769
i am happy to see m   68.64739116557259

maximilian morrel captain of spahis   87.26676564507011
ah it is you peppino said the count   111.64822705770949
so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne   119.27429298840443
with me   44.403730147346295
do you think of dying my lord   86.42245857198778
so am i delighted to see you said d artagnan although i am not yet sure that it is aramis i am speaking to   146.37804392736072
and it was this young man who brought the monk to you   133.11831032461458
she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was d artagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you   43.96115088177234
it seems to me said the host that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur   171.91022273809043
yes that is true   87.0373563477894
sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer d artagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond   153.01742737615686
he examined the register and found the following note concerning him edmond dantès violent bonapartist   215.75562849738935
he asked coldly   184.68028125187743
it will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the englishman   110.88456286103383
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand   103.57928145114148
now you are rich said monte cristo   90.20515318171775
danglars retreated a few steps   139.45477341367456
these cries had something so heartrending in them that m   54.219593507148026
i answer for his consent   113.68318338297351
asked the captain   173.38331468091405
the doctor without shaking hands with villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household   138.53128154066266
well   253.50318492933243
porthos looked at d artagnan with an expression of profound admiration   157.81988665617294
in that case they have eaten everything   197.3333204021579
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write   136.8229767674809
the ferry across the oise   36.78138568172132
i will call salvieux and make him write the letter   43.01544811334567
and to you also m   157.55357697094414
patience   164.77542459877137
i am very anxious to see this man   178.28294252551714
no truly   147.115917713269
and as a commencement they were to sup together   119.0401226239114
let us leave to night we have nothing more to do here   149.99194102445563
i will mention one to you   38.951515902816595
you ministers give such splendid ones   116.17380050207431
grief had made her blind to all but one object that was edmond   288.4559114669222
there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night but it has been taken to the house at auteuil to that you went to you know   39.50770235274089
no   41.36680251146903
ah   103.68782162129664
i will tell you mr   208.5482299112785
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say   71.19241990278493
no replied athos   222.30590458425007
four men prepared to do so   160.3836964106495
but i must write   109.6667724487972
milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone   3.3045005972015105
comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post   86.46172595893803
and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts   159.13315686873912
possibly nothing at all   37.28599673511904
i have brought her here sir and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold well water   90.60077558885115
danglars turned to the left   153.58970845489557
the young man remained immovable   11.217613419587877
you know well that i don t like to leave things half finished   65.077296400334
said d artagnan   104.12268201684489
we live in times when there is much to which we must submit   100.20878249584241
oh dearest marie   142.0796868019714
he has put out the lamp i can see nothing now   137.44057989229333
everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel   90.24754382353936
it arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saws   109.75350375514292
madame my friend du vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire   108.11030301533178
not the least in the world replied bonacieux   90.01325670320949
they are your compatriots   166.46757391439888
he was an italian and therefore superstitious   83.07505535099403
weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly   105.58124496831095
it is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man   59.96616406998905
said grimaud   97.2795418990116
ah ah   43.47728619347103
you will be assassinated   84.0309412245325
since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it   106.12789862038497
and the ill treated people have drawn up the following which i have the honor to present to your majesty   144.56583989134845

d artagnan   82.84300903604368
yes   42.72234613221522
a door opened through which the attendant and the baron disappeared   95.70053336176834
the news caused a great sensation throughout the house   3.3126841788357098
the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs   94.7628019997664
the maréchale d ancre was no more than the maréchale d ancre   79.1069482581331
speak out my friend   101.56974576622527
a shorter clerk came behind the first a taller clerk behind the second a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third   92.5955525137282
this postscript decreased greatly the young girl s happiness   144.1496007289423
section 2   178.09701253093667
eugénie   152.41131786974495
you promised me something else   102.93468089425673
my reason   168.81941573607847
and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers   162.15463901012512
and must i tell you my lord what they wished us to cry as well   5.867034842872982
four men always supporting one another never yielding executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common   83.95813549107066
the man carried me to the foundling asylum where i was registered under the number 37   57.77219708829404
and she took two or three steps forward   73.47389395957978
imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith   185.62395739343037
pray ask me whatever questions you please   3.329523961565613
you are laughing at me and want to try me   28.92580797851538
morrel i know there was no one in fault but destiny   57.59624624369275
then listen to me   74.70835953623377
porthos was magnificent   96.85944457610199
well two words will refresh your memory   105.9188147516037
she is not dead   223.2928918904529
my letter of recommendation   138.47050065421197
good journey to him   217.3754851079776
in fact the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when fortunately night came on and enabled them to double the cape of corsica and so elude all further pursuit   193.2079462085091
it interests me very much cried d artagnan   173.96253037021083
what they should write to the clever person at tours   112.4447514431177
this cry was generally heeded   37.279644427898106
to morrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy   49.0095043024763
thanks gentlemen thanks   152.71889635456893
e   142.2641715581049
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance   121.02345297796762
yes   100.82681052708642
but the more the young woman excused herself the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him   117.15542342336188
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness   120.8155352088254
de villefort made and returned very few visits   152.99158401110122
call an officer of justice he said   59.13712822169468
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir   54.58463262189276
he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans   201.2121616152775
when one is eating ideas flow easily   159.6814129963961
wait an instant my friend and you shall be satisfied   87.73902844833225
to what end   12.511504300211783
and i thank you   136.45583258814025
and i see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy father s head   116.42876253492874
athos remained sitting   85.15675274947813
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away   111.4846389569462
it inspires me with the idea that m   147.3798125073378
come come said comminges who since d artagnan on the day of broussel s arrest had saved him from the hands of the parisians had entertained a real affection for him don t be unhappy   124.12127675628875
i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastisement   96.8294227642363
mistrust porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as god on earth will assist him in contriving mazarin s escape if mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric   119.36404891816197
and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read   99.35154073515693
your advice then   199.2211224127084
that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer   96.89405721757774
on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life   237.0378588071169
his holiness had an idea   151.92067359270413
no news had been received of them   73.24211531332261
oh   72.81923423298936
i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and i wept   72.8601748920444
the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies   72.45867074565635
exclaimed the king   168.539012310362
here is the sea   66.37696805417428
but i deal in certainties   264.56545070162423
toward eleven o clock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court   71.4854204680502
as for franz he remained at florence and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited corsica the cradle of bonaparte to visit elba the waiting place of napoleon   14.330996431857315
madame de saint méran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived   176.73514081586083
then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine   229.0889032698961
what the devil are you doing   152.77581215798477
but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother s voice when she enjoined me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given   76.17887927990643
the marquis of saint méran   173.031117295472
and what is your opinion   211.63550338279128
mr   137.6347905479654
i congratulate you   186.8996604088209
25 in the rue de vaugirard   156.41864361452446
i have not a penny about me   118.76772817705262
said porthos   110.94619618034582
de brezé who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire   98.01993419184467
but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw   131.08821550694893
all right since you will have it so   106.1892080863034
but he could not yet see under this veil   120.61142485292169
they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m   88.60711052217651
behind a glass window by the light of the cardinal s lantern which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the castle of rueil in long lines forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys   129.96542269403477
i misunderstood you   66.56240041388429
at length the light disappeared   109.2601620506504
then murmured louis he was well informed   128.9742804644789
i obeyed my love   233.85648163642406
ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married   31.811641364385892
dantès seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair   9.258683823635891
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having poisoned constance bonacieux who died yesterday evening   122.10309706417345
we must seize the felucca said aramis   176.74055861741158
it is his way and you must take him as you find him   191.3967065238776
then i must wait   68.43717488361033
tell us about it said athos palpitating   172.71393526528584
yes   54.99131602552245
de boville despairingly   119.62386246172524
there is the little door opening into the garden   122.81600454613677
the duke counted two stories   164.0199435778011
it was many years since d artagnan had opened his heart to any one   146.52752072479365
both resumed their way   155.8768759543537
mousqueton s horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his companions   113.57716331255514
madame replied athos i have only to ask your majesty s prayers   165.32112141610924
if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow   135.2651192199892
exclaimed mazarin piteously   41.220677023439436
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand   142.96019969351957
chapter xxix   31.385508843631953
yes monsieur   54.70067219920674
listen said she   31.619472579410257
what is life to you   182.83240212428677
i swear it was time for you to come back la ramee and i was eager to see you again   188.98845521970253
and i was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water   94.34121323779209
in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other   114.8763681924458
it is a way i have of speaking to myself   176.85754946955058
but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple   62.95823242418716
the daughter of ali pasha   146.33754009505333
it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of   160.19200414563235
and that will not be long it is to be hoped said porthos   160.35557574194567
the guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from fort louis and fort neuf   158.7057667781815
d artagnan pressed raoul s hand   70.60930909846383
go then and set about this work in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance   60.57027120412135
and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin   187.5288073742001
and if i may without impertinence ask where are you going   82.40573750388754
have you informed him of it   46.733548114723845
of what must i repent   92.18271595761662
oh heavens   91.92915333141244
la renaudot warms his sheets   157.99710328149277
you will force the last drop of blood from your veins   195.553038680164
the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed   106.91085863132179
it would have been one language more   104.95877462615863
deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards named comminges made his appearance with his clothes all torn his face streaming with blood   153.19461140549475
how the devil do they venture so near the hotel de bouillon   167.84618522761545
that s no doubt very fine said porthos   143.23667809203215
what is now called the lower town did not then exist   196.71203011010198
ah then i suppose you heard haydée s guzla   235.05881400374608
we were quite alone   221.16824591559197
and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm   77.88319725296459
milady was livid   9.364175392612054
you would not like poor andrea to have his throat cut by albert   91.99650894399441
let me speak to her of the east   96.05188857075747
be easy monsieur said planchet   248.39909100849223
he cried throwing down his knife   80.25724608972976
felton i dare not tell you at what idea i smiled   33.728478195663214
a mournful sob burst from villefort s heart   87.65651027232411
as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him   298.3080753455075
but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed   153.97604087934698
your name   47.940684627580794
then mine is the boat you want sir   129.38109482144145
is it large   40.502108287749266
i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies and he was not among the least of them   94.38455390397205
besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart   79.43141775764329
let me do what i please and do you what i do   232.8666444205187
the bell of monte citorio which only sounds on the pope s decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal   96.49041485004138
don t you know me   89.49934591621904
in my country the ladies do without chambermaids   31.467977595126797
reflect promise to be silent and riches consideration even honor shall surround you   153.89967640162726
then you were aware of dantès being engaged in a conspiracy   177.66395865091934
what has become of him   128.97635717136396
i can not believe it murmured the banker   168.6425307419396
this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country priest   91.15599090206149
inquired d artagnan   108.68577664240604
the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of the little versailles   178.93944069856306
old dantès was dead and mercédès had disappeared   165.3525325181625
who are you   32.14950795136696
replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone   93.72187297954807
i tell you she loves another   232.63184368835317
before a woman you would dare not fly i presume   177.34996093576243
sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her   188.763126685317
they are calm as if by enchantment   150.23689133935923
sire said villefort your majesty mistakes   133.57695333644094
the count de villeroy said that he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment when the court had to defend itself against the parliament and the citizens of paris his holiness the coadjutor who by a signal could raise an army of curates church porters and vergers   124.77537776730007
dantès took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body   111.68010343927878
germain   50.795113493498974
what   129.5037875444506
the old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and dry   145.5982206262716
still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish it if you demand it why then it shall be done   79.07641397606739
and then there was a burst of brutal laughter   43.13235462723978
yours is a noble nature   10.402538366028125
and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart   221.9040610280752
sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted up   193.07688059477658
at daybreak d artagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done   15.357002431653768
at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room   109.5098475886223
my dear vicomte returned monte cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received   40.83395260477154
0259m yes sir   113.71958092998943
and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this   119.13863634799411
dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what i sabring right and left among the bedouins can have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels   124.97954564509942
m   81.09394585405173
the woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill milady   99.25625933605812
monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club   28.751238618692412
the circumstances that had hastened the return of d artagnan to paris were as follows one evening when mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices   129.4763866912428
i will stop at the first posting house said danglars to himself   92.78017928493624
e   166.11811496770258
he was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die   48.86253908582559
they told you then that m   150.6937404447084
besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say have patience   152.26557926231254
but that father was dead   133.06747223569727
the baron knows as well as myself that milady de winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation   115.16903361874674
at the first sight of his old friend danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy chair   30.4309890999547
refer to your papers   163.31737268457974
she saw d avrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night   220.82823982591086
aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed athos   123.35555390072412
lead us grimaud   15.214165948862842
stop what   200.92958325701602
de boville m   95.49666595985617
are we to pass the night in the king s room   197.9931885341544
they this time embraced heartily and without retaining any malice   77.75958673248462
your majesty is mistress said la meilleraie retreating a few steps   141.85582532580605
i can scarcely credit it   105.1366676452022
what do you decide on sir   119.33417516264151
it must be done in the palace   114.4110834148868
one seized me by the hair that is why i now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and i already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre   112.0735359525486
perfect madame as you have seen replied the count   130.13892883969055
give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and i will bring you the citizens and the parliament   205.29504658785447
tell me then   158.81927095556853
so much the better said d artagnan   70.32177424913306
that tall harsh looking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute   141.1526854881102
ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room   51.336835063774245
you will thank me for what   58.44027690717735
then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch   169.65705613802118
we should be very hard to please madam returned albert did we not think him delightful   112.6719670544489
planchet shook his head and said nothing   85.98914494509066
enough   29.588807527274383
the major s eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment   1.4650250840946057
de villefort   182.43740139984249
the cardinal s hair stood on end   60.280557289244754
true replied franz   99.4482174692985
to whom did he give up his sword   101.07604536974668
doubtless he is capricious but that is all   191.70311210638673
but perhaps they have killed him   33.92738630451004
it is i shouted a voice   35.0837250453212
faults or crimes responded monte cristo with a negligent air   48.79787168990538
but what shall you do with him   96.20156666585176
listen then   72.94069421620685
but i am here to do you justice   112.21140997707543
if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be lost   89.57359861613008
they are indeed exquisite he said   81.32524025137491
why didn t the baron come himself   106.39242031405459
it is no doubt the same said he   63.627126530313
sharpen your sword baron load your pistols and give some corn to the horses for i will answer for it something lightning like will happen ere to morrow   90.42198539399234
the window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than before   53.177846152290925
but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me   68.21994725549024
it is useless then to attempt anything with him   120.71885055133244
and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his heart   66.63312121596208
to your house dear porthos at pierrefonds   138.03192849579128
and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres   62.52280362728289
of course   137.4459406315054
they are no doubt both curious and interesting   133.06269758662148
ah yes that is another thing   156.32153295645486
it is so rare for them to leave the lions den for any other place than the barrier saint jacques the galleys   116.1420444515912
in the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard is   125.80633275998197
my friend said athos i have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary   183.4730128276708
i swear to you it is true   131.27561296783455
we have promised and we will keep our promise   50.888950785753366
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague   135.8146502984773
so beautiful   48.31980879337385
andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered   89.05606082874077
he cried   96.47070445344448
the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court   216.5182323755032
it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune   80.86589242471058
and now that i reflect about it i am glad to leave paris at this moment   103.90663186814369
if you are willing gentlemen i will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you   138.9301183702005
worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late   98.71378361852454
i have not failed to do so your reverences replied the young man returning their salutation   43.234216019828665
what is his folly   209.1735078169532
twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled   224.11227648548964
i trust all this will soon be taken away   111.6949724015376
so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling   177.1876692952188
you can not be speaking seriously athos   133.62146403069107
but now we are alone what are you going to say   64.46358820617306
have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m   269.5725023558054
what end would that answer   132.2659870740626
but to his friends to athos and aramis was apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety   138.16729060458394
what do i see down there by the wall in the direction of the catalans   150.77627054095444
the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction   101.4460190379038
now i repeat beauchamp i wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow   91.37184739399731
this appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses and finding that i could no longer be of service to anyone in the house my only desire was to fly   125.97998677505247
and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking glass   49.4779797709121
he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket   49.47059718864962
well said caderousse why don t you come   186.67085552582034
so let us speak no more of it   171.26087765914542
well sir go said louis xviii   143.76022442526147
d artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he d artagnan and his friend had rendered to the queen s party in the morning   64.3581283392341
he could already see the intendant s beaming smile change to a contortion of grief   5.261420979983498
coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to porthos and mme   162.94329652396283
needless delays but increase the grief of parting said monte cristo and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite   164.1725013142498
edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with years and can not now remind my edmond by a smile or by a look of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating   113.5175870159936
answered the voice   181.47234559188266

we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from mazarin s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes   123.20936619807702
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow   95.5668593670547
monte cristo is the name of an island and he has a family name   0.9597438288734566
d artagnan took charge of it   108.76937264951543
you must return to the rue des fossoyeurs   97.68988129666243
i heard notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet a step which made the floor creak   120.3727180125073
he means replied the man upon his return that he got in that way   99.91424934475089
no kitty you are mistaken   116.54723527703567
well oh speak speak doctor   240.3138012911765

if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat   134.62472269466525
higher much higher   110.20534387646893
let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung   119.9667004678318
ngle in the second   105.31150180682087
he wished bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of m   29.882283795203705
villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words   69.9507944993288
i was obliged to brand the guilty one   106.28299877863023
a better idea however came into her mind before going to bed   177.05241435675964
and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face   130.72585077251298
my people could tell me nothing on that head   177.5268395591793
there is none said athos   59.94579775200348
then following the clew that in the hands of the abbé faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure   123.69350786567033
and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place   132.22581917895477
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god   185.63711538238977
in truth the lieutenant s horse stumbled and fell on his knees   207.88174637217764
in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m   146.09822213482727
but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison   144.2155876740499
that s like good neighbors and we are quits   100.71051756044982
the devil   59.44112259896883
what has become of him then   135.5706671077388
workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house   46.142990118766505
the pharaon   37.89419969726798
morrel looked at the count with surprise   116.2481434590533
a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercédès   90.71571419974791
beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the french government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in italy since his paper is prohibited there   100.27000098009452
said he and shall i never succeed in overcoming the old leaven   146.8337416225972
he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed   187.02004695042473
did you never see him   73.35612994475625
yes sir i certainly committed that imprudence   111.03751317448591
oh it s nothing said d artagnan   120.60022822697984
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness   109.51056230332128
do not let me lose both my companions   169.3297679546282
and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers   78.11002920952717
he went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her   73.817320040488
this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was   53.89800512197398
well then if you obtain the reprieve   4.075613040460098
lieutenant with a promise of becoming captain   82.4493206876418
has he any friends   61.18398410045753
what is become of them   129.45074232079241
at this instant in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious and first were seen rising above the waves a wisp of hair then a pale face with open eyes yet nevertheless the eyes of death   176.6915533237558
he therefore went forward without a moment s hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half   14.921018883887399
what would the abbé please to have   117.8804042843837
the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter   84.63929401771136
yes to escort him into the capital   113.72719269123829
murmured he and that noirtier is the father of villefort i am lost   119.89803726831143
if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same   165.52420602037367
there listen   63.387259008438974
i believe i see double   73.127124751546
this was more terrible than the first   110.33245146029692
debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor   104.32394296059206
planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the place royale with two hundred men forming the rear of the army of paris and to march on charenton when necessary   102.47723974901271
meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example   105.30550717357741
you would be all the wiser said athos   91.51257829498896
the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place   92.98694377284829
as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants   16.27809820033812
it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does   7.0012647049322965
the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking   104.12111847707114
i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm   48.48152159603144
but there should be at the end of one s devotion something to gain   15.782011753198077
really monsieur you say strange things said aramis   154.27316038644722
i will be an abbé if it suits me   122.0597614455328
stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden   115.03261712772037
do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me   107.68287418065184
you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas   70.88589721099146
because you have the order of charles iii   126.59703625846075
say it then   24.354479449177376
de boville receiver general of the charities   87.0415570189863
the king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him   191.16352129393596
she will be compelled to submit   186.1337244967141
then d artagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful   57.725482841977566
i claim then the right to choose my opponent   43.854941258119524
rest content with my friendship for i say once more that is all i can promise and i will promise no more than i can bestow   149.60297793782433

pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one which may betray him who wears it   86.6744293265796
sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore i determined to show him to you myself   18.199289008685497
she cried never   146.926959393128
i say that he is ill informed   84.7084747854028
danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner   123.89293252925047
motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of terror   107.1255757254022
but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment   79.25540097651995
wait a moment   204.8010382160349
thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped   135.8881861263972
shall i call one of the servants   120.94614349370374
such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes that of the abbé dubuquoi from for l evêque   187.23699789412004
that monsieur d artagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king   15.491116423536539
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the auberge of the golden lily   140.11817333601167
has your resolution changed valentine   116.96211352644121
ah pardieu   153.15419067629648
and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back again   115.95692333563484
he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo   98.4874980729939
said d artagnan   71.49689986294922
then going around the house i placed grimaud at the other exit and here i am   187.2713440805038
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron   142.04704898739675
he cried athos   114.26581596861458
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee   116.00175871428002
whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct   203.79115476987192
m   48.72911278967227
said monte cristo   181.0340298246234
yes the wager   244.29902510381464
at length they reached it but it was not the friend   176.5099196590699
it was evident that every precaution had been taken   178.24486525925363
believe me then when i swear to you that you have wronged no man but on the contrary have benefited mankind   36.82703129596166
if we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear us for i guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears   158.29088818241854
ho   205.1465950751213
will you invite young m   103.46497538280742
go in then grimaud said mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet   209.76094785672717
but passion or thirst as the reader pleases   174.68366293839364
of what burden is she   70.34554709941233
suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy   154.15970270643362
ah said he dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness do not talk of such things and suffer love pains   28.916208432797134
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled one   162.2127715292173
andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine   138.5327939099895
oh this is too much   91.57426286212313
is he armed   169.68089719501225
broussel   139.63643395864835
grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent   194.45139264724375
villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal   102.11458379109139
he seized it and attacked the wall   56.986208949732074
then said mercédès i will lead the way   176.58987102756487
the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity   173.18313743141888
people do not go out from it by the door but by the window   149.2355679235
oh i agree with you   89.38562367862737
bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious but he loved his wife   158.76747962221268
then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan andrea had left him   103.91602373417422
he shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the convent   178.714236316754
besides said aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time   214.45417770692393
you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no ill will to signor luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman   100.24155299366527
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of   192.32859877280038
screamed patrick   73.32965435252675
my cousin knows nobody but bazin and places confidence in nobody but him   160.31356658638066
it could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness   199.01980811727915
why the devil do you rouse me at this hour   188.66001453946205
she remembered that she had a son said he   91.79180639726992
or a tiger   98.44933343232918
and shall we take no notice of this incident   118.18810694672686
the stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on guard   66.61784389338895
then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key double locks his coffer and master andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a parisian family by shuffling cards or rattling the dice   147.04742928045084
asked bernouin   149.0460194086817
go on to your cousin then   149.94768799375254
it was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the rhône but the care according to the boy s account that they took to avoid being seen   93.30049692585575

morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting   155.89353059416362
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count that eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship   165.66536217958856
everything is ready is it not   122.80100060534481
you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body   40.69727604879941
didn t you hear fellow   99.71337148819805
maximilian understood him   70.10524493413877
true said aramis   173.09007394715377
no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer   100.22622778214614
the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island   229.65927846304717
albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros   53.88327549427001
yes that is very true mercédès replied the young man yes you have been cruelly frank with me   119.33966849989996
by a fatality that very man bars my way   138.20220419110254
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of 1811 a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee   238.17090799348307
explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations   125.54477025439415
it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination   132.29213687565704
no monseigneur   89.62952800630315
no monsieur it is not aramis   68.55323178936368
at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart   9.85269341717975
asked the countess   182.58099005447377
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates   77.90537682642879
i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me   38.65285848718433
it is not courage that is needed   140.40679287528565
he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated himself   92.93753186580682
said aramis   75.00643083995689
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved   94.17159391974776
that was the name of the soubrette   62.789888869976
why do you say so   85.38804324056008
yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely   104.71647442450843
a don quixote clothed in a woolen doublet the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure   39.548966155551554
speak said the monk   239.49261444781462
i felt my legs fail me   247.8758481141827
i hope not madame replied de winter thoughtfully   96.63891174764252
the executioner said d artagnan and aramis at the same time   128.45424708388418
albert would not do us the honor to be jealous   75.1131374378182
and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see   109.264284792899
cried villefort   39.87840880130834
and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mother s side at least and a baroness in right of her father i will help you in the search   80.84903486713975
i faith said rochefort there s no great difference i think between a dead man and one who has been buried alive   84.51821363140755
murmured d artagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him   76.25529308530753
still it is better than suffering   119.70380620508523
porthos had been trying a new horse   4.111187496438433
cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure   79.37211431866461
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late   137.711168603909
bonacieux to join her   99.17720475530818
selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter   55.27953477709352
that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim   92.99286978342008
the proverb was but too correct as regarded benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition   156.52993377526428
permit me to thank you   92.02519017163881
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow   100.76852272845748
inquired athos   134.85046908019473
in short why should i have any more to do with the affair   15.667797531917941
she screamed my master is being arrested   112.48919470870283
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal   46.42160307687796
interrupted tréville   60.54659203913043
chapter xxv   5.558892022919736
you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening   40.750212118253884
bonacieux   79.8245069662824
bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand   135.50164689027562
ah   170.11518018730237
but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it   89.13153789560252
quick quick   31.1847524022635
i killed the duke of buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain   174.74776944916277
in that case sir rejoined madame de villefort i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes   118.62395950048773
do you hesitate   110.57933409749963
my turn said athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent my turn   33.30708594572698
you do not believe me   110.09699636111047
but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages   163.92565622199112
am i come to a friend   273.835039773874
replied d artagnan   215.52614197387396
monsieur du vallon and myself came from france with him   61.96294705150909
m   77.08353708317183
not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young man   128.76539834665957
but my love came out from it more ardent and more eternal   120.92991701955089
two shots were the reply to this threat   169.51236596971302
that you had been thrown alive from the top of the château d if and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers   167.60806123141623
said he to the host   56.514133191543245
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open   135.09568567362862
but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could   108.86011409448611
speaking to you as a friend i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be   3.6916925365870696
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves   135.54475718524836
and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself   113.732832729117
danglars left last night   154.30585832278757
why here they give you their hand they press yours in return they keep up a whispering conversation permit you to accompany them home   4.057655172648893
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of spain   101.27983515942846
but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed   116.58123599494374
selim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali   111.08869055627352
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords   129.4203531392554
yes   169.83825113885482
oh if you refuse my advice what do you advise   165.87259757051675
madame de villefort was in deep thought yet listened attentively   158.58513628583017
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with d artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them   142.48089930665017
said he in as pure french as has ever been uttered between rouen and tours   21.880129704326848
a key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was audible   150.36626735464606
chapter vii   45.85835837111267
he is said monte cristo   140.892595066088
your family name is monte cristo   29.497079351542226
asked m   140.477256905269
the abbess suspects nothing and believes that i am taken by order of the cardinal   165.02645122862225
neffer neffer   46.402606968169025
gentlemen said the king to those around him i leave you to brave the tempest   98.62552288986939
asked planchet   75.83065820865227
d artagnan and porthos   122.0100751878037
no yes he was   14.70717578226082
asked the queen   125.8100859927485
i believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for i did not ask not being inquisitive   14.997961962487452
perhaps i shall have lost all influence   108.12217407864937
then he added in spanish anne are you mad   172.03427172159525
the young man remained immovable   111.34848904717724
then a double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body   53.45857478647167
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris   235.00412778391893
non inutile desiderium oblatione   165.58527009004172
inquired villefort in astonishment   47.09414889524129
is it then to mademoiselle valentine de villefort that you leave these 900 000 francs   145.9215511947302
only do not allow me to be insulted   52.26139476207193
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose   176.07881769994177
d artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three   216.8410669009781
believe me the cord is more certain than the knife   143.6579872711214
said the marquis   123.03198314031489
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine   58.40453130803374
the king s authority will put all this to rights   167.05551035637146
it is a poor lame post horse   91.10408732489867
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized   163.219316116132
section 3   94.13695789283193
but i fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first   51.77691202357268
pardieu   40.98049511531897
cried the stupefied host some wine   221.16962970950198
today he said with an effort today the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt   117.67454326632728
the brand disappeared   140.40377860202642
cried the major taking a third biscuit   97.89969472772725
how can you know that   73.19288496207199
as long as the procurator s wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself   211.00516835638126
a woman will sell you for ten pistoles witness delilah   156.212778152835
he has served your majesty longer than we have   47.44273689431975
sleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve centres   152.45558702171846
this idea completely restored clemency to his heart   148.2961896615051
you see nothing to keep you a little longer in england   80.06899843635519
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1   164.60556399132668
oh   2.304761346295024
the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment   114.4884388748096
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honoré   134.91174952300554
bravo count bravo   95.62005692281213
asked aramis   187.26851136043427
do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport   127.91651703543761
and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter   195.58950304883138
the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment   27.58634243327805
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my father s brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse   134.08061932602266
listen to me   135.35847199359642
while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife   128.79088051861655
during the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators   35.748338891476976
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation   71.2575099111394
oh make yourself easy on that head said ali smiling   31.630526564065846
i do more than permit i exhort you   189.60713513077462
let us understand each other my lord replied d artagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake   168.34545095541827
well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head   174.09400563445732
she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist   87.64442438746265
but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé   92.77808603704587
i can well believe it replied d artagnan and that was why i got three crowns for him   185.11370336324347
who talks of dying   173.15028219851365
for the last time where are you going   36.88319547259495
in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him   138.5579352153307
the duke   170.94601515402698
greece only had risen against turkey and had begun her war of independence   145.32802291309972
for within an hour the ballet will commence   90.24012009295734
and you albert   199.24510586958888
i think so madame because i myself have made use of them that i might not be poisoned at naples at palermo and at smyrna that is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions i must have lost my life   212.23695677010795
he might have purchased his life by speaking   16.684902538722497
at least i can t now recall it   79.19096328631088
on seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully   169.23835525702043
go sir said the king   63.09878221011296
my children two of them at least the duke of york and the princess elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes   28.06568510619141
while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole left hand corner of the cellar and a tun the cock of which was left running was yielding by this means the last drop of its blood   99.42056732755937
as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent streets   92.2254486631535
you do all this not i   47.608439789985766
but he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the spaniards are ranging through the country and i shall die without absolution   126.91001621160756
no door gave entrance to the room   153.10091368851764
d artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athos s last remark he stopped short   243.75812476620644
well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that i am his neighbor   125.1602635100107
asked d artagnan   19.032983896248396
and about eight o clock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the hotel de la chevrette and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate   141.08071432960878
there was still that diamond left which sparkles on your finger and which i had observed yesterday   180.18751026011657
tired   118.81311495045868
have i anything to pay   163.90184265286456
whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel   75.64104037571158
if your majesty wishes to look out well then look   105.85990097471615
come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go   146.99459492855365
avail yourself of it   97.29869235922453
no madame answered de winter   82.73738173527781
yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but i feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man   147.89413516755198
measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us   161.65846947324798
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well   44.972854170278495
never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling   107.57692349531568
then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged   88.46865462143577
i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it   72.96545466688261
look you my friends   215.83985268455285
only a few days replied monte cristo   139.53532918821458
and her name was do you desire to know her name   101.48508007208542
where   152.212952872008
no one then longer needs my useless life   22.780182580539986
i would have saved madame de saint méran if science could have done it   163.2588183524877
he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep   166.87257514234264
40062m well what is haydée to ali tepelini   130.27236817714675
you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration   234.60709718146956
and previously where were you   93.29399043919953
and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth   93.28869856005741
but what the devil   164.7922826777081
de saint méran   95.19352963575761
is your steward also a nubian   82.05573113003136
dantès meanwhile went on his way   150.05839693519107
but my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached milady this woman is not asleep   114.18809777497724
can you recollect all that   164.3236130306201
but before he fainted he collected all his strength to challenge you and to defy you while challenging you   135.32974446704793
what does he want with me   185.24655524612382
morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed nothing   186.94580444485518
have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison   205.23901660831194
bah   174.49257085850013
taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear   16.661216918417182
i do not understand you baron said morcerf   97.22559821795242
with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors   168.32667991725782
yes repeated the count   241.28150283658604
how soon can he be here   155.20612795907113
alas sir said monte cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought   162.45677220621877
i ordered dinner at that hour and i do not like to wait   102.80331710242706
you are right monsieur it is not with you that i have anything to do   137.8133211412367
to seek my friends   141.41999283955917
i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity   188.37996763969952
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success   128.2279632752884
in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz   157.7451351301609
i propose to defend no one but myself and i shall defend myself vigorously i give you warning   67.61171466624018
said porthos looking around   95.03718741369566
the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper   50.02208366731524
but this creature must be a demon   69.39007605474708
the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold   122.94150348866549
stuff and nonsense   76.25564077471175
i hear no balls whistle and i see nobody   13.421912061677716
said the king   16.019412337178892
i am brave when i set about it   61.002861090693855
as an interpreter of the law do honor to your profession by sacrificing your selfish interests to it   113.64482333919061
is the king dead   40.84249396396568
said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead   50.53918421727822
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped   101.73263284313498
it is no uncommon thing in italy   94.3803147675518
decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you   109.87605539837185
let us go to rueil said athos   112.82772204360127
and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m   73.83730565626165
m   172.00567346185704
god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home   123.51380575908681
in ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a woman   73.28096541184976
well sir said madame de saint méran after a few minutes reflection i must hasten the marriage for i have but a short time to live   13.124192089453501
de tréville growing warmer as he spoke and his majesty was right   129.59710081684594
you have then decided to come to england again said lord de winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in paris never to set your feet on british ground   184.63642391394797
listen   178.0838615570589
this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning   153.3536303846747
receive me oh my lord   92.03262153547738
follow him said athos   72.01716139002616
how   209.68888091999054
from the moment they are suspected by your majesty said tréville the musketeers are guilty   159.09762587850048
your mother albert knows that poor house well   149.0016283643471
he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are saved the bark is supplied with provisions   128.47057299721143
it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint méran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300 000 livres   28.518555707317702
no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death   91.61759021927885
and was this lady young and handsome   173.7054840375664
you must still deliver it said athos   185.93037979761482
andrea said the latter with his half jesting tone   158.8018315543165
asked d artagnan   43.63723664044156
and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de breuil   131.85441005175002
faith he said in italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith there s enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in paris   138.46019819979682
what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy   164.8057919611051
a little better sir   131.62173400652895
that in which we came   70.50883186523396
who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dantès   113.66436918198953
till tomorrow then said aramis   116.65817272534319
really porthos you are a gifted individual   105.61513475061491
he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it   151.7175718330351
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech   205.1810142431685
she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot   123.2779988112288
he bowed to morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible   225.77715512450044
m   245.06567500279624
said the cardinal   207.559051804153
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule   163.70130127283588
murmured felton   54.53085326788263
and have your notions changed   18.729991096136587
since i have this i will keep it   208.07258504333504
continued d artagnan with his frank expression   49.48891183556404
the devil   223.73330708228534
my guards exclaimed that they were sure of it   170.99325962350923
30315m villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball   152.8183282488306
a third of the squadron were lying on the ground wounded dead or dying   52.991496175122464
command sir   98.63967113893037
he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding death   64.89041462047838
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens   46.98318295446316
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse d artagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st   39.228222532145296
my lord said d artagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect   199.26914583308763
ah indeed   112.92457827144784
said the cardinal   86.92382298328538
said d artagnan   228.70713935972805
yes   96.45926667660467
if i live all would be changed   104.75409073050436
that knife which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of because he knows the use i would make of it   191.60831145769004
but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless   204.09341390362832
that is exactly my loss   114.23566023484047
but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business   204.39094493118472
sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate   180.9020163273143
said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture   298.24691982981415
so   166.44776012623169
he added looking steadfastly at the queen   111.05094815435025
by me   78.095189676221
since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government   98.35738361553756
then   139.17344019109083
i know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings   144.19679891051555
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes   66.63699563180101
faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here   114.31622355863229
oh that s nothing   164.6060977686646
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her   44.005527057988544
the cab crossed the pont neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine   122.1344716003207
have you served under the usurper   185.34387228876926
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment   118.10043440305697
the count smiled bitterly   28.768763950991556
now see here will that be all   138.22516462673795
so long as the nets were good they caught fish   165.05835953132208
the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia   41.5254970953942
it must be he   171.5972238433675
you m   127.9525858135347
he exaggerated to himself the power of milady   151.78346568974985
will that do   165.15993678503875
d artagnan picked it up   49.28555408326018
all cried together   126.3198539340508
athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about d artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it   154.99528508883537
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened   218.21175378916678
at what period can that have been   133.79106318114253
what is his name   111.73360186510598
so they have picked up the word and the insurrectionists are called frondeurs and yesterday every article sold was a la fronde   278.32112531727114
all three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools   79.46550909302793
you are wrong then   55.495411567012866
there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes   20.7647983327347
that is why i hastened to you   185.74798702049995
then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse   95.72611978430415
without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance   102.47776118637951
those who are known are not the most dangerous   141.31533420584404
international donations are gratefully accepted but we can not make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states   165.2402534801314
hardly had d artagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication   176.0880485833382
ah   59.217455890085084
sir said raoul returning the count s pressure of the hand i like you already from my heart   29.472513713464124
the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board la jeune amélie having expired dantès took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further   117.09068348068703
villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles morrel to the plebeian   76.52249902789741
then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain   111.42696369631368
whom   63.437685028919894
certainly   40.93733406437369
were you at the opera yesterday   189.51537208720862
one only is still not in our power and braves us   183.0908441806731
monsieur d artagnan sides with mazarin   93.85238232659782
i perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he muttered   202.9040412453056
you say i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag   162.92917487362232
ah things go on gaily then said porthos   161.3722808500125
therefore i apply to you   168.05935569657106
yes i understand was the reply contained in his look   158.2655042663721
i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world   162.9809466025352
the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions   141.02477789377113
oh yes sir you are right it is fatality   36.543249507718
three days are a short time and france is large   76.36102394251047
cried the novice   211.82158760548452
yes   91.07367205998891
what dost thou there rascal   152.2894473362246
but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance   125.74232155766514
you sir   105.50751442761762
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives   192.7700998693793
just so muttered comminges looking after mazarin   95.88644603254866
i know him   203.65146613145737
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey   227.016606137517
for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port   95.4157715983624
you can not take me for a commonplace man a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless noise   9.955971572503756
adieu my dear rochefort   39.44497463634525
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven   110.16178716962497
1   147.51163009189642
for their ransom   50.14333905665691
what   62.453862634349136
well those studs continued mme   95.71558729068441
cried milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if alive   52.11187087238858
then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor what my brother is it you   98.18687432408134
quite a canoe   36.536066428520385
the island was familiar to the crew of la jeune amélie it was one of her regular haunts   178.13499433599588
further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again   81.11936808581285
you see then said d artagnan that i must have that letter   79.25585132266124
it is well   106.88891624370434
what next   205.04125517726203
the man retired but not before examining the supposed juxon with an attention which did not escape the king   179.1074256829408
cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable   85.12052730652073
then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there   41.638133403763646
i hope said d artagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that i am worthy of it   99.36505115719513
de richelieu   143.28985065241278
monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection   9.883580380818245
but this vessel which like the pharaon came from calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the pharaon   157.48576081631109
the baron drew out his watch   122.2927090329566
advance gentlemen said the cardinal   184.27523534662157
yes surely he came with the prince   178.42125112917287
chapter lxii   63.33976937532028
nor you of the prince de condé   42.87958386920815
