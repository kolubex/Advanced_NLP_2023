i won t have dantès killed i won t   73.9474968741845
and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred   57.842177785441656
the sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franz s mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness   163.6364284566888
all therefore of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of europe   45.71389297552193
no   43.62837953559347
and to complete the whole haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers   174.345748676514
the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew it   82.26563468041505
50209m the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the street   15.094541623190068
it was simply yet richly furnished   176.83279482693194
i have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts   104.0703750522571
and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything   71.89206821294394
saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance   4.816127057257162
let us go the same way   74.42710455015863
there s only one man in the world who could stay my hand   34.36667649442509
who told you there was a woman here   93.5273175905219
said athos   148.66739426388466
grunted porthos   118.72868358726878
yes   155.69490103019666
i thought that madame was ill and i wished to bring her help responded the maid frightened at the terrible expression which had come over her mistress s face   108.53637752409647
no one can reproach you for anything of the kind monsieur bonacieux said the young man   136.24049369662373
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them   102.2591635407123
precautions   125.56988552051689
grimaud silently swallowed the glass of bordeaux wine   24.483440336388668
come to our house tomorrow   199.3739453501823
but what have you done   134.69541329872135
full of this idea villefort s face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also   22.10386279748026
his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled   33.92377261685809
but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress   31.212649444017913
the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing   40.5578491989874
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person   153.66096462713836
villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination   101.07911381703417
it appears the conquerors had something else to do   94.74281971406515
the receipt of m   166.51495432739227
their return was cheerful   80.81076033424044
i don t know   90.01835478274243
guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier   112.61724847960747
a cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal   205.82341299375196
that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body   40.36351758986096
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty   105.82327323811454
at all events man or devil body or shadow illusion or reality this man is born for my damnation   220.4656751836373
oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied madame de villefort with all a mother s real firmness   158.49989600375278
i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair   122.90590633737804
so much the worse   163.04895984337472
yes i once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200 000 francs   77.00923583649143
but this time the affair is serious for here is a lady compromised by you   206.8020233928495
he would then be lost and france perhaps with him   193.70038630489333
you are to set off said the cardinal   110.45280766320032
come   96.59645528382661
perhaps   134.50908152596725
at your return i will give you a surprise   65.39238496843717
every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other   119.4816222703348
said d artagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself   39.849831915026954
it was winter s   55.5915689316362
i only arrived yesterday   289.8407274304535
monsieur d artagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain   125.96038653634832
if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view   140.11228542405746
where were you born   202.3380249528392
what does monsieur know this horse   123.54587910146057
they obtained information at ablain and a statement of their route was left for grimaud   165.86725566561034
morrel looked at noirtier who had recovered his self command and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances he had taken refuge   91.27788583674993
then raising him up as tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he can t cry out   87.22053045534824
he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls   135.4181342257545
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere   112.5731086929693
yes yes yes   99.33748887464185
we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it benedetto and then in consequence of this good action god would have blessed us   144.72646803746514
planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and mousqueton   94.16678290282509
he remained there fourteen years morrel said the count placing his hand on the young man s shoulder   139.02025649185592
very brave said monte cristo   120.84842661404068
milady was only a queen while among queens   197.29983097114172
as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and i picked up a million from which 250 000 francs were paid to you for pin money   239.46845983978483
dantès obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal   147.73489069307954
i have it with me   38.499661770263856
and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes   182.12655697022103
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states   29.461269702430513
i am expiating a moment of selfishness and so i always say to la carconte when she complains hold your tongue woman   58.69072935076942
but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage   82.3224212497737
and then there won t be any parliament at all   131.14320464299783
adieu adieu dearest edmond   45.19733105563138

to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which i should arrive   103.68944201528547
be silent madame cried felton and do not speak to me thus   53.947052835444204
precisely answered bertuccio   69.47042905905317
then madame said the abbess smiling be reassured   102.15128010307575
danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression   20.109115338610692
i shall expect you   150.7647017208783
yes here in this convent my dear fellow   109.96418991711222
i will go with you   149.4131965776118
ah the devil no cried albert   66.91080932318638
chapter xxxvii   50.1981979135501
continued gondy turning to the curate of st   95.2974994555203
alas alas what a fearful extremity   148.40611885959763
noirtier the helpless old man at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household that is his grandchild valentine   140.02153505541514
understand me i would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow   118.32174167708692
no but i heard all   24.51116516763058
really this is frightful   91.64398071668943
the promise volume four chapter 74   80.31228522480471
the iron box was there no one had touched it under a beautiful fig tree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot   176.5878630313504
the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his office   117.4224072549804
she declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war   170.5805130185512
where is he   73.16681509978378
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo   121.74799477415101
through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressing room the count could see into the street   156.0879526938436
not at all said château renaud slowly   91.96265148011824
once within the interior of the court the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty five steps   222.81493023800226
yes yes   92.68290979049823
our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada   109.63710030332118
the cavalcade trotted on more sharply   179.71047985950787
cried the people   145.1410643487433
the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian   25.78092907693508
let the man go d artagnan   138.90396932343592
it was useless to search at night and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning   141.033105289743
the two brigands looked at each other for a moment the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow   70.02638703176407
never mind   145.71727178714144
bonacieux   123.26595749842609
with another man milady might have preserved some doubt   267.0193263078464
the heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a rival   59.163523051162606
robert duly challenged the prince of granada   2.1572202947883454
well we shall see   121.99793481834084
good morning lucien good morning said albert   42.32427154399299
well   83.88473366451043
the elder prisoner pondered the matter   125.8968834210052
louis xiii   151.20310806544597
my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question   98.06311746418368
the count took out his watch   125.75331250279014
but his majesty s decision is always necessary   111.78326184695791
the keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself   237.9100640450306
i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these never ending labors   123.72494972510883
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone   76.33681689683004
that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening   125.39015214889179
all the world is wicked   13.130196389762375
i was going to make you the offer my dear d artagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle   173.23940301500863
then answered albert i am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse was   128.7775191128302
has the sun done anything for me   89.93070493387656
20249m well you promise me if i tell all i know to relate in your turn all that i do not know   124.20877223424687
her first trial was lost   175.4097847377383
then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instant s delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late   37.889899276723526
let us go on straight forwards   208.53373579373462
d artagnan related his story simply with the omission of names   24.385952651321645
now victory has abandoned him   9.667376943195308
a light appeared under the door   114.33385183912792
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am   206.3536277190659
well then you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to us   275.74747114801033
mazarin breathed again   173.89120123880878
villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter   136.5060757516185
ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfather s look at that moment would more than compensate for all   116.69276484607875
you have a capital house your own i presume   141.4005375371459
indeed m   225.09448517986334
to crown his happiness monsieur de chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence la ramee was deputy governor of the chateau   164.1913701196998
well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further   104.02628538614553
de tréville who held out his hand to him   100.2601591705092
vampa approached the corpse and recognized cucumetto   98.06627449414772
1 through 1   45.51203404679447
what has he to say   206.18426807893817
but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering   69.64942088848045
there is a horse while on the contrary the hundred pistoles feed their master   146.9236392764192
an instant afterward the three young men separated agreeing to meet again at four o clock with athos and leaving planchet to guard the house   112.75493730534751
come then i see that i must trust unreservedly to you   56.32233521160392
we are well mounted are we not porthos   105.0782185310989
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural   150.3038030618824

halloo   107.29188868091434
let the prisoner be brought in   180.34039577704513
ah very good   220.92905655011822
at this word apologies a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis   84.16324108229401
oh oh   84.00986892056429
non siete tedesco   183.9246766274234
never mind that said barrois   124.46513280651826
20317m caderousse shuddered   108.15421127051258
i wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office   235.92643158743124
he is some spanish or flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol   148.62615631840436
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table   108.34627922874478
my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side   52.1749672786265
d artagnan bowed and followed the queen   78.65712145868304
exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy   74.33459495506749
why i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man   137.6375274395688
you will see continued aramis that it breathes irreproachable passion   121.6791798364257
escape as lord de winter had thought milady s wound was not dangerous   167.13564605411406
the discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous   42.23894525437254
never never   87.39066943909005
i listen i am waiting to hear   131.95944879933427
i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions   139.21222766933406
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem   104.31572559169678
the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him   86.75768797777582
chapter lv   95.89802383468454
the quarters of the king were sometimes at estrée sometimes at jarrie   136.01231183603846
at six o clock the curate of st   187.22986826606927
it is true   212.75392460234386
asked the queen for i hear them   166.7494596935527
valentine held down her head   155.16414232683962
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears   198.41781871953296
it will take place said monte cristo in a most solemn tone   101.65100819716773
a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh   160.92464393187453
what does he appear to be   82.8455939217472
come you shall take charge of the money i of the jewel box   27.79810621261123
you ought then to have a good hand   147.62586727456997
and la ramee   45.135184643257176
an hour and a half   77.85884214072244
said friquet my fortune is made   97.83656069076426
so   82.40882215318649
the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the bone   233.64011944887596
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry   78.51056353778824
i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and sensations   128.6366052714957
oh yes yes   137.9068397356165
asked louvieres   163.0471516476194
oh no dear count   69.1200906324614
go on aramis go on   185.30844654682994
d artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt   203.5914533952396
but but   90.84167198449309
de tréville the guards to that of m   145.72570282900773
besides we shall be there at the time of the flight   159.63369505285468
no   59.30606021909349
planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a situation   66.5373295069084
noirtier and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference   161.0393531928146
egad   111.36678680308437
or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others   66.9922942389363
are you after all unconsciously in love with mademoiselle eugénie   18.178285129393288
yesterday morning madame   90.89908760368266
but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day   154.02407466257384
his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded   76.9098775162397
let her be ignorant that we know her secret   58.19989723686634
it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance   119.64067504057513
and i said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it   95.47216217521503
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire   194.34571924419106
i am sure of it   150.08015869006854
you are abused sir   86.75287955828496
franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained   211.7756177807431
and perhaps become even less than he is   166.79823288336553
we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as before   135.78919338134256
and now farewell   109.51406731095823
i feel myself drawn toward you i who have never loved anyone but my benefactor i who have met with nothing but traitors and impious men   110.56421380539169
the door yielded   139.1008258584044
your sword   50.99254174690596
and who brought you up   134.08360323828276
the company of m   62.75126276513426
their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly tenant   142.18385596517825
i wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment i felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell insensible   120.58595353364417
but her disappointment was cruel   78.76345022287617
he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take   118.9963474789975
it is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably   183.3554264253844
alas yes   107.8723641718905
m   159.41041326612373
your friend albert de morcerf   84.06651112485096
and so my friends we return to paris   156.112531524692
he saw that it was a merciless war between us a war to the death   115.11164874882172
the wise unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing   204.61253912564248
my son she said persons in the count s situation have many secret enemies   52.33037807728395
let us go repeated d artagnan   85.90843494071359
the miserable villain   12.200457947359325
there was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it   94.86191912919669
we may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all   56.93299071800918
and we shall understand each other i hope   155.61250582244054
i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner   1.9859099093981314
ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration   179.4888997293732
the deputy   79.74877039446895
asked monte cristo carelessly   198.45954120793795
you need not fear   105.25363240062103
that is no impediment sir said she   124.34645128598764
never mind we shall see   147.41734688300386
a shudder passed over him   151.90842122008104
doubtless i may but but   128.10487880688106
we went out   51.710703680413005
eyes of an admirable expression   154.9634146003939
it is too much to ask   36.18375297341598
the countess g wished to revive the subject of the count but franz announced he had something far newer to tell her and in spite of albert s demonstrations of false modesty he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days   151.6987331309711
what next   131.8514884132623
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord   74.31703501987357
although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobility s boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants   108.36645415024982
30269m the chest no longer there   106.77693718755759
asked the count   198.15338839498702
it is fernand the man whom after you edmond i love the best in the world   24.75396909330837
well bring it said athos   77.5467933035356
athos took lord de winter s hand and tried to turn the conversation   205.08150335820025
in truth my young friend you will act rightly said the gentleman pressing the gascon s hand with an affection almost paternal   68.93477947190192
the treasure is in the furthest a   49.05814578417856
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us   101.29975419340786
by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon   73.70974133082719
ah la ramee   153.0511222013731
for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair gentlemen an affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be gained   204.98036077526808
tis well we will see if the king s name is not a passport everywhere replied the gascon   70.32739037152535
bah   97.41086823180439
how fast you go   188.24413227134835
and they would be right pardieu   245.93029407310405
these men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none   119.28399866136893
i know it and i expected this result   83.93462991370183
yes   141.71098679619394
that was the question   150.63904571879942
50087m but mademoiselle de villefort stammered the nurse   177.63559019882138
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach   133.13273903884175
i am going to her   102.2288499106967
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look   51.27579720530835
and what shall you do   97.88749708274868
i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugénie   71.25515493162835
although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual time   74.45689960940706
assemble the servants who remain there   101.2754718342759
with every three shots at least two men fell   113.22318216269693
asked madame de chevreuse   172.22532070099763
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information   164.92073668515087
since i have had the honor of being my lord s steward i have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me   114.92571275161443
how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either   181.76455594842923
bonacieux   146.71928785177082
exclaimed edmond that will not be   98.79239199829703
to the rescue   212.47753716316464
felton remained behind   208.23136681718518
we are about to ascertain sire replied d artagnan as he rapidly left the room   13.805914456887166
is it to the judge or to the husband   108.33492272099751
but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse   161.92871827907808
your majesty is bored   16.4540881418948
and i said aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that i will roast you at a slow fire like a savage   69.7929402791333
that s another matter   72.28059522872813
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door   95.8456286199929
then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped   200.66323887933197
murmured the king   58.33831706344448
so much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seven in the morning bernouin came to arouse him his first words were well what s the matter   8.44348419455315
dear child   114.45252221664128
fatality chapter l   79.24618940897162
to preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procureur   117.83945190013696
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter   162.03031222286464
nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question nothing only i want it   193.30113532097258
a prisoner has escaped from the château d if and they are firing the alarm gun replied dantès   85.08765226806142
de boville are you not going to the funeral of poor mademoiselle de villefort which i met on my road here   29.338172886297954
oho   163.20448086091855
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes   35.83195728025095
the concierge looked upon the count with surprise   56.451192590616536
well said she hardly giving franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven and you are already the best friends in the world   116.6395742225055
but his son   60.26334338079359
as for you my dear lieutenant i promise you nothing   81.43063161420407
let us see   93.20835548836585
i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st   147.4865705784282
answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man   125.64681053273941
mme   223.76944943554815
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch   183.55289563622136
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name   124.5523907667369
add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and there s an end of it   197.81648874062125
a family affair athos had invented the phrase family affair   195.5340360765027
at this moment the clock struck   203.86089594774566
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip   170.50072506055236
the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me   93.87265072780937
pardon me excellency said peppino placing his hand on the banker s shoulder   147.79850754148825
yes and important   238.4741040434568
i was not aware my alms were so well invested   155.51330451352626
said the procurator s wife   129.19609188141158
the bell of the convent gate was sounded   146.8008574787435
then in a low voice morrel added this delay is not natural   91.36106512516582
said d artagnan   154.8388647215018
they are compounded doubly strong   208.43092703284532
this done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimney board which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left   87.14549664624292
how do you know that   236.41219413413359
it anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events   174.63535101390875
jesus seigneur   163.09692362603005
fortune is a courtesan   165.5080861263941
they were very happy   123.5202532098233
how is it that i have not seen him   94.48760428496163
yes cried milady but i shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life i shall lose my honor felton   91.80599260162143
monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection   105.27102886000378
not i unfortunately   6.346578539485137
i   139.53741500345234
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything even his father   174.989040930686
you had the nightmare that s all   45.1960732384496
i have taken the whim into my head   77.23669768744033
it is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me   83.84719758291081
that young woman whom the queen took out of prison   58.12498205888421
it seems like a woman   123.80608058193248
and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort l evêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in   228.6299913553957
anne of austria returned to her oratory furious   249.22903663975478
and after her came madame de villefort   38.713291237552184
no we ve been used to those acclamations for some time   199.4047459589061
he will not return until the evening   116.60562230787384
we must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dantès he is so easily mistaken   137.27991902123952
the road as d artagnan had observed was the way to blois   142.19919193786245
in another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept   126.90755085403283
as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs   87.96405175039686
besides i have signed   66.64043927547957
but in case he is beaten   118.64890906121164
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below   226.15992848435198
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself   104.60636751197531
it is monte cristo and his greek   198.93047637184358
de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money a thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready wit in default of money we repeat he authorized him after the reduction of paris to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules with the motto fidelis et fortis   106.3862237833743
he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his temple   170.7061340985728
oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress   103.39986563684606
asked aramis   58.16659306281665
no monseigneur   117.2860895639408
we know that the dream of his life had been to become a musketeer   133.55694039319184
certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said   81.71427083251558
if he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and then so much the better all would be over   160.82110288752784
wait an instant said the host   138.73880775788479
she is dead   35.89581606589185
and woe to those who forgot that i was there   162.06753006102568
the several members of that group were much excited   130.70228399426856
he knew none himself   80.53340296557116
i have no one   160.15908054518673
first my stranger of meung   232.7389444104471
i recognized you at the first glance   159.11355717592357
what   158.21410978203986
many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him   85.21604916485887
oh maximilian maximilian you are certainly concealing something from us   0.09567604246402084
never fear dear friend said porthos   36.26725118852269
a letter   174.34466226665592
the duke wore the uniform of the musketeers of m   256.46897271874326
i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended   123.69397112963597
pray tell me the whole story   123.17883483504691
six o clock   155.6247569043767
well what matters all that to us   52.90773201364973
now listen to me maximilian   164.63007378051933
said bonacieux they took good care not to tell me that   32.87925785612941
eh pardieu   51.30590677585394
what brief   151.51222617913885
f   153.25767063490912
as to d artagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black   104.35650781099804
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them   35.07520151232204
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid   115.9120904484812
with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of amiens   154.50096559901593
he cried   146.51049312015047
said albert   164.7733851323698
asked d artagnan   43.210554015986474
what brings you to paris   0.24325733145589368
they both went into the house   180.94561920569038
and he shouted with laughter   106.39933149077578
be as quick as possible i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour   105.91612570543843
the novice seeing milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior   77.64192588739846
that was an oversight certainly replied the count   68.168887833307
and i even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for you   163.70222334860722
his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity   13.149702148303135
come she added   95.81036028666831
but d artagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty s apartment   208.50740513049521
he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precaution s sake   32.08243068339428
but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this account   71.99607036513197
yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept   84.46142266795405
that is not an answer replied athos   69.89621833649346
that first sight of the château d if which told him whither they were leading him   95.84846932078926
sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all   16.554217823799007
eustache   113.76377939099703
he hastened to open the secrétaire and found the pocket book in the drawer and in it the letter of credit   165.00338241884867
now if you are mad and try to bite me i will kill you without pity   148.90302929915472
the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm   89.80701795562588
but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller s shop it is another branch of industry paralyzed   67.05593358866886
but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them   95.96348285435974
the park is twenty acres twenty comprising kitchen gardens and a common   74.11245202085027
accordingly that same evening d artagnan repaired to the quarters of athos whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of spanish wine an occupation which he religiously accomplished every night   164.76458278468078
she murmured   58.77077700609631
you come at a fitting moment   2.2111750328974296
this is tuesday well tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at tréport   205.16599867154787
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold   91.10640778064406
but a request preferred with so much preparation ah do not fear sir said mordaunt with apparent simplicity it will not ruin you   109.15497873025247
he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six months   97.8494931627056
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable   84.81723206509056
d artagnan took out the parcel which he had desired bernouin to place under the seat   192.50583223449394
cried buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely shouting   120.46640278809286
you raoul not sleep well   21.65798263764998
every instant mme   64.7364907280741

i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said d artagnan   211.40267848697061
gracious heavens m   224.75871513827005
i will not contradict you there said d artagnan   90.73327592190851
asked he of jacopo who sat down beside him   83.63810915756585
i was never in them   151.32132303219922
you fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you   138.7280471683319
a man too who could boast of dante for a genealogist and could reckon back to the divina comedia   111.27692067632842
la ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment   160.49707509034744
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it   55.99285427448549
those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queen s courtiers   206.58755514423464
come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m   187.1928886694589
asked danglars in amazement   181.63042416137932
he will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body   65.00593343723631
whenever you please replied the abbé   174.76725232104945
my dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account   52.95446274253197
you know men better than i do and what you say may possibly be the case i confess   127.07418862035365
exclaimed he turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the host who came in to inquire if he was unhurt   98.01347956724209
have you brought your arms   211.33317855224396
yes you must   114.5566327234676
and we are four one for one   19.18433787958344
her woman s heart was breaking under its load of memories   182.12910789856812
perhaps not so great as you think porthos   163.07533881667047
i will be there   124.95289648886272
i hope that is true said aramis   118.77838832442544
d artagnan was a woman and still more a mother   184.58306419337663
let us say no more about it   109.65879101419124
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her   232.55246779130846
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late   204.86425867003578
and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too well   186.41748056326082
oh cried the duchess i can not make war alone but i can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favorite on the honor of a duchess i will avenge myself   88.2893904007734
have you seen him lately   108.33309962684226
he thought to himself how can i take care of both   36.30813671596951
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it   115.41509173725444
be it half a million then   49.582575223368025
cried danglars   109.19228775966526
the deputy procureur du roi chapter 7   111.68952196204336
his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber   241.45454403071696
this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god   101.95974911399931
de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and d artagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning   152.29241019541183
ah pardieu   16.359902648486752
faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands daume rattonneau or lemaire   142.70389630189732
mordaunt   59.992738425957725
d artagnan looked at the two women one after the other and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion dame nature had made a mistake in their formation   201.12749311883385
tis a bad example   91.29304829292514
yes my son   155.24875136919206
the two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them   168.07128496308908
why i am ready to tell everything cried bonacieux at least all that i know   50.48339202029712
he is worn out said debray   210.47120917251743
nonsense   91.18042424672647
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview   128.25867119536832
mazarin coughed a little   48.95564937048381
he heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door   140.22818159227805
noirtier asks for a notary i suppose he really wishes for a notary   190.82399453763574
the executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping upon his immense sword   111.86340583377587
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat   110.44076070660546
besides the woman wore that black mantle which d artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe   75.93607577328132
it is not aramis   81.00732751202986
oh i see you prefer peregrination   155.52788697689562
but this time the papers were a mere matter of form   191.85091813584677
after a moment s interval cocles appeared   86.63402475003844
they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends   187.36109852096888
i shall be baron   85.92184454946124
asked richelieu   53.522887523840694
that i believe   40.381977765088735
he left his address as he had done before and set off again at the same pace for pontoise   125.54531372934477
and the royal carriage drove on followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen   47.29434533709714
i increased in wickedness till i committed crime   214.69987500736653
but i do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment   72.9095948880609
for that night madame that night you loved me i will swear it   164.72578014845666
louis xiii   269.7527964718081
the guards asked permission of la ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however   107.67439895834048
i am sure he can fire a musket when required   145.65713893094804

albert entered   66.41759699663962
the steps even seemed a parti colored sea that was impelled towards the portico   153.54891300435943
you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these   231.03752139547697
then i have your leave sir   104.4903169141192
i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and i pray you to do so also   37.347012268856275
no voice replied to hers   218.73124565796923
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision   71.09739118110679

the party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor   85.71736711542476
d artagnan was too grand to promise anything   153.77282328406804
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of war   106.81318447784602
but if your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her   63.35128744265026
i seek to divine nothing madame   184.14798287328887
sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying valentine   165.91701905557431
what is that   55.153564439643205
seventeen ages rather especially to a man who like me had arrived at the summit of his ambition to a man who like me was on the point of marrying a woman he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an instant who sees his prospects destroyed and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife and whether his aged father be still living   158.26109878901718
his honor s equipage is waiting said mousqueton   105.45188336415666
but i am here to do you justice   154.31185000169538
i am sure of it   122.59516535882317
felton made no resistance   197.33187805848172
he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night   108.16621203147106
you have suspicions nevertheless   56.9910966946798
it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form   119.31933039825638
said porthos   54.92366937346229
because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking   133.36243379250385
blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension   222.2940523171943
i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the arabian nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie   111.99121369009427
these cries had something so heartrending in them that m   132.32988923991098
i will confess all to her i will tell her daily that i also have committed a crime   136.73265587208485
tréville s company   179.74311529529467
then you disapprove of duelling   86.61604344965359
it is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you   96.69531782465668
the sailor departed without reply   24.27086068640186
what is it you want dear grandpapa   63.69391954251881
but if the pharaon should be lost and this last resource be gone the poor man s eyes filled with tears   61.97652975286581
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac   59.21520499419203
he mentally ejaculated   187.85436209434803
and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship   157.24929249857527
stand on one side d artagnan stand on one side cried athos   110.88936944643439
i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment   221.46915175848682
you would follow the escort   139.41321606266746
aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening   74.23471220873571
when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover   81.80499050200225

chapter lxv   152.63515062053233
and d artagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends   93.01880608325493
next milady whose secret i have discovered   117.28911753793913
therefore i shall not get into a passion with them   75.34379321450427
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream   169.27619602979928
they made him enter this carriage the officer placed himself by his side the door was locked and they were left in a rolling prison   55.43787266651128
you wish to terrify me i suppose   129.95920344878232
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father   64.34327814734705
well the abbé adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage   103.73471978414132
mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing   105.20507108568678
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate   1.6259548177242351
death to the cardinal   146.63406952623936
i used not to do so but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them   108.6489869588057
well what have i to do with that   176.3636439136686
he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man and fainted   49.33922560252816
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure   159.47371617452364
i too sir was almost dead when you arrived   113.21021166206279
after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual   154.62274071861665
pray regard me as a devoted friend i beseech you   146.19419271779185
for if i remember you told me you only expected two persons albert   84.9126808382494
my son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here   200.61751083174985
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom   149.9830060009556
still   71.65449221450754
athos went down and returned immediately   39.12827834848542
the best you could have at the present time believe me   154.2174908764901
you have said puritans have but one word   128.1670932230754
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them   57.69560357108188
albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered   120.52244451364405
they made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses   154.46451992697257
isn t there still time to repair the evil   38.129897058051554

she came three times whilst i was a child to my nurse s house   84.87316083738665
faria gazed fondly on his noble minded single hearted high principled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose   230.34447703873667
upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him   130.46647831144892

poor eugénie   48.35521213681726
rest yourself mother he said   121.70865607064242
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors   69.40967070499627
you are wrong to speak thus said the abbé   151.25060787726736
said valentine   23.20358054763325
ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a café on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julien and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes   92.43587235291265
the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks   126.69194312842708
oh saved saved   127.9509148423578
yes was the laconic reply   177.4213024469081
cried the duke will you not accept any money from me   68.32103287318984
the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper   51.519851653897916
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water it was the general s body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead   60.44240602125461
the latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting   160.5733345387799
they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house   215.99266677770817
the monk   157.1991311068026
very good replied albert   7.762142179381328
might not this young man be sent by his eminence   135.93318599697255
have you the keys   178.77724079491892
then i shall say the duel did not take place   133.92041625528114
well madame said de winter when the queen had dismissed her attendants   38.141515527844604
monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips   87.57271697298833
i should think so a horse that cost 5 000 francs   144.84922135776407

ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching him   129.39567073145238
as soon as she was gone noirtier made a sign to morrel to take the dictionary   151.5341669942323
you say this my dear boy   74.13897090459554
that s strange   232.11231215086727
i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you   100.47266667478732
all doubt of his identity was now at an end   194.24287166123406
certainly   71.62873469197936

thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known mousqueton well   36.58101112224787
it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo   142.36094137782368
danglars kept up the title of prince   154.14157928803613
but you guess it now do you not   15.242939232523156
twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in england she was already married in france   86.91765282777249
the mendicant shook his head   120.8237154643544
i will join you again at marseilles   25.524096460889893
but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there insults   151.85734669581956
so much the more reason   114.5439259163784
excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth   132.36553849118874
this evening s adventure will serve for my excuse   7.825340456912073
villefort s father laughed   5.087074139778977
no doubt he is as rich as danglars as high in station as fernand   225.69238358514193
he said   20.460290990275837
what do they say   1.6010590360164088
kitty drew a little note from her bosom   130.29920064593347
the riot   143.64072618934972
as they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio   19.307361723944396
he found athos and aramis philosophizing   62.66000744252203
my god said she what a senseless fanatic   141.7134917670609
he was the son of a banker at lyons named particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to emery   165.2655737531079
asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone   111.76357562465861
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke   241.0912280807306
i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years   134.30459232089078
morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point   84.72905952374164
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time   65.74206776720922
it is not the king   170.25376037006285
but do you really believe it is she   127.17399665107104
so much the better for i have expended all mine in chartering a vessel   277.54226633604515
be kind enough madame to listen to me said danglars   121.3981389108882
asked château renaud of debray   16.97840604849702
ah   198.30126742063368
grimaud remained with his hand extended   99.31138628390849
but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious   78.14482676443687
mother said albert with firmness   135.62475590673236
a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents   144.21601193222003
and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time   131.4894355389741
he said to the lieutenant   200.94290835620964
why to me   95.46191821946604
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much   8.189020641733833
there is a struggle in nature against this divine substance in nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain   147.49128507237117
you will restore me to life   69.73759720088387
she had heard something said about supper   205.38979419300315
thanks d artagnan thanks   17.2560222862343
the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step whilst athos and raoul descended   120.66404737944285
i do not know the young man   223.18489786037225
my wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in thought   204.04377815281276
he endeavored to speak but the words died on his lips   120.03689074985931
you are really too difficult to please   94.16353684966163
i didn t understand it all he said but i understand now   153.7959344121673
and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the door   176.0369967417048
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates   128.35973674953064
it is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so   16.716052212673958
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment   114.96830224232514
tell them yourself that i was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st   112.1745166271971
perhaps it will be too late said gondy still unmoved   190.09766847844298
ah madame said porthos in the most melancholy tone he could assume when we are about to enter upon a campaign a campaign in which my presentiments tell me i shall be killed oh don t talk of such things   233.28869945430978
no no be easy on that score   155.3897076620567
no no no no no she is not there replied edward singing his words   101.78431978653029
at half past six the duke arose and said very gravely certainly caesar was the greatest man of ancient times   62.1965119960073
said gondy   149.8440306041995
and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the atlantic   197.79215339538763
where is providence   120.46770502031771
be satisfied said d artagnan laughing porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess coquenard   130.77217264744542
you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything   153.90051927873094
you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night   135.26716517945943
and the duke pointing his pistol at aramis fired   38.39593297776622
therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can   127.67961140277623
by heaven and earth   181.4462581449586
monsieur d artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he robs   63.71060938197689
what s the dream   154.231656519671
skirmishing   146.57731084421576
it is the truth however   87.65192517894343
but how can lord de winter my protector my father asked felton possibly be mixed up with all this   18.315489779032433
we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos   209.30776113749175
confound it yes   18.27883246507406
the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud   49.948846801097005
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength   53.60016275463518
said carlini   38.01185429573512
i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of mastrilla   103.0349322838061
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector   7.748336019688367
cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this look from teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of eve and he returned to the forest pausing several times on his way under the pretext of saluting his protectors   163.89443142531175
which   142.8746080337179
noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m   132.49957477195085
without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel château renaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m   252.24133325304484
true   34.78889695122133

lord de winter arrived at the appointed time   196.66100641037596
tis you la ramee   125.6679360155111
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation   141.2695103556676
ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may   136.8052606127593
this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentine s absence had done   173.35233433790756
he again struck it and with greater force   257.4778149991048
oh   70.26363946485257
i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle   131.79607506565424
that health which excellent my dear friend   125.68972783233244
repeated the agitated mother   137.68192486839513

a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty   155.16792094711886
racine says   62.72628654226685
it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of athos murmuring he is avenged   102.45287921526713
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away   141.6796921227081
we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel son of marseilles   164.09746003062236
she told d artagnan that lord de winter was her brother in law and not her brother   78.12310171857987
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions   168.81708899291908
certainly my lord   17.48742055701308
but amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme   135.69679823193536
let us shut this one up   156.22242149989708
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now   135.7457213251265
every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion   63.8336358765295
we no longer talk we rise to dissertation   88.39674109093013
the price of his blood   146.17419506196674
tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke   122.97690909474629
said felton   232.2417559723021
and madness   20.669633437498106
yes   102.03540078569637
i must die   202.20126611551086
but what is the matter with my hands   66.6902576585989
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour   128.67239391858442
was faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to faria   185.3533751903169
asked the duke uneasily   184.23794550680935
hem   67.97374973308575
but unfortunately i must wait   95.13123777168059
the host on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses advanced respectfully to the door   117.8934632846463
fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body   151.82933734436386
the steward bowed and was about to quit the room   13.698948346635476
de beaufort is he still in prison   132.88783538209506
no i grieve not on my own account i shall always find a resource   119.94867326016598
they mounted the king on winter s horse and winter on that of the king   209.3648615031846
no   105.20377825275605
come gentlemen have you decided   168.7244288083694
i am sure of it   90.74471186338342
it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father   117.76293973142529
asked villefort   12.891246758639838
said athos   67.58761975403755
monsieur said morrel whose uneasiness was increased by this examination you wish to speak to me   42.69749622782467
come let us see what you will do for me   13.04686766992701
there is nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter   141.50347738195316
the woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her   63.83571653834847
if the king consented to see them they would only have to be called   138.19621035116373
the bare idea would kill me would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my finger nails   149.44587820037617
i m certain of it   84.88550989557741
i am not aware of it said albert smiling sorrowfully   233.17113921873653
ah said mme   120.02813786725835

well said porthos arrange the table mousqueton and while we breakfast d artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us   99.53168127885341
yes   209.59894887424022
pay and eat   75.44242969448892
but the queen will perhaps refuse to obey   124.29014870400114
the two things agree marvelously well   177.00074646664302
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and felt all her resolution return   112.56676695578743
every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen   99.59000617299841
at what hour shall we come   118.44680009549036
i should be delighted to do so was the reply   74.35599141739402
danglars raving threw himself on the goat skin   196.89518881608058
the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la réserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar   118.38698254821682
you are right cried the gentleman   163.92126239568898
oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellency there has been such a drought   169.0835043615283
journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in company   163.9978543801564
haydée whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked you do not know me   80.5454132711989
did you ever meet him previously to coming hither   31.514961359661612
mousqueton followed two lengths behind   143.8041213797627
thanks to the attentions of raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him   54.328112867968954
i like dantès   36.48394066349583
yes that is true said she and i will confess to your majesty that my husband your husband has none   135.1667058264756

said porthos   58.73721943434151
sir said comminges declare yourself at once   111.80323989400831
at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right   238.41455071131196
but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died   81.56364171935685
but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition   88.57671126443724
i went to work   140.8577152752513
all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows   136.12595097710295
it is true   42.908257075065265
de morcerf begging me to attend the opera   79.49088183874117

come come said albert do not assume so much indifference   91.95843129290294
now sir said the count you are safe calm yourself   25.941745590869147
kill as many as i could my lord   57.51897992671445
the king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing   89.07626050763147
the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters   76.81684744848084

villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars   118.6451860405961
20081m oh they are simple enough replied the host   139.04598025999454
the dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother   128.252341699395
constance constance   224.61772761182957
the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the ante rooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop s palace   29.160391685834867
listen   80.59693994095866
you are perfectly right my lord   69.19650234551003
he confides him to my care   53.85684441126171
never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself   63.206491559662105
the surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have fainted   95.38083809355291
he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed   182.61088605904786
here are two english gentlemen just arrived   119.48763854493788
and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin   112.86637394173526
yes that is the very boy   192.85098436883007

the valet de chambre appeared on the door steps   183.16358454850476
the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio   135.02936448182774
well you can go out by that door whenever you please   110.99308651472909
the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught   199.66361598936905
cried felton   130.78786554805282
ah said morrel one quits a dungeon in a week a month or a year   147.59646852803937
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning   116.49783091077217
still there have been men who suffered more than you   179.47934269835486
as he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye d artagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt   50.26546887647869
d artagnan   243.82895246122683
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us   100.22377075255565
a terrible vision chapter xli   131.81086300414756
then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold   55.49628841143628
no said caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5 000 francs   117.76148815191347
ears have they but they hear not   227.88888513798835
what country does he come from   231.9679261241051
whispered aramis to athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt   219.2958710884086
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with château renaud and albert he did not hear one word of their conversation   140.6808216370222
cried d artagnan it s quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here   3.1147683087833684
d artagnan unfolded the paper   55.417170302435615
and i have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at boulogne   46.99044276110075
down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible   99.82636750128869
he buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one is about to leave it   0.5362457602954294
my father as i told you   65.0813398580161
you are determined to leave the chateau   97.83570606246722
yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it   5.42746944728259
a third pistol shot was heard aimed by d artagnan and one of his adversaries fell   121.02602164629535
gold a devoted friend and a letter from the king our husband and master   48.21357122845831
and now to table said athos   102.6271313592884
i wish to tell him replied friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way   18.08070085215701
you are not a woman said athos coldly and sternly   204.61476346103436
and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer   100.66439293826149
oh i entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it   87.97689130308525
the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds   117.30191739568724
mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole   200.72463629920745
yes your excellency and it is true   232.4037180274381
and i have none   183.44300267265336
if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew   146.36571838684318
that is better said the gascon   23.065240013547367
very true replied the gascon but i always run away from compliments   175.38420008499827
oh as for that i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are made   212.71165150707765
now as ever i am nothing but your servant   85.64024548324468
her husband is only my brother in law that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me   231.75606757640395
but i do know you have nothing more to fear   178.26321893777228
i was saying it was very interesting   121.59939172008004
inquired mercédès eagerly   73.9077541212606
i may continue to rely upon it may i not   87.84029104258634
the young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the servants   111.48867663606313
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him   160.0564909479052
unfasten it or i will break it in   76.03406864049344

warn his friends too   75.62069261822793
said d avrigny with surprise   154.18610397598363
and this king s attorney was named villefort   105.99476484042601
the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested   59.196657060574495
the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch   204.6848371491113
what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this   151.76085364019065
m   207.82092274853687
cried d artagnan   137.7233075647123
you would not like poor andrea to have his throat cut by albert   149.01722861199872
d artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of dionysius spread a carpet on the floor went upon his knees and made a sign to mme   85.22362119889257
the prisoner is there replied vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and i will go myself and tell him he is free   69.2729256023355
it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime   173.1034785233609
it became as dull and vacant as before   69.28171185243502
and i shall die in the performance of my duty   118.26350257802953
that we may be discovered   158.89367280456506
the justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of god   140.36176385038763
do not boast of what you have come to paris to do or have done   130.22733958223404
and where is this man   120.89936687097811
said he   8.290463182741192
thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796 parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries   138.3088571488127
it consisted as we have said of a small dressing room opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone   60.43412886643597
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened   128.2827621858909
about eleven o clock in the morning they perceived amiens and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn   188.13235360363427
i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence   127.04214600423319
money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard   88.72832432937273
you know something about him do you not madame   67.20393496401559
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon   138.3005063299023
and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable   133.23186668205796
exclaimed cromwell   78.65731242119996
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other frenchmen were standing pale and menacing   88.07055395488089
we shall see said athos for we shall go to the sittings i presume   187.5482410945574
athos was then sent to the cardinal   132.14728718762876
morrel looked at him in utter amazement   147.9515795276338
and of this profound skillful and anxious study the result was that felton everything considered appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors   229.9060817482537
this is the mystery said danglars   125.72148420206469
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money   164.92381763974493
you are safe you are free   234.0682846610893
ah indeed   156.31257169815433
then came the royal carriage with d artagnan on one side porthos on the other   57.523840709793625
whereas mme   140.13429486249262
my dear athos he said i am going away   60.90637873031895
true   120.31695262652833
in fact as we have said the whole camp was in motion   48.47585518222455
the arrest of montague   109.57405320504114
it is my turn to be of use to her   68.82307000411228
near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing   79.92205574472868
you know them likewise   108.72306650612308
one went to support d artagnan the other porthos   216.7316310252898
should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task   164.77674559434462
yes   123.67362801278608
sir said monte cristo to him i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings   100.36982223373263
he fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month   17.97874517759989
and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly   125.76314200745257
he had observed between the house that madame de longueville inhabited and the convent of the jesuits an open space surrounded by a hedge   63.419591729268724
my strength is in my weakness   24.637583815161662
behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her   130.69152866354065
i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaetano but you questioned me and i have answered   49.2541805797747
you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied   122.37313682698914
you wish to ask for liberty and i give it you   62.690869377649335
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference   111.52018815353459
albert beauchamp and château renaud remained alone   119.78242568287878
said monte cristo   172.83231023232673
very well said d artagnan his eyes aflame battle   103.45363116788967
give me the despatch raoul   6.955640388846575
that is all i require   184.49676542847084
for i think you told me it was a boy m   126.5257549463504
monsieur said the cardinal are you a d artagnan from béarn   46.70242385295208
the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man of war   96.61867531946254
are you still resolved to accompany me   90.04664157225213
they took their places and the ballet began   124.91381539234878
now see here will that be all   33.43826785821621
the count advanced to meet him   120.51914680945278
and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat   161.70499490729642
the man took his way toward the city   88.79214353975622
the eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water   181.83758165551012
at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred   27.0527439799655
i want capital to build my plans upon   110.35928808009321
remain here   62.47463274520707
said the queen radiant   173.92614278257975
this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know   35.90631264843752
no   238.90695372420302
i have been liberated by someone   193.62929555893848
and he tapped thrice two taps close together and pretty hard the other after an interval and lighter   59.03758907393874
cried the young woman in a manner so serious as to make d artagnan start in spite of himself   118.9626996814018
he found as provident a host and a fresh horse   106.86313325770284
by my soul said aramis she is charming   195.2952535916425
yes   108.92547376531729
my lord he asked where does your eminence wish monsieur comte de la fere to be lodged   57.63714062186452
to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the valet   25.64164438866922
monte cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa   94.58746296010938
was andrea s first thought   82.55482440336431
but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever   129.13988212381673
how so   93.05081396358065
but jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to yield   34.1406586961492
good morning my dear host cried d artagnan   219.88449013456258
but it is your own fault   157.51074322281343
i think i know him   106.14039621939314
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other   101.87128704269125
or rather you remember it   88.52439601650126
mazarin bit his lips as he spoke   130.5002617218618
it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters   165.02558366394024
never   195.49195466803423
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue   161.38322417530958
here he is here he is   151.67959502871585
read this letter he said handing it to her   128.63324387320202
just so   65.97302522539572
as to the cavalier in the brown cloak it is the cardinal   164.42794642534886
a letter from the viscount   38.07795854505797
only listen to that charming finale   5.898175278599865
de tréville found la chesnaye who informed him that they had not been able to find m   96.86535954191939
back   84.28419783894833
i could drink four more such bottles   27.433996006895683
still silent valentine had promised not to wake   46.131189643140004
30207m good he said   157.63132953418543
here is monsieur comminges said d artagnan returning to the cardinal   218.4601466139707
the sergeant drew near to planchet   2.2534733654245542
i shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me   29.40498521729161
that is a dream also   165.41219157696105
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted   150.01626431222667
i like the means well enough said d artagnan but where and how to meet with her   223.42489361883543
and see here it is said the count   185.78511935817713
oh what agony   85.12565606246368
but a mother has twofold sight   68.84713185911454
the man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again   49.05711403591545
the youth looked pleased   109.48589298393838
and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the prince de marsillac   139.30301574105079
but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus   84.978401992852
murmured valentine   95.92357315732635
the chancellor sequier who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly stood before her relating how his carriage had been smashed how he had been pursued and had rushed into the hotel d o that the hotel was immediately invaded pillaged and devastated   131.7659480558915
great god she is losing her senses   31.300812633334544
haydée what an adorable name   154.61802186122776
but monsieur louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me   110.224906538181
go into the grotto and dress yourself   163.87207535511612
the officer s face expressed complete stupefaction   11.13161739504821
then d artagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted friend   65.18687865955238
cried porthos   142.48131260751222
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service   95.03762248587489
the will as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things   53.247487281301844
faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death   69.46464309350793
two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires   100.30003919157036
without reckoning replied monte cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since mademoiselle danglars is an only daughter   69.58072650054285
once at the house of monsieur créquy   134.02244478965665
you are certainly a prodigy   41.869096385079786
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis   142.65163699062322
good and beautiful as you are   152.18740174445787
besides liberty of conscience is established in france   171.09866838213864
they don t have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four   55.24057021641757
i was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained   125.28863544395792
here i am in their name said m   110.4024229691482
the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain   49.02483983277655
only warn him that it is you   98.27896982901859
zounds lieutenant   108.38322173720115
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz   55.820837512503076
then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles   200.37507603246553
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse   184.69851599675866
i am sure he will look like the great mogul   119.87354711125009
the south was aflame and to assist even on his death bed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès was stigmatized as a crime   100.66762378957873
tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dantès venture   47.53220590942354
she loved porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus   107.56249161526478
that s nothing new   139.3167231424385
and i said debray   35.2327139383862
i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity   103.69121702703045
that i may be sure i have the right man   109.22284725580307
cried milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert swordsman   150.87570025677877
so much the better mordioux   157.6612965657497
asked the old man   75.68300951197935
i shall perhaps have something to say to you   138.74788482099675
franz d épinay i am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villefort s absence and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me   135.01555995699178
and what is it to me   175.2340709779619
i am at least fearful of it   36.4365357201894
on the honor of a gentleman   97.12509910923643
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur bonacieux   169.4361893444108
at length the hour drew near   210.42867248984174
the former dantès proposed to augment the latter to remedy   90.58936669696469
are you on the ground   108.44215257583774
milady looked at this man and hesitated   106.54401065807292
exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips   10.261454267150043
nothing is impossible replied milady to true love   121.88908680336327
and bazin   96.60682812301619
what is life to you   98.9759959241974
nevertheless you can understand that when 700 000 francs leave the wife s pocket the husband always finds it out   148.75584230034974
who o o pla   184.4419668816375
i make no secret of it   45.59544796885167
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead   39.03736432774937
and who has abandoned you is that it   161.68298393345162
ah   158.23280788602435
athos did not even turn his head   23.617223429669252
they wished to take planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five o clock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis xiii   88.93260112628417
they had besides to look constantly to their own proper safety   98.34712739227568
what would the patron think   101.45357319260026
i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca   122.39088407292559
then you will appear   65.54062397784409
no one knows what has become of them   132.98542719544
the cicerone sprang into the seat behind   239.61566980685043
deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful   188.817640353279
she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses i conducted her   123.5993143710668
and having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment he placed the others in the ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a talisman   80.94548047444897
and it will be even a disadvantage to you   145.53022088403972
because said albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them   99.14703694808341
you call yourself in paris the count of monte cristo   173.49564453802165
said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents   101.06882338692692
and bassompierre was right   65.02528863511992
permesso   92.56870937776924
that man knew of retreats more secure than rueil darker and more silent even than the bastile   122.70113097564435
but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension   127.68355966010074
de tréville   168.70435282067808
ah   79.46766276695725
tall well made   193.88148167972986
the coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his life   173.55155204881265
tis like a duel   125.99706413185073
he knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man   139.43197804093165
i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel   127.63835579309921
he s not going on a message for he goes secretly   155.9390881752656
the papers said something about it did they not   108.90428486704295
no   153.35999726774193
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men   55.310791497824376
monte cristo took the gong and struck it once   107.62635738367742
porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary   116.44496940134346
de villefort was a powerful protector   90.53891557343353
the officer entered   52.562336123907755
but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting   88.40551090770218
but has he any enemies   123.13197051091436
is it my fault you have lost 700 000 francs   86.2336986550237
it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman   91.64777928803068
i repeat to you however and this time on my word of honor i think perhaps too often that i am in haste great haste   132.11820562562002
he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return   126.5592972458701
we will go on gentlemen said the queen   73.16710818824642
when he had finished he said my mistress said she should expect you sir as soon as you had finished dressing   231.01789048082242
yes he has just gone out   184.68312132721726
the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground   160.16132239847548
he had not done so for ten years before   179.25806345789562
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you   148.6855712713561
cried the young officer   144.018461968434
well i i m not rich   26.096566832410005
having accomplished these three social duties monte cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say i have done my duty now let others do theirs   108.72763908911628
what is it   150.3185804904904
so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest   202.14571734487782
not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy   156.70329077220325
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a labor saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre   168.37318931789522
queen   181.22664274578474
9   181.91527247650157
the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you   113.35259743995573
40024m such was the conversation in almost all the carriages   167.28339947623277
emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard the well known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived   165.25283499585686
demons do not die so easily   202.70536374445044
and d artagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a sensation   128.12652222787284
about this time the nurse s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand   101.90046920661577
resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night   183.40695225910045
shall you be attacked on the road   140.71023859433222
yes added athos i now ask you d artagnan what side you are on   196.74949874939125
sir interposed blaisois i warn you that i can only swim in rivers   75.63221773516557
that gentleman is the abbé d herblay replied he   160.40983996524267
people went there in crowds   19.38962648040902
i do not understand you said debray with freezing coldness   95.89116496987332
the young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the pont neuf opposite the samaritaine   172.49083054453683
d artagnan looked at porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man can not help feeling at displays of crass stupidity   39.24613251790353
i did not mean to say silence silence   100.69031644773426
doubtless he has   5.595768496983382
go on go on my dear fellow   72.08264614885854
if this ship founders like the others he is a ruined man   33.79844040435373
yes replied the stranger   65.68546577148433
raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed   64.60349808586955
those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious   93.10405899162409
but then he breakfasted with me indeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion   114.56475781849448
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and d avrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child   194.16682773519193
then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset   75.92744807176953
the monk s eye again flashed but that was all   18.84526754570436
the king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said this block is very low is there no other to be had   140.090426680895
milady seemed overcome with joy and made kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de wardes when he received the letter   74.9791283450356
stop a minute   66.18533345391867
1   126.4099129197547
are we then to go to war   179.084351127631
that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them   217.9956683932741
the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world   194.74045059575073
once out of auteuil andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity   188.12660479006854
truly   73.38262384993556
noirtier s countenance remained immovable   98.38295850386771
i maintain my original resolution   279.93457961941454
he made a sign to cocles who went first   130.81689420685473
mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queen like grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on raoul   224.71599883088288
andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room   5.897249478776033
i know them cried milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart   148.71026898021347
de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless   72.90629296609984
where has he gone   112.89719675162623
i am sorry to say i can not replied the baron   126.90409738370052
because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric   170.6293870120599
all the others remained on the right hand bank where they fell on their knees   130.96804793060556
it was in valentine s room   71.83089558504327
and you see you would have been deceived   70.5764494996277
d artagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts   31.618937895535268
you are right sir always right said anne of austria   96.34435038942377
well returned morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune i must habituate myself to shame   171.7136651023555
they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville   149.60065670484622
why didn t the baron come himself   180.74923583462126
we will do the same   75.89945967741822
oho   104.03336295486676
his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same   154.96599679787832
monsieur d artagnan   197.25044166110138
andrea took the pen   170.6763277281924
she was said to have a weak chest and like antonia in the cremona violin she would die one day while singing   137.47928039327982
the fact is mademoiselle said barrois i am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me i can not say i should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it   115.2838585801098
exclaimed d artagnan looking in astonishment at athos   116.93753593276273
where your life was spared   137.31377875178802
asked valentine astonished   136.10912219944376
and i madame   132.47982249667749
and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed   29.535585815795386
the two friends recalled by d artagnan to what was also due to porthos pressed his hand in their turn   61.62444694498251
ah my worthy gentlemen cried i what do you want   98.74374672943304
no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and d artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever   102.09858840033361
d artagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated   298.6456070563354
look at me madame at me whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly   128.34932210922472
ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger   149.4569286188518
good the execution of plots is my forte   86.02905816156046
the duke meant to say affection   173.93065872304635
at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile   74.46799463454077
i believe that besides the packet captain leclere confided a letter to his care   187.87086767904793
de morcerf into the drawing room said he to baptistin while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase   69.8248802729951
the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmond s time had all disappeared   17.719705967705693
sit down there before me d artagnan   140.44113966742069
de villefort to m   171.66988611794494
you and i alone know of its existence   235.848491185902
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway   73.83797773986271
strike i am prepared for everything   32.72641240263464
he has been a soldier a smuggler in fact everything   71.9389172383797
may i also be allowed said morcerf to pay my respects to mademoiselle danglars   89.8610278770588
which   123.01478269182513
in the cellar   58.531819484865366
let us see   102.82346250818999
no replied d artagnan no noise   207.1940504278354
do you know the writing   121.63786774714447
asked the marquis remarking the cloud on villefort s brow   120.20819304246798
valentine raised her head struck dumb with astonishment   136.1333596884029
good   146.38387998854932
come calm yourself and reckon them up m   148.43399737595698
if we have no news of them this evening to morrow we must start   155.2695271653733
this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son   162.98155531413113
halloo   180.52879241058366
yes   107.21359125873963
m   159.35565310597698
they proposed a game of bouillotte   186.69215256340343
good evening comrade said d artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner   46.285076219375924
warn him as i have warned you   119.46204171712952
busoni turned around and perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrate s face the savage lustre of his eyes he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes   189.74368343797758
athos remained sitting   177.279175882747
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections   40.46270490583758
i had but to write to the duchesse but i won t repeat her name for i am incapable of compromising a woman   117.46436068640509
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry   54.943463894529316
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words   147.39566614184517
if you are in haste monsieur said d artagnan with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days and if it be your will to dispatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself i pray you   230.43384138631205
de château renaud m   94.3009751649134
i am rich   102.5677308654372
you have no reason to envy him on that score for i owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which recalled marie michon to aramis and to athos   116.8843427235241
you have the means then of touching him   143.95375682962924
it was too warm in the room was it not count   114.13746128605659
and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of 100 000 francs   52.87345267524888
at this word athos and aramis jumped up   165.9590919937359
this war may not only bring great catastrophes upon england and france but misfortune upon you my lord for which i should never console myself   149.21951644748572
cried mazarin to the coadjutor   93.94029881841172
but do not do not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and constrained   75.6729412901341
noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir   187.5698414503869
will you this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances   142.95882293937234
who could desire my death   120.24508419233209
you   143.01822176197368
give the lackeys money and they will start   202.1535322515321
that s the first time i ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot wounds with cat o nine tails   54.12099159055729
the door was wide open a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yard a strange sight before so noble a mansion   155.90274071427223
monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent   144.71426447618586
why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine   126.68167898936856
and extending his hand towards the table he seized a knife   47.122122792571844
felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body   135.60142337041574
your case is not an ordinary one   108.00889281393422
but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised   184.121880292681
they carried a banner on which could be read this strange device we are seeking our king   156.6821413596375
at this moment planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont   178.32131583425192
i know it   201.5847318052035
pale and trembling milady repulsed d artagnan s attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of bed   79.44743656778027
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by d artagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them   172.7258279062273
d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard   121.98777766024627
the musketeers lackeys included were seven   62.34304542301222
do you know this gentleman   162.26857546683885
then when de winter rose to take leave listen my lord said the queen   22.37325931140154
speak maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already full   59.54606482986162
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count   35.66444611055678
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised   160.86408985075877
with you d artagnan with you porthos all four reunited for the first time for twenty years we would dare not only england but the three kingdoms put together   19.63787904792835
yes said monte cristo   90.1860237372338
said he come here so thou hast changed thy trade   57.339681303855606
i go into the garden i plant i prune i trim i kill the insects all day long   171.23858508735333
his host here was a good fellow from picardy who gave him all the information he needed   69.4380516406398
i do not speak for him but for myself   52.75708581335252
athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven   187.91656813823136
and he is dead   55.9548874125794
well let us pledge the ring but upon one condition   104.29584656267798
ah my dear count said albert   159.50477706359433
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking   176.32609428191606
i attempted to cry out   174.72825939194138
do not fear   53.845541827680755
he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do   191.13347424881192
tell him further that i hold montague in my power   46.21991541854288
the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning   145.33192069992106
chapter xxvi   191.02536834349203
i have not time for anybody s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests   66.59818999522541
de château renaud one of the best riders in france and m   121.91594983318362
whenever it shall please your majesty   83.36268390349488
the aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of october   147.28675598986976
our game is beaten up   113.89942766462666
that is possible monsieur   248.92011120009212
ah said he they have sent some fencing master to fight with me   202.77473166222734
only as our gascon was not easily intimidated or rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty   180.53750219255755
he was making rapid progress in italian   142.41563754938014
did i not tell you i wished for one   76.5511340306123
he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres   139.0387378097809
3   238.17937828119975
then i will add two words about the young greek girl   27.167904072350296
in august we lost 300 000 francs at the beginning of the month but on the 13th we made up for it and we now find that our accounts reckoning from the first day of partnership up to yesterday when i closed them showed a capital of 2 400 000 francs that is 1 200 000 for each of us   76.54395664873317
when i wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to i go to sleep   81.07120375738367
shall we see you again to give us any information   126.1295082797058
you are jesting   266.63873050845007
at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings   192.94688335898252
cried mousqueton the man you upset is getting up   203.87649142606585
certain dantès could not escape the gendarmes released him   133.2394737546165
notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers d artagnan felt completely solitary   153.71520458467666
but you told me the island was uninhabited   216.0727503219477
the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo and we will go another   179.9205051513488
why he is a second ariosto   47.59788798746776
she was a charming woman of twenty five or twenty six years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and opal   218.80377642633147
no   231.73536610792488
come and help me   31.449429784579095
the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and d artagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m   161.4227199438637
noirtier s weakness of mind sufficiently explains it   125.93010813871794
useless to look   108.96842378342055
noirtier   129.52816478861357
took an active part in the return from elba   88.02217594781402
the most satisfactory part of the matter said d artagnan is that there remains no trace of it   83.08284922863135
said caderousse   249.43307440944864
where is he   128.75859695050238
he became curious to solve the problem   47.29048726677611
your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak   75.6026196280934
at the first sight of his old friend danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy chair   129.12588779507513
he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear   118.62663670387631
we have met him twice at general cromwell s   90.57690206952873
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them   175.56587360526197
all was over she had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish   60.364703966600786
go to selim   99.16117440464711
said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain   136.42116161235137
we have seen plenty of dead men in our time   103.05112010696479
and he tapped gently at the door   69.74766641435133
we shall be driven by a state councillor   113.79023069282279
bertuccio said the count springing lightly up the three steps of the portico   204.78427934067952
the abbé took it and in return gave caderousse the diamond   210.35682881698926
come dear d artagnan look up a little   88.93612010054214
grimaud answered in four   85.07968813402786
he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field   98.12409805773697
you think so porthos   221.69866421537145
how was that   161.40098492116672
he cried   78.75203290366491
ah sir exclaimed madame de villefort clasping her hands what do you say   210.30544444631266
i had only to cry out help   157.30012338617885
i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there   30.518103015962524
de villefort has just confirmed   133.838321534156
then you think you will some day leave it   197.05552208384955
said de winter cunningly   231.70487323355582
no high sounding words   125.29881042604661
none   38.056422168312025
her face as she looked at athos had taken on an expression that can not be described   125.49457345004453
a moment said d artagnan   179.1595339382823
at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room   63.84323160572673
at half past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day   217.61028125009963
the king   159.17107313525497
but by this evening there will be four   109.47684542871464
our good d artagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye   153.6650134724611
he broke it   29.303651904501805
dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellow sufferer to share his supper   96.09414302617127
the soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away   104.4365646734144
benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced   159.08675900498946
certainly said morrel i am at your service count   35.8142141887522
the novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said don t you know a gentleman named athos   117.96808815842871
aramis again presented himself at the bishop s   106.97473680330765
i was the first to discover duprez at naples and the first to applaud him   20.76100223734194
30339m the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamore tree in the centre of the clump   80.17188416268056
he was wounded in his self love he thought that it was in his love   16.15049922819972
really   39.07350205009979
you knew it and said nothing   30.546168531759974
i merely await your commands   136.6035038201564
they called upon him then to retire   100.1707511392095
it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children   94.98440214835131
they are coming full gallop   128.9809316706494
what advantage should i have over you if knowing your secret i were to tell you mine   252.38883430726986
the prince was said to be in person at bethune   179.79343615337797
a learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality   86.86114623095483
you would do so   275.5322913273533
i know not   11.02417068450373
d artagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through   109.34612807037631
go to   89.85872208458316
e below   24.48312216711932
but edmond s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head   121.16065754423074
what are you looking at   119.12155265451797
but should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be displeased   175.67648475169912
the carmelite convent at béthune great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes them surmount all obstacles which makes them escape all dangers up to the moment which a wearied providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes   137.43118286892457
the president is speaking to the king   114.08555359088227
the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it   105.38002479728493
d artagnan   196.65777926090166
aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls   174.98057841479977
noirtier again closed his left eye   114.02998276394415
i should never have the courage to come down again   87.36187868433419
let us see said athos   87.01302107134299
and where is he now   135.84569843794594
but she is dead and my duty regards the living   166.6492424869724
maximilian morrel captain of spahis   88.64458238641505
but allow me to say that you must have been very young then   113.93395617259567
by eight o clock in the morning he was at the apartment of athos   181.70852618659399
that was proved at the trial since i was only condemned to the galleys   91.28040176482563
the felucca is waiting for us you know   160.0481215758973
are you not aware that this italian directs everything both indoors and out   105.39996407448203
you are still growing athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth   146.90640149021797
i was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of la réserve the day before i was to marry you a man named danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman fernand himself posted   78.86271485118513
that is it   119.62921958664165
ah   87.03510649555862
the duke thanked monsieur de chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawing paper for him   139.79656679688304
five thousand francs   97.54373020438526
d artagnan had fallen into an ambush   77.3119111765227
exclaimed albert   11.054790541046941
i fancy i hear horses feet   90.28356867152398
milady had stabbed herself   173.7474036811988
bernouin shut the door and went away   82.27769560205876
a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper   104.69006541115333
said morrel   188.3959725809118
it has hesitated at nothing in the past   69.59913167889087
a sob was the only sound he heard   172.90487368275797
villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off   113.43145515828374
it is his voice   103.90190427168291
the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject   200.99638256781884
what can i say more   140.89685428633217
it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you   123.46521312344905
much monsieur mordaunt would care   145.49733338661895
the bedclothes were thrown back exposing the king s bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen   66.25995466243478
replied la ramee   149.25281174371156
it was only a precaution   64.69429683870607
you are the offended party count   126.83219780077134
so you see my lord since i am hungry i would with your highness s leave and la ramee bent low   195.6610261443464
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist   147.5366019673275
then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to part   103.0268831924246
de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips   153.5251469065194
it was about one of those purchases that interest women a purchase by which much might have been gained   72.1086808043795
what do you prescribe doctor   225.3548050487218
this promise completed poor kitty s consolation   167.69000420057034
i have then to inform you sir at the request of m   95.17481293473736
oh   146.3935415977757
but i have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations   170.32485550763838
they gave them three hours rest and then set off again   158.85419814497305
i saw notwithstanding the darkness a shadow which approached my bed   121.54480749747536
at least so d artagnan declared to himself   140.02055557281028
as for my wife i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france   94.78646548551886
laporte pointed to the child who was asleep   68.79390311116316
but then your word is given   147.37096706646108
you will return alone then   166.73716578304567
that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eugénie as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed   105.29407492882824
debray smiled   95.82151494616235
immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it   98.97783304748823
an affair for the police   194.0260758392387
that was the name which the traveller gave to vampa as his own   71.66750903358167
the lackey bowed and let them pass   143.6000868941926
must i always be the same   96.42472622114923
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them   105.0902493831984
grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river within a hundred paces of a ferry   104.38718964990215
are you ambitious   140.69469163950365
lord   115.92186061473446
the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the abbé faria had spread the riches of his mind   30.36577611402855
and he extended his hands toward grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him   84.0385638578691
the outlook was sad   179.8440028692201
follow me said an officer who came up behind the guards   102.65852693900264
certainly replied the officer and left the room   147.81889903996617
i know nothing about it myself   162.46171811948727
and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of it   71.3878708023874
asked porthos   15.99131462446475
ah that is something said albert   174.5547411230762
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitic he was in prison   26.654283272941015
and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe   188.46811269849388
sleeplessness inflamed my eyes   129.60642344816043
the storm still continued   120.4505222677038
but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis   99.34497797605565
you can not beat me said he   87.06926449324112
that did not come from a man without a heart   31.207649075435796
the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison   162.68802569651973
madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall   68.19783122200053
what you count   49.042658510414995
you wish to destroy yourself said the count   58.15228499417467
morrel reflected   96.08345660074177
he was discovered   182.51393431800403
and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly   154.47529347811803
as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions   124.28849434076656
is he not a singing boy at notre dame   186.0282145828733
but to die   187.17322256234672
ah reverend sir cried caderousse clasping his hands and drawing nearer to monte cristo i may indeed say you are my deliverer   142.3435776564193
you have seen him   68.06851764654513
valery   151.3195519877071
you don t love me   136.6864537195545
how much do you require for my ransom   238.4594514483029
but i heard the noise of breaking furniture   73.88471318315838
that time you had nothing to say to me   59.321708914145624
it may have arrived since i left my office   37.77933371543503
why   27.013527055233567
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time   133.22672638887195
the duke uttered a cry but grimaud did not give a single moan   146.16771093820205
it is well   72.57868607339513
think of it madame he said   94.20185829954411
by a tailor a coachmaker a brewer   138.2702518833928
he said   22.10649361209721
when i ring once it is for my valet   70.01681521505938
this woman passed for his sister   52.25655943459583
d artagnan was at the height of joy   89.92687764511702
certainly my dear sir   112.5334196029352
but while they were watching the departure of the count morrel had quitted his post and château renaud failing in his search joined debray and beauchamp   149.2064019792914
but was it my father s ring   99.31779864651162
cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo fair paulet it is high time to put little voiture in his right place   98.09876056442316
you know i used to be a good cook   22.59721507269066
and do you know this gentleman monsieur   88.72030126808416
without me you would both have died   215.33218268247117
i give you a thousand chances   17.735597098473647
speak out my friend   208.16481523768712
said my enemy in a jeering tone that s quite another thing   143.4251003749419
felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture   199.23191206487724
they employ him because they are afraid of him   111.61281242677141
and have you replied to everyone as you have to me   30.040549550558183
have you not perceived it   140.26983551783093
limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from   190.33506457928655
albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble   27.275877734730216
she had a son that unhappy woman   83.2663491443202
what queen   109.42369004941862
since she lodges with him   174.90189536073197
but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron   144.51895537321218
and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three o clock and that i request permission to introduce someone to her   75.62184650842974
the queen smiled   198.44313950281924
oh sir   138.40729430073225
you need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain   185.77230830052682
strength and sagacity   135.89130754496077
i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek   89.47164981828915
a part of the good abbé s words however were wholly incomprehensible to him   178.85873339002376
if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost   154.92157701421795
i have devoted myself to industry   208.90419561586071
but this annoys you   181.19928269481363
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomas du louvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men   8.198066984554544
but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness   135.7671779214715
i really never heard a person speak as you do   123.13331974938792
milady showed her the cardinal s order   67.45906533811515
the chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to hyères for a week   113.67343939304511
so that i have no society   1.462526818826646
not so for it is religious replied aramis   140.77393698887823
ah but madame does mankind ever lose anything   137.83081605936297
here s a louis that smells confoundedly of straw   100.64991498226105
it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat   117.4416884857237
he said this madame mazarin is a stumbling block   131.28924116585262
where is there any to be found   44.26282800986142
four   212.36152170067567
who is speaking of monsieur d artagnan   72.12866600129483
then you had better come with me   113.35414592252525
planchet d artagnan s valet supported his good fortune nobly   86.08325270772346
and why today rather than yesterday or tomorrow   22.532141111757483
he gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he waited   110.61115461465796
d artagnan saw that the moment was come   86.18410119994554
debray you are a connoisseur i believe let me have your opinion upon them   95.81371570756397
cried d artagnan pale with terror   115.87383899395996
m   119.3919686036961
salute my hero viscount   109.37685203354603
without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it for all my tears my cares my exile and my chains i have my youth my prayers and god who counts my pains   135.24509295002673
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial   160.30026378296245
he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor   173.44793393722287
i have a party at my house tonight and therefore can not possibly remain till the end of the opera   257.71544479183046
yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse   140.91678163818472
that would be a misfortune said de winter and i shall begin to think that we are really doomed   26.858762469272563
here is his letter said d artagnan and he presented the note to his comrades   74.40096460166873
you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo to drive round the walls and re enter by the porta san giovanni   172.97326404681948
well a fowl fish game it signifies little so that i eat   108.2326791456208
but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood   42.87183922882609
i i detest i loathe it   222.5078015627447
what do you want sir   81.21814768587768
but the reverse is the case   163.9774611769831
yes   111.73784567245028
everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future   182.16849047000014

on the contrary from a firm conviction   59.85099708630905
ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are   85.43209623058644
he stretched forth his hand and touched stone   66.97733178247336
we will grow old together and talk of our companions   16.258017983673156
ah   71.26310740059611
as you please   61.301088826453466
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind   188.89113241753557
and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm   152.2700855339735
morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance   109.5789326521083
he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary   92.43459857770866
go and fetch a physician   158.4598361291264
but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday   87.67913102728343
these two gentlemen shall decide between us   119.46303697316009
for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to lord de winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queen s carriage had left the court   7.904200690485965
and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards   84.54215448156639
charge   92.45339511737794
but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow   125.86363974381656
my brother killed him   105.56826711604309
then i will go to the governor of algeria   221.41052547106622
the roll call continued   39.329663232800584
well la ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that i shall try them   92.04726111865816
exactly so   116.18293107759908
the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet   53.37464969186303
it was like the first empty   120.98440605585799
the day after monte cristo had called upon danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten o clock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon   61.76259174754723
la ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience   37.454271059417394
who goes there yourselves   100.12856518362511
when he arrives i will not fail to do so   82.04079059762196
no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found   161.88328281191102
it is he who sold us   129.42703242041986
the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction   160.45933000178394
in the first place i have as a precaution shut up at rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable ones   23.989618499516922
reflect morcerf one moment before you go   107.2824564562359
and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success   124.4123560129489
the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done   8.522123692739058
exclaimed groslow   60.41457826871937
i can just suit you   196.67367825600144
say one word to them and all will be ended peace succeed war joy tears and happiness to misfortune   106.59791299210286
oh yes yes   119.23249848337737
andrea cavalcanti the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room which baptistin had designated as the drawing room and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously   67.98536521648975
what is this   113.04925582216568
please follow me and he went on before followed by athos and aramis   121.36543370153169
very well   109.79584711600818
let us separate and let us seek the mercer s wife that is the key of the intrigue   108.290213953922
replied d artagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant   45.56825807780302
yes said caderousse   139.59865037621822
there in the salon   121.10451285341821
madeleine s brother entered d artagnan s service   84.1397507165473
i had it   101.147340776521
we have arranged the ransom of each of them 2 000 on arriving in france   134.09296349347372
chapter xxv   53.10041012819026
and what are you afraid of then   173.53120191928207
the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m   136.43510548413238
during this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease   136.88250146242606
they went out   92.71027693450702
and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded market place   124.78414106053822
have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire   117.09800065788816
it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs   131.15131276133428
remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that i do so   132.06443977182084
monsieur de bouillon had the gout but notwithstanding his illness which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last month that is since paris had been besieged he was ready to receive the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay   75.82890832917178
asked richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance   88.07133606942584
porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand in   250.47211942624725
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces   99.55670928947076
in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man   87.30463017185482
our family although still rich for my father s income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence   51.11771670001863
he cocked his gun and laid it beside him   0.7607606890401257
you must do so   210.31017841566285
oh returned she it was a gift of heaven   26.95282367548731
sometimes on a sunday i take a ride in the fields and on the property of my neighbours in order to pick up a nice little quarrel which i am really in want of but nothing happens   83.63425721947354
de saint méran   118.00644556989482
how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested   130.08051477150505
take it said she and be accursed   106.75970777463398
this as you know is the important point of distinction between the covenanter and the cavalier   69.82722005682314
she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down   81.30906156556415
but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them   130.47869977407635
not if the choice had remained with me for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts   131.88750163400576
no pity for him who had no pity   105.83478223578493
do you know athos   169.53020685359203
you have my promise he said after a minute s pause extending his hand to monte cristo   91.31187292536109
you might find it dull   94.99360267778277
the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand put his lips to it and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine he spat the liquor into the fireplace   133.78484328371724
de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art   171.9559847214789
all three have left the service   58.328224874238146
oh how feverish you are   108.58880645168045
all three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools   90.03116856683371
gentlemen said d artagnan addressing the guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place   97.0620113226983
there were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant   117.9983768879446
come said d artagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our journey   183.49588923952206
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you   220.05975063812195
yes replied the man but at what a price   253.31457673083787
if these are spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought d artagnan we shall yet be able to do business together   27.506237539548593
the night chapter 90   94.3435325285092
but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness   120.88778914699151
opposite the tower of london he found the vessel that had been named to him delivered his letter to the captain who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to sail   178.7888365639993
no no look look   107.78814793777822
now i am going to show you how sincere i am   112.34813620812946
the way was opened for you unexpectedly   165.89464521566202
and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied   75.80557134682195
i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandy for instance between le havre and boulogne   191.1834936166315
you are coming my boy   23.929628697766205
cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said morrel   154.56789538767478
madame bonacieux was released   97.24861170243352
here is a creature that loves me   61.1832918864053
oh poor woman poor woman   82.4840498069124
impossible   111.89970876804446
three months afterwards a woman travelled from rogliano to paris to fetch me and having claimed me as her son carried me away   144.76709383631137
this is a detail preserved to us by brienne   89.75456038877905
because don carlos has fled from bourges and has returned to spain   140.00624608707798
de winter turned and followed the direction of aramis s finger   123.2022935332635
how is it all the better   88.96709629254343
madame said albert allow me to present to you m   10.108710669231101
i want you to be approved   144.0506999646006
it means replied mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that our parts are changed and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners i am theirs   130.77780177905595
he said   91.33682318883416
yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for i found them ugly enough to frighten me   21.9330302055931
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared   137.88138840184524
oh i will find it he cried   137.52231472745572
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of d artagnan   53.564386854782384
this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking it   78.3570113401361
at ten o clock anne of austria had entered the king s room   193.72738897848302
he knew her well enough in all cases to know that whether acting for or against him as a friend or an enemy she would not remain motionless without great impediments   156.7771859655972
de guémené   152.03461706486212
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do   105.22484714884105
and passes his time   148.64981276170596
30183m what do you say   90.19505746841992
i knight you monsieur le comte   184.96693611328215
the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back   64.7552110844336
you would not then prefer a method resumed d artagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless   96.95699735226435
d artagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge   148.46726609626128
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god   38.85350982246159
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutor s harangue   4.221944454093503
the blade was round and of flexible silver   164.67688747895403
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting   177.49228420581554
asked aramis   143.35925859602534
then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers   77.03554921659439
morrel to aid dantès he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection   138.52921933861168
her eye alone lived and glared horribly   143.1802581998859
the duc de chatillon commanded the centre   179.05146865586386
asked dantès of himself   94.53742393212644
then taking up his account book he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away   119.70708663833383
and of what did he die   214.65854923503
is there any difficulty in the way   159.74328929386942
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte cattini   219.54670815062929
believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own   156.17698605835614
what reason do you assign   193.75815601192778
you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing   59.28314416456601
the reader may ask how came planchet here   124.86529961505492
the man was caderousse he was pale and his shirt was all bloody   149.5156399618724
franz and i have to thank you a thousand times count returned albert   99.86020148779365
i will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example   100.70332997412581
i wish to speak with monsieur aramis   58.23546261759234
this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch   146.46292285581072
what   125.41376317666307
everything was in readiness   127.1127025943845
the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release   117.61859558881294
had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300 000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25 000   87.95919574116012
sign it   112.00166843535179
be calm exclaimed athos for heaven s sake   154.73916574619915
she speculated and lost   118.89304745545832
he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate   105.28635385035258
only imagine what happiness that would afford me   21.992123540013665
alas no my lord   247.6543272836994
here is the sea   156.01314415525448
there s the sun   176.439223932661
he was waiting for me at nine at the barrière de fontainebleau   78.36108183061049
louis xviii   83.1361319182987
already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht   110.88262050436617
hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone   167.5836409324721
aramis because you are a knight of malta and won t mix with fellows like us   132.97118014728846
are they going to put him in the ministry   155.14339452422337
be of good cheer replied dantès   194.94389712933074
my husband was a great friend in 1814 or 1815 of a sailor named edmond dantès   68.65646706447811
you have done for me as you promised all that you could do   72.07635156797025
the tall man alone inhabited this house   214.8956627172227
yes replied monte cristo these blazons prove that   38.29228381416162
have you ever seen the tuileries   109.82791611773007
what is it then   154.21587948132935
the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away   185.272930785337
e   170.8271644435192
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink   184.68626723044213
said madame de villefort selecting a new point of attack   87.65669486568598
to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them   218.86131375427436
you approve of him   135.677976772232
i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own   49.05181910128728
at last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness   71.59395875661455
that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience and the mob retired   109.1853299396943
madame where do you keep the poison you generally use   47.49314300132431
an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door   113.52483786874139
on the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death   174.70035384030797
d artagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door   56.857239831565565
madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release broussel   114.91753552613636
cried d artagnan you could not have arrived in better time   175.0179705898465
they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them   140.77750945820796
franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example   130.4753892124557
but i repeat it again to you replied felton in great emotion no danger threatens you   190.4923828893035
mademoiselle mademoiselle   115.40198809373739
athos lifted his finger and grimaud was silent   153.27031040216303
then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value   102.36847379555893
but what shall i wear   158.25558781606742
ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all   206.47656817787055
it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot   138.3003737221372
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him   45.91492888221177
none my lord   44.595909470495144
yesterday i said this mass again   242.67806158173238
de villefort said the king come in   173.72108724230435
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage   213.00172872863595
for the comte de la fère it is too little   157.4277643769342
i too as happens to every man once in his life have been taken by satan into the highest mountain in the earth and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world and as he said before so said he to me child of earth what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me   80.48357503502136
let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob   151.35246161764894
that is likely said d artagnan   61.51842566016854
in the meantime please to sit down monsieur and i will fetch you some refreshment   13.61308418056808
i have been made a baron so that i actually am one   102.06472576961554
all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard   174.73353624696318
he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me   201.92738581582265
what shall we do   53.992617685539656
so they united against him and hanged him on a tree   146.90037356508645
no no do not be deceived   89.40161787086282
what is it   68.54377170092695
i did   98.16623807222228
let us go said she i place full confidence in you my friend   159.80100959385356
and then dantès countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies   153.89473386194902
take the best horse you can find   64.44644537099693
but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune   193.1054502433719
my dear bazin said d artagnan i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church   76.3155589608204
my cassock is fastened by one button only and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more   124.4397486811759
after that i ceased to blaspheme but i cursed my father   137.2882233214235
de tréville the elegant and noble courtier athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison   164.44506248052264
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon   146.96070818153635
you who speak english like john bull himself are master tom lowe we your three companions   265.68973633183134
she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty   133.0771281140997
protect her for the count s voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world   90.53658252721004
of certain expenses he has contracted   62.271658140836756
all at once a tall dark gentleman just like yours d artagnan   213.97484195253327
was asked a second time   197.41352706188405
when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodière he arrived at m   180.49012479631918
i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses   57.48912365556936
and he pointed his gun at d artagnan who was riding toward him at full speed   99.48646902641411
who the beggar was that i killed   272.57848077023397
truly athos interrupted d artagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of   68.08151758825798
the king   162.48053451549686
well sir replied eugénie i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible   36.5679892904856
oh no said the gardener   174.24593772037582
monsieur d artagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in a hollow tone   134.34235791790465
a doctor   172.86186966909122
the two men followed the company and on leaving the faubourg st   190.28195265551207
returned d artagnan   116.1027576828798
the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her   89.33790901649252
there was more than benevolence in this action   73.3881168905416
the jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire la carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest   104.5161084266598
look out for the black fowls   112.27326681271784
and i also have reflected   66.73519036708151
sdeath   133.73739425910793
the violins began to sound with all their might but nobody listened to them   179.75213786195832
the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired   43.700600833623724
because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the lady   23.774561222345426
shall you not go with the queen   116.27580958483574
said caderousse   0.8536103541159434
de tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news   59.028647987480824
ah very well   79.14512128560199
porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the king   90.97653109971267
where the devil then is he   150.96081384187767
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime   89.94566520264121
he wouldn t listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallows bird   188.33310392090465
there s luck my lord   155.89742885431843
i have not your confidence   4.609764285334279
with two companions   26.957102122834613
de tréville   174.65317830674377
you have to do with that woman   53.050879318136936
that may be madame   126.12682807077414
you have a good memory sir to recollect dates so well   162.623404955505
au revoir benedetto   43.5091242360884
asked m   30.38239188812446
beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days   5.223642999617837
that is to say with our enemies   95.251773121937
what is the matter sir   56.45876737524724
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover   99.56021981776793
well signor pastrini said franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi vampa   28.780662005555214
at eleven o clock came in his turn duhallier captain of the guards bringing with him fifty archers who were distributed immediately through the hôtel de ville at the doors assigned them   153.19222220114293
and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites   158.96658575357694
alas   178.67095031701206
i countenance nothing that is marvellous m   116.88034878596063
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the count s stopped before the hôtel de londres   105.98622917010813
but when they touched him although under jacopo s directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved   137.19635501039
he has become an abbé that is all   143.39831583934915
what do you think of the plan gentlemen   108.68425672478449
de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume   198.38494671082688
they attracted his admiration   85.02272431503732
still you have thought of it   63.66161435964603
tis well   214.61780043234123
but you who must know that i am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will   111.61156497120955
you have insulted a defenseless man   117.86718866329538
by the way m   184.928934339553
he recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard   86.00871844242096
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below   85.33965519291594
the young man s eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself   147.12750615702797
indeed no said château renaud   43.23849231772387
should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are saved   110.26704296037931
it is too gracious   219.66613260264054
that s my great disadvantage   115.44535203931379
the wife and daughter of charles i   86.91835600730968
they found raoul near his tent reclining on a truss of hay of which his horse stole some mouthfuls   12.532931037317326
let them come in   91.65874745181486
it was you who finding the balls had missed their mark sent poisoned wine with a forged letter to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends   161.5844181834358
said anne of austria   68.99229911620154
here we are without occupation it seems to me   161.78908922959457
the four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of athos dominated all the rest   73.39626924257306
undoubtedly the call came from faria s dungeon   198.7546316846319
said d artagnan   38.28114580541744
he is admirably adapted to revive one s spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters   109.82689418334084
think of that valentine   157.82985862932549
a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour   179.20316861741682
sharpen your sword baron load your pistols and give some corn to the horses for i will answer for it something lightning like will happen ere to morrow   42.42774480586233
d artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself   115.85241647099257
5 where lord wilmore lived   191.39480826110193
madame de saintot has hastened to him with broth   161.72081591450814
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick   179.76953431433046
he had despaired of finding bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end   98.58500776489936
i spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place   0.16271204847022602
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation   85.43494539214105
barrois made some steps towards his master   146.0336209392569
and how many were there of these linen drapers   176.90754700932013
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones   137.21185493412608
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton   69.48565336613049
constance   222.1239667789937
but his quickness was not of much use to him   100.45536998419806
then turning to mazarin now my lord let us enter if you please   120.90110070097663
and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles   67.56884289316349
for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this mazarin would have you hanged   191.02466840352923
morbleu   222.58613651149642
it was therefore near seven o clock   87.25040651658678
i do not say i regret   102.52630180100381
30297m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count   121.29019221207228
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry   209.97324815490254
villefort perceiving the abbé passed his hand across his brow   66.64484491689988
before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife   46.2336577604902
all this will be cleared up at a later period murmured the young woman   41.780299511038606
if i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal   153.29398002467602
but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin   24.549948654060955
the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera   184.1127422519105
have what you will   85.84035881517514
oh   79.9362690571294
but what i know is that i will not be perjured   194.49830231237001
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you   82.95245593504818
he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said s accommodi   143.40620150345856
at this moment he will have left elba to go whither i know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples or on the coast of tuscany or perhaps on the shores of france   150.73050156212793
was the cry in every direction   127.75696068760062
that is well   186.53088136135716
you say so   81.0242269457216
i will proclaim the violence you have used toward me   118.50278960518462
you are the directors of all consciences   117.14021216020483
this is the second or third time monsieur that you have repeated that name and yet i have told you that i do not know him   116.41724728771187
said m   61.14334938941013
she worries me in england as well as in france said athos   7.336589088517243
ah   124.87873969714836
d artagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend porthos   121.61489679571346
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactor then count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend   125.03935977196011
in the meantime follow me   60.00375518197577
at one moment bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light which illumined the sea for the space of a league they might each be seen each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which even in their hearts of bronze they could not help experiencing   52.30627466604358
than the son of peter mazarin   192.1643646454388
it is arranged capitally   64.12603496654185
and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age   166.13112288416647
i sailed for the island of elba where i arrived the next day   65.10122025478148
to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de méré or a vitry   127.51060462654402
and you what are you doing here   75.03128178682306
the young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance   113.66824950888244
not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young man   45.0370708285854
he wished bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of m   188.53366297938356
then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said i wish you joy my lord   199.6599066773913
then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to m   78.06959069572062
you see   158.41654473502768
nay be not discouraged   62.6132164633503
let him come   132.24490034839104
yes sir   42.89807755427165
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted   153.0219332732416
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me   72.73447439392666
said fernand   133.1954526486918
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck   55.22760776466245
séguier keeper of the seals looks more than once for the bell it is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made upon louis xiii   172.4856244489049
i shall rely on it   50.64239746542232
he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you   122.73760888189248
but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest   142.93844526061963
they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache   92.61148624664168
then you love me   124.19460624197146
asked milady sharply   192.12756535494603
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses   113.48940498235234
oh i declare to you felton i thought him mad   100.20484463663786
i am afraid he has turned out ill she added   63.87532297960509
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise   145.96272128863538
where is the letter you speak of   220.47034834924176
marie michon and what dream does she mean   137.22373256808524
i also was married at the death bed of my mother and certainly i have not been less happy on that account   122.89832967572431
cried valentine calling her step mother and running upstairs to meet her   69.44109304537821
but as la jeune amélie had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to leghorn   184.05685872953993
on d artagnan s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life s disillusions   47.16816526682062
but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family   95.60575765300618
lean a little to the left   131.1161124381332
there said he there is the work complete   164.03001658490788
i had fixed the embarkation for the twenty fourth   214.77499623763768
and i also i was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke   156.318976858175
only their wish to see each other had become a necessity and they would have preferred death to a day s separation   208.18214239024786
then for the present m   131.26928307271305
now said he the sacrifice is consummated   77.2668502555234
9 when they tell me such things i only shrug my shoulders and say nothing   70.16951185788584
crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear   85.27533284162783
of milady de winter replied d artagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence   122.89335283099992
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one   183.4993014073515
alas i have them no longer   114.56712563823628
you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone   100.11865778263052
yes you are at once from provence and spain   138.1850626205271
come this way   7.134508486541762
two o clock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour   89.72636051294162
are they capable of attempting violence   142.89819634650024
how inscrutable are the ways of providence for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased   85.82082046009697
it is mine monsieur chevalier   102.5221093346233
precautions   62.36457255398348
felton reappeared and without observing whether milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready spread   62.208789545375204
and where   81.49555635501721
there is everything in a jesuit convent   67.2985451675694
see   122.43248529098258
and not without a deal of trouble too   228.27666046124324
i can do much for you my friend replied the count   109.60676449914477
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier   129.35935098753558
in the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs roman laws and frank usages   153.9059833080855
the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag   178.846364908518
monte cristo then was in league with his father s enemies   96.35123545862183
albert understood his thoughts   62.55971775020744
ah you fellows are good managers   116.0960473928365
but the water was icy cold   111.6257745535251
and why was i arrested   33.51930358276688
but instead of that you come to paris   232.28762738372535
at this moment barrois entered   64.69184532093425
soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice   28.173580585671886
since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he belonged   73.50433643082508
the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim   109.30285319812857
by no means   160.310432818447

the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal   190.03238795995304
cried d artagnan   49.91669563997118
half the camp was at the barrier   178.11810612184738
thus all my opinions i will not say public but private are confined to these three sentiments i love my father i respect m   86.00183910611977
cried de blacas   70.15704945804566
no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters   83.25521821266557
you know the axiom non bis in idem   57.72972650938623
then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time   169.65201126605388
d artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale   109.95892636988262
we should be hard to please if we were not   17.048385971065997
twenty guards well mounted are all that i shall need for my escort   132.28729973227246

we must understand each other said the duke   193.03962193725226
the coast owing to the gascon s stratagem was clear   170.39968873477022
the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist   229.14121073182937
but when i did so the shade disappeared   37.628761318026065
what do you think of the story chalais s esquire relates   113.75007970097404
albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from beauchamp s confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence   30.4558262279901
he opened his arms and haydée uttering a cry sprang into them   185.66109955817623
inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his look   48.97921657510561
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression   79.21125793321247
in a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun s genial influence when the cloud has passed   67.91743700349595
he muttered whence comes this thought   69.87250139369937
tell me what is the matter   119.82496215607642
thou hast done well   145.15417308926084
but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage   138.00925633501782
that count of monte cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night   91.85947559470901
madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon   135.4564037456058
corbleu   64.9011879085429

raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little louise whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten   123.69561748542226
aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a dark blue cloak of a military cut   26.155624885737012
pardieu   47.2614013978056
this permission we feel bound to say was graciously granted   18.118808964767382
oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on   126.10609615123941
of what   94.7724123433494
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice   99.70215124742734
how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands   100.8354539318056
it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within a timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard   32.29059618600766
there it is cried the jesuit   152.13830042286662

that is to say patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks   127.36267149816521
it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together   123.59150957073386
or rather we are very clever said d artagnan   81.38432126790897
remember that i loved you   163.08489017542178
it contains the number of my new abode   42.13167865539573
from a certain abbé busoni   121.94418083725368

and now monsieur d artagnan he said prepare to set off for saint germain and take a letter from me to the queen   87.29616040589366
what is his name   214.11571151025913
no tomorrow   177.4661584343747
athos was the last to enter   117.9596657307162
very well let us say no more about it   122.64318194795351
and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements   35.7163992209981
how did danglars usually write   71.51461795160618
cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing   301.8434527524656
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison   85.93550454360275
i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression   29.521247932050642
la ramee became therefore the duke s dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper the shadow of his person   115.71529368284938
there remained athos and d artagnan   75.68044204125127
well my faith   204.51829197502883
drink this and then take nothing more tonight   154.080416879618
nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or ill fated mother   87.88490776869286
indeed   67.79560121672094
but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony   257.2862896874251
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose   135.393707623
and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock   77.85856556142551
while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each   128.9003774780601
not at all my young man   95.23808112019931
but that with with   38.64378193421963
are become our most dangerous enemies athos   88.35815595726987
d artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on planchet s horse   29.444754829850808

and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear   212.02149919715194
but he wears my livery   92.69847544804352
last of all came the governor   148.3196770113967
hair sandy red more red than sandy   79.52347103033455
stay said monte cristo as though he had not observed her confusion i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds   188.76231194917293
if you reveal it to anyone in the world i shall be lost and perhaps yourself likewise   142.45401169203203
with paris the bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein   98.05997131482074
well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that i am his neighbor   83.64866957078821
to learn is not to know   107.44647273213474

the jailer stared   84.78408621351046
then here is my master s card the baron danglars   131.35538637625282
i have sometimes thought as you do athos   95.86530331946332
she is quite well replied danglars quickly   108.98388886572363
50093m you are mistaken sir exclaimed morrel raising himself on one knee his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt you are mistaken   35.47280672969842
a small vessel with an english crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of charente at fort la pointe   117.00432161696601
absolutely   40.718106370368346
i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him but perhaps it was too late   205.61836681177022
if he tells the baron said she i am lost for the baron who knows very well that i shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but acted   123.65848906095985
oh continue   69.34890118903394
it was in fact mordaunt whom d artagnan had followed without knowing it   78.78263726871143
and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face   282.9476853677145
this order was also executed   29.59423500898606
and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan   124.13317736210237
his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he was   145.43420986993058
as these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their heads in sign of assent   75.37508763247676
look   243.7882033791414
awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressing gown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames   93.28513983772686
planchet began to sing un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin   153.16485048453103
all our servants are busy discussing the grand affair   74.01584565299339
oh sir if you know who this man is cried d artagnan tell me who he is and whence he is   168.75319080798525
those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them   167.8154098966421
felton himself might now be watched   256.6769995600597
a terrible fear transfixed him   36.845082267524674
in the midst of this seeming hilarity nevertheless people s minds were uneasy   174.723179305436
bonacieux we shall hear no more   50.521400562249326
well thought d artagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my fault for it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage   204.50037664184254
oh no monsieur replied monte cristo   175.94215152758983

among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance   170.83860659839206
three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fish pond   122.71512943190572
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony   148.42397430019034
in fact as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit   61.96994402248855
without accident   101.66627637233594
it is like that turkish phrase of molière s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance   154.09635375814557
you condemned me to a horrible tedious death   103.04964434127587
who s there   177.94682850766856
but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them   59.67311395328724
my dear count said albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory   160.42824393134563
the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti   177.22897475152095
for he said nothing and did much   159.18227318776195
when i ask you if you are consoled i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets   144.95175464822975
yes pretty well   144.60183729660847
on whom does my bleeding heart repose   103.79931371429387
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep   75.20406401308645
let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone   143.3657068935507
within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you   69.17386687923916
marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the shoulders   132.95921957623017
today her delirium is almost madness   194.32095560536476
yes   117.06632979179233
athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality   153.9083230821995

the walls were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the dead   44.83642682332642
is it possible   109.47780497788723
de blacas will go and find my messenger   97.60673489822531

de château renaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all over that is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemart took albert s hand   99.9212238607256
and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors   75.75569756705391
from time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer   145.8807467509379
besides when that note is delivered in all probability you will have no more to fear   100.76608124454754

besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which la jeune amélie replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come   158.56069500481652
besides it will not be for long   53.79475268128935
he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain   61.69167358161702

mousqueton trembled   128.8316265139079
the duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read my dear duke you may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note   139.42468476749264
i will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself   192.66932076389614

the family had all retired to rest but villefort who alone remained up and worked till five o clock in the morning reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates compiling the depositions of the witnesses and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered   9.723287624762818
his eminence asks for the letter said bernouin passing back into the ante chamber   144.62741805026303

the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg saint honoré and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen garden of about an acre   92.2332976008641
indeed said château renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one   80.76921538890434

but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie i saw you arranging a deposit is not that the term   33.45075879979288
only tell me how high up is your excavation   159.36607312129865
and mademoiselle d armilly said the banker   85.80164417301978
the monster was himself   57.10015903812732
the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility   97.32732344858655
there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallows bird   132.74705346092097
three of the four horses had already arrived   164.25599760245652
anne of austria at the age of forty six   155.89193137340163
he exclaimed   148.78974523682163
the foundation s ein or federal tax identification number is 64 6221541   81.56005315160995
to be a great chemist in the east one must direct chance   19.318659394403824
wretch   201.58041595481774
but what am i to do   75.6164651003889
has he not come   30.06208213911168
and he disappeared   71.044511895839
on my honor in one single throw   9.205417692635777
they asked   62.2470550583366
the drink deadened eye of athos flashed out but only for a moment   106.35235060891262
balzempleu   136.17723264351073
near the louvre the four friends met with m   125.18996164441711
do as i do   78.45850999653742
the blood rose to her head and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her robe   127.93575712119579
how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten   60.07427883248745
debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the minister and besides albert looked at his tablets it is the hour i told the count 21st may at half past ten   106.54525184311899
and he closed his eyes with a groan   57.36522972836091
bonacieux had made with him for that very evening   143.24591038273581
at daybreak i left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion asleep   87.5745102242873
the jest however soon appeared to become earnest   62.61124799526591
now he said are you in pain   70.02075293906276
so he only said that she had gone out with her step mother and that she should be fetched   73.54267579571066
a proof   31.1145071164524
and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard   111.84224059318687
asked monte cristo advancing to meet the commissioner   227.55474284267893
then turning to grimaud he said and thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me   71.87585450194362
he has seen him said athos in a low tone to aramis   104.06520845658073
then open the door directly   66.35070070559982
0081m you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken   162.00860829417817
remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your master s head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for you   163.52022974812684
go on   222.17490910798423
now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it   148.61711810377363
where do you live   148.52989149050634
it is surely not one of my friends   110.26978289581776
that will be another thing   87.76806068357831
but you will be resigned my friend   244.94110869241413
that would boom the market   32.100229783318326
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will   239.6302181731387
i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and can not in the least make out what it is about   146.86291296155534
a ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the dead   6.078212226406663
and since you know it there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not very patient so that when they have begged to be excused once were it even for a folly they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done   79.75705576917203
at ten o clock felton came and placed the sentinel   199.9304699826123
said gondy reflecting you are right sir   150.84192332473236
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from d artagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence   153.53855436156627
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse   107.29209564691493
baptistin appeared   177.54490585779337
alas   123.92376496208183
planchet   48.06215390974998
such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money   38.08336073000942
while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night   138.7271116533821
the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands   113.00611505372393
i am told that there is a general insurrection   101.03504338045238
passionately   60.065685101474784
i do not drink bazin pushed away with dignity the officer s hand tis good only for the laity   129.2975029601442
the young people uttered a cry of joy while maximilian raised his head but let it fall again immediately   65.76088946732999
yes yes replied mazarin   121.63807873104889
do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man   83.18892656795987
oh   117.18921483220532
de tréville went on prosperously   150.42376917340303
cried the jesuit   43.22834306910907
as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholics all in the name of religion he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic sometimes a huguenot   152.62450171209218
he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into prosperity   119.37909564039565
nevertheless they felt convinced that all was as it should be as it was done by the order of athos   124.15425590153184
the count   192.46541913727532
therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem   238.32541743487502
do not let me lose both my companions   181.65246436850487
morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission   207.6635280217915
château renaud and morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder   87.8376956477837
listen   176.98749340348314
chapter xi   101.33504631289168
morrel you are going to destroy yourself   118.05742854218292
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking it it was the noise of cannon   13.194975676121658
come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you   90.75395085174773
replied mousqueton   216.8471046572161
i have not the honor of knowing madame danglars   157.22258308410096
now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony   133.85300946053752
the father will never repay it   109.39691102914203
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside   154.53097855198115
you who are in power have only the means that money produces we who are in expectation have those which devotion prompts   91.0339461774589
but you must do the like for me   44.05724304898084
he understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to rome   253.16635627608883
was there not a marriage engagement between you and mademoiselle de saint méran   104.62677609216317
yes in so many words   155.24038508346177
well   128.7841202696686
said kitty   87.45053700421481
john lateran and peppino called rocca priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa and the men of his band   91.03626406668026
that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you   112.30323747024241
the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes   121.98115708277564
d artagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive   153.45105580422953
emmanuel go with them and see that my orders are executed   147.63492447786606
baptistin bowed   70.99286437353555
i speak only of an accident you understand of a mistake but whether accident or mistake the fact is there   132.59790719375513
but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness   93.65990870649118
exactly so   45.82147790585948
but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat   93.06226659156525
do i lose by that   105.11759716598215
nothing replied de winter   75.13743018438217
almost an impossibility replied the major   116.06982772373807
said the count to the veiled woman   36.690941819066495
d artagnan colored   186.15515860293738
he was shown monsieur de chavigny s watch   241.58816513697096
she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the thousand and one nights would seem but poverty   125.80355574265131
and is there no means of making him revoke his decision   97.7813863031664
no sir but i am severely   186.6909643392213
they had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the guards   171.37453437575454
no   150.84601827100852
i will run for it sir   230.21076056686985
i am ready   24.39640974073616
said the count the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech   263.5997442265764
but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos   91.95780418037084
diable   59.29188661207518
monsieur said d artagnan you must excuse famished travelers   133.62435365024334
toward six o clock d artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night   200.1235069528436
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their brother   112.4140433764796
have you admired the rapidity of my fall   52.59989243419484
after all continued d artagnan there was certainly one with aramis   200.13477091682975
yes as you see neighbor caderousse   30.917577630660517
and regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on   39.665152300375084
and so being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and rich and that is happiness sir why do you call me unhappy   53.40995400698608
he might go out by one gate and return by another   105.95062896405067
this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum   72.26828968676097
we are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of heaven   226.19083621911693
it was the count de rochefort   91.94675116949433
he complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to come deeds and power which none could thwart with impunity   156.1214036157938
i love the sea as a mistress and pine if i do not often see her   72.82163073543614
she is my betrothed   36.8338209128562
the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced   166.60002061055124
do you say asked the gascon timidly that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself   171.03471322221782
if your daughter had committed only one crime and i saw her meditating another i would say warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying   94.24217128854269
number 3 has two staircases inside and outside   152.8078003076935
he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold and one which i have in my pocket   110.62654065004902
he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to planchet   36.825093150270106
in the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance an enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves   131.39901452959614
the past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others   109.96219612401623
in fact the blow was direct and severe   49.68654709518023
it is well said dantès   82.33696729937625
instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood   62.14299259996177
he labored and toiled until he had amassed 250 000 francs   47.299691390595555
and the abbé s plan has not even the merit of originality   67.92494066035681
it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications   92.40552193705393
the count de rochefort   25.42264653646555
with the duke s aid they already considered themselves invincible   31.516418599274758
i did hope man is a poor wretched creature i did hope   170.42110812161792
it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours   185.7116944990073
i understand he said you confess   91.95769613934542
but we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it   88.2947328172495
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madame thanks for your punctuality   6.7143021542617305
do you not remember that while you were seated on a stone bench and while as i told you mademoiselle de villefort and your young son were absent you conversed for a considerable time with somebody   136.08430333045166
i do not like to be kept waiting   32.60896754396714
then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one   152.31868575893256
demanded porthos   154.7284683083543
because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return   90.41237318920722
who s up there   101.39783295610431
who is it   135.36295410258924
how much did the jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it   2.3599624145202824
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself   136.65644398426414
hark   101.15780471729539
a tear which appeared in the old man s eye expressed his thanks to the doctor   155.4900091477969
yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak   51.4738073219099
grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his eyes   39.723357818971635
yes certainly   175.19505757119728
that is all very simple you had business in england   65.50446464560802
shall i accompany you monsieur   113.11168860974057
thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped   119.97641318423466
let us first send for two soldiers said the governor   67.88665147008038
armentières on the banks of the lys   70.84711449262875
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door   101.0150881437073
why do you doubt   127.38660740921469
28   93.4400549309311
now said gondy there is a communion between us   107.365649604337
i am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it   160.97022961958206
i neither ill use nor ill treat my servants by word or action   84.4668876416406
suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress ah said he good good   185.81465498377517
well   85.73666750799043
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent   171.78625454565335
de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham   127.48458539820703
and for pirates returned gaetano repeating franz s words   106.57515531711421
here begins the trial   116.87406451260107
fifty thousand francs a year said porthos   173.01843752467707
i do not understand said danglars   191.44473335714164
do what i tell you and immortality awaits you   5.655919699727832
for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to one s destination   113.21258201649924
if they had discovered milady s retreat three were to remain on guard   131.65867923806815
this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night   117.3404841486261
i see you have not forgotten the name   204.90503545110548
oh may god keep me from it and you too   15.759560118788002
it will be well to prepare a light supper of which you athos and aramis are not to partake athos because i told him you had a fever   230.69095620774735
that might give him a poor idea of you   93.49889158891354
suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion   237.26998878876697
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets   217.80268719473952
if you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains out   96.24893202396503
said carmela   138.6257352889727
you blackguard   83.68765839142165
ah but what is the matter with your hand d artagnan   117.18453323275654
the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence   120.36197365530786
besides the words of villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom   158.44755125294432
have you any other guests in your house   53.60058589775674
yes for i often wish for what is impossible   51.25128838238341
do you observe said the countess g to albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people   107.00198140864008
de tréville it had disappeared   47.901198024802085
there is still time to withdraw   131.06801271595032
see he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught   50.05152688953385
pardieu   231.76784934173423
d artagnan followed them   174.04031236053936
caderousse quickly performed the stranger s bidding   147.1138858723213
help   182.12598674211648
not a word   143.4517316937241
go go i implore you and return hereafter   138.8989670354715
and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read   62.74522858489007
then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow   224.1024456980478
cried the marquise   114.13834937068522
come guitant come along and let s see if they keep watch at the quinze vingts as at the barriere des sergens   78.0001146797484
i am not mistaken   33.270572928213355
i can scarcely credit it   78.38372739432359
excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary   174.33768597732688
athos you are not in your right senses i swear   162.62547560940016
alas   93.94824122547092
what happened then   205.73976362594175
no i never saw him until a few days since and am not responsible for him   188.84868540150032
and he will be guillotined will he not   118.99326239999226
when i awoke a fresh meal was served   136.12885135087345
they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier   97.06580065848297
no replied d artagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes i can see what other people can not see   136.46901294834242
that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults   111.95443733306548
and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs savoring of the man of quality a league off   89.59525677737437
have you anything particular against him   299.1176311579658
monsieur d artagnan   214.03403102168093
drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the apartment   94.3777808893523
enough   24.42334374420213
at length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountainside   134.6294500628785
i shall replied d artagnan and instantly   105.32628652003348
signor pastrini had promised them a banquet   142.769757783013
and so on progressively   164.7744777021441
can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties   150.59485074936086
comminges returned to his post   134.85604819721507
tell me continued winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in france that henry iv   132.83728371104837
i don t know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you are speaking my lord   186.0971432330041
let us go and embrace raoul   200.79934108455333
then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand come i had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson i only wanted a murder and here it is   77.38479536146359
only i took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for i had no doubt i was watched   118.71853009320456
said he   110.62854329254435
i shall abide by that rule   108.61972092591903
oho   51.582656056624856
you ll be shut up again in the bastile   158.76822308712661
no   209.58574484028168
i shall obey the wishes of the people   201.98437982672706
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags   75.63242930589547
raoul entered at this moment   58.41789340674514
thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle eugénie perceives i am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions   160.3680345749825
is treated at the court of france   144.1502535120612
gutenberg   152.77610550676584
let us start then   53.920089872900164
i have at length then intelligence of you   33.10396491850007
has he any friends   23.52967372227019
such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes that of the abbé dubuquoi from for l evêque   180.26184577985657
i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities   95.38699490311005
but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then   50.09505517678882
the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of the little versailles   110.75167325589754
bravo d artagnan   272.4157048636424
with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost   64.87057035851481
his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue   152.10995060947116
i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen   13.675639843291023
oh no   110.22884998939985
are you then pressed for this money   59.85844441342555
although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him   139.99704424449058
madame danglars trembled with fear   107.59585254952947
no   195.8730799019002
faith no   152.58769166690672
d artagnan desired planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared   103.88763297349745
the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat   173.5801418608509
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived   3.084246217962331
meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself   112.41809673659905
louis that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably ancient   62.026697062667914
depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you   160.60191256761212
he turned a deaf ear and contented himself with laughing and between two parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword here cried he parodying a verse of the bible here will bicarat die   105.66556842471715
the queen and the duke   121.62284857011475
rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of living that will signify but little that concerns god you and myself   92.37269769730788
yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting   137.13165679964615
there is something horribly mysterious under all this athos   172.98021496378078
pardieu   59.52881708960339
i have told my secret   175.4028051392733
i dragged myself as far as the yard   160.86182275358786
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared   188.8476950259765
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy   12.637901116150317
d artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off   117.60506094390095
he turned and saw julie   127.70549054167502
forever   14.087102482427198
what can cardinal mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as richelieu to act as we pleased   22.80042034767851
then in a suppressed tone as if speaking to himself this is annoying continued he   61.39782675418443
i wrote verses in the style of benserade you my lord   95.84641469453945
d artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m   85.08386984945838
then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in lyons   88.17194966840266
denis   79.57189894760282
cried porthos coming forward   213.55032362367103
from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anything   217.8570414727589
have you seen anything   84.307815338204
where   201.80077515877878
you are about my height pierre said he   106.28384736686603
i count upon it   123.44126896532418
meanwhile let me take these men away   151.11949912632846
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory   58.776653380068865
not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea   183.94480260416668
besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before   58.96429420237917
i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence   126.40658730901318
having said that they went out of the stable   98.93268874355067
and you porthos   176.88637337335595
chapter 71   157.6509623766467
chapter 29   246.57295735476487
i think so indeed cried he   69.85048518323697
i do not jest said athos   2.5384831104300076
said the englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance   84.54576890556555
alas they have taken everything   95.60293110325378
this way   100.03635374644477
his face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle   37.51875763215041
enough   163.1930964948886
yes i am going   127.64338851374457
let us draw lots   150.22421192979746
your affair is not bad said athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good   106.3990038854518
whose then is the air we breathe   66.78528716094718
have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met   168.78653674374704
the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child   199.85786417000566
everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror   127.77079747405709
as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m   114.52305723686483
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present   134.678362662425
besides are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud mousqueton and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos porthos and aramis   139.31420883085494
asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor   192.4434400982484
no   15.872366798274129
from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts   142.25110598527334
he is he would have added edmond dantès but the count seized his arm and prevented him   65.19598351161201
by whom then were we beaten   100.95687761548577
but i will tell you a true story my lord   134.8228783892781
he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future   155.96731960855575
if dead to deny him the rites of christian burial   5.958966060204034
hope   130.4974510496879
relate your story and i will applaud it if it is a good one   81.17146243387481
this league was directed against france   172.60507593996536
beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the french government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in italy since his paper is prohibited there   82.25106671963707
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it   136.06829701140856
planchet called his master s attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty paces   12.535481962808575
he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled   21.715514688131094
that you inherit from your mother   19.30547642745428
with opium belladonna brucea snake wood and the cherry laurel they put to sleep all who stand in their way   113.7008275464166
the matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated   78.14082315233114
are you not going to put up at the arms of england   87.82046266543034
hush   94.54965464185027
but i can not said she   54.37220490820553
think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of us   172.73670184697687
mazarin looked at her and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts he read her thoughts in her countenance as one sees in a transparent lake clouds pass reflections like thoughts of the heavens   27.802123667838487
a bell resounded   143.32698524166312
at nine o clock tomorrow rita s father will be here with the money   81.9141493924923
with certain people everything comes round   158.16733996652806
bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet who then went satisfied to his shed   59.26415922048796
what more will you say   36.357781419086535
swords then   80.03082605535835
yes you are right replied villefort surprised   24.62185040675196
and you have me my lord   103.58436532853693
meanwhile valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed edward s room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little staircase   178.18687669184845
and he sent them to you   77.1227767481371
cried monte cristo   152.28454627333298
the more this young man was superior to others the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him   205.06028467860224
yes replied the procureur   136.98682048296422
i am a brute   78.01669635862532
about that   113.59731606261316
de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france   128.5931521637308
his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french   155.96933731706267
go away as quick as you can maximilian said valentine and stay till i send for you   101.02614889083421
the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room   123.08804123290543
we set out last evening and here we are   121.6875382679458
do you talk in your sleep   86.02220776485237
ah   164.0895179342687
i have a post by which i live   115.10745584626281
we need only a week to amend all that   101.3175994627234
said the general shrugging his shoulders   51.737050998136795
perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of fate   168.68539280113342
if that is really so how came you in the bastille   105.66466949557618
be satisfied said the procurator s wife   80.62451126974489
the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for d artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant   12.456909174182428
aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing   89.08270421475562
one step nearer said comminges putting down the sashes that the interior of the carriage might be well seen and placing his sword on his prisoner s breast one step nearer and i kill the prisoner   106.53101767097822
ah   27.855577320499776
ah   98.86782292924289
monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said   96.99361474893121
i know not whom   175.220336335014
eh   132.00926547907423
i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant   124.83792712962435
that is to say he was there replied planchet   167.93056789587706
and he comes from marseilles   156.7956861234655
women weep for the dead   141.91579850350416
we took good care not to do that   38.6997791568009
d artagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding   93.79041898427123
you prefer then said the abbé that i should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship   150.39016578744975
another shot of a carbine was heard   176.53858871476996
she has fainted   30.328671935534288
it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life   209.40782999671535
yes her majesty the queen rochefort smiled contemptuously   133.2253555962302
we have the first throw   49.22584722031063
we leave you in an excellent tone of mind   223.74947554894834
pray was not monsieur d artagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly   102.11904956060953
it is of this homicidal thought that i now bear the punishment   113.37423731212296
then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which frenchman would combat against frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy   183.51123272870134
go and see mercédès and afterwards come to me   14.978522305332504
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris   225.39525567536532
i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said he   56.939722784432924
his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his shoulders   76.6419555647878
monsieur bazin said friquet monsieur maillard you know who he is he gives holy water at saint eustache well go on   112.99127106125404
the king s room   105.3736640264438
but that athos on the contrary would despise him   138.0520387230442
the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest   274.8529289314091
father you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques   135.8616596383804
but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon   128.7342025467534
i am here because i am a soldier and have to obey orders i have taken an oath to obey and i do obey   20.30242693082363
cromwell had two or three of these retreats in london unknown except to the most intimate of his friends   152.77965363343966
since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further   209.31071611228685
for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings   89.9996438886646
that monsieur de beaufort had escaped were you not   121.22648417645902
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthos s long cloak and d artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it   112.98114676402999
said the king   75.52508966631092
i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris   187.0206390227071
why the good god sends him back again   92.13202284345066
and why   99.56029097556194
extraordinary did you say   155.23734675241624
you noticed that i didn t breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit   76.90511315371869
in the next place you are in trouble of which i am very glad as it gives me an opportunity of placing myself at your service and god knows i am ready to throw myself into the fire for you   209.38810782425963
with two companions yes replied the duke   104.71882230207295
then here s to our next merry meeting   112.89088646250977
they entered the common hall and placed themselves at table   154.2390880208427
the cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of m   88.17964638529395
that s no affair of mine replied the englishman that is the affair of the house of thomson french in whose name i act   75.8955991738816
in fact looking at the place to which athos pointed d artagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gallop   154.0108080470407
a table which had been covered with an elegant supper was overturned   239.68751856987026
a man who nearly killed mazarin between two doors   74.0000033438911
i assure you madame replied the woman it is as i have said   93.42579806640592
it is not to be called amiability it is her duty   133.58786403499775
villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner   70.18005504697831
i command you to speak   95.66542784376507
but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business   169.3597842711702
on him on him always on him   162.51927530493646
what has happened to you my lord   108.92669887523253
milady s son   188.51733917690646
from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door   97.37176633793086

but if he annoys you this young fool to be sure he does   176.56211515330767
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him   74.56745918317696
indeed   64.8017986983595

an unhappy prisoner replied dantès who made no hesitation in answering   80.2841333591144

cried d artagnan   148.72120755601105
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom   116.26255321639668
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him   105.53006706718978
asked athos   57.18357620289383

then said she he has well played his part   134.42023632437804
she was no longer there but she had left her new address   202.08868297397026
but where are you going monsieur where are you going   203.858941744543

thought d artagnan   119.0445798332014
de villefort   82.13582951913409
all this is vague enough   176.12059456449612

my dear friend you guess well   68.21436779969075
that is easily understood   6.3158280089636065
ah i understand said the lieutenant   156.0340871575516
we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray   143.32988475954534
i am   86.69648724695621

while d artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors aramis had joined his companions   153.10752772276794
the monk recovered his usual expression   92.50107652499729
how i have called him in my long sleepless nights   113.85817361479383

but what i know is that i promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going   130.95290204554
milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation   80.847214420134
of what   156.13347440819481
one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin   164.29029412151857
the whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world   110.6013696275329
i recollect now   194.73259770219948

an hour after sunset   117.59538892714683
you are eating horse   119.2311870231566
then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies   39.83755222417176
here s one your honor how the devil hast thou two horses   37.45771120214525
d avrigny took the young man s arm and led him out of the room   101.30693279042528
no   131.83817279478657
asked d artagnan   145.89611272896536
and d artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking   55.47509155448715
let us see the watch said albert   82.28104042453366
turning to his friend dear maximilian said the count have you nothing to do in this land   108.69302741801549
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders   91.10921424997866
if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end   36.01060585788409
what is it then   170.43752381376532

but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom   75.23601117408236
that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself   203.20341147894754
danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke   79.38506806814692
it is not ill planned said the governor   137.90522687012577
but all these reasons were combated destroyed overthrown by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over us   193.26088259530223
and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper   59.037100892161796
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom   85.2931399733142
we have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your prisoners   205.61449774504752

cried mercédès   90.68107747782486
my faith it was time that idea came into porthos s head   108.25708768589544
how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight   51.922651977310764

inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saint méran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two   103.91521269351479
he consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded man   92.04756150639321
look my lord cardinal said aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love   36.52373159800392
i know that is the report   116.22661786872341
well said monte cristo it is just as i thought   109.45710765545155

i have its fellow he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and it cost me 3 000 francs   58.628112617374235

who retreated a step and frowned   148.5880839498813
crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal   179.45020865155442

he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love   71.82293877769607
said the cardinal i know of whom you speak   29.39261403805503
you see then said athos there is a god in heaven still   153.21296235884577

but how   82.05689306428071
cried d artagnan recognizing the handwriting   42.32062060529631

the first idea that occurred to milady s mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant   52.04441447050971

at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so   98.5766956797179
but how am i to act   131.25653559803365
still he had not even uttered a sigh   65.14988563522506
no no dear friend   170.13526254403996
but devil take him   8.249762983459235

then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords   170.88054597537482

he ascended into grottos paved with emeralds with panels of rubies and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites   252.50541791552152
so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind   77.60812996568052
ah may you be a true prophet   184.84637787415284
oh it s nothing said d artagnan   52.891382168376374
it may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminence s guardsmen had received   6.667993331502387
he opened it and read as follows dear m   26.50358241877572
france needs you   111.7843735642417
not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden   210.95674448921457
repeated m   84.4759251536951
morrel s clear eye was for the moment clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large tear rolled down his cheek   200.92941060259386
cried d artagnan   148.84335128001348
as to the left hand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the minister of the interior   85.45129772205716
let us change the subject   193.94141736786602
the two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of comminges   101.97229465359703
and i too exclaimed porthos   166.93698072714022
yes sir   84.0486116856545
in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes gigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from men s shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs   112.13758554871293
i think the arm will make up for the sword   127.69542771388078
his desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever   22.943007197323965
the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole   96.42001955812121
in the name of that god i act remember that wretch and to spare thee at this moment is still serving him   112.6104510944094
noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage i forbid you to understand him   72.05332315595379
said d artagnan   155.65948538440097
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote to mlle   137.2058082518158
the king s   158.27235239940367
and now prisoner will you consent to tell your name   156.176828205197
well ali my nubian believes me to be an arab   150.79467015529565
aramis cast a glance upon d artagnan to see what effect all this produced and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws   23.140382908608416
i attach myself to it   58.75165529673138
milady de boulogne evening of the twenty fifth   182.5481565036202
hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth powder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading papers of paris muttering these papers become more and more stupid every day   70.11588349761408
at length parliament was convoked   141.91414034648338
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir   193.8012376502586
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him   88.87107998214663
now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch   82.31742712002622
3 and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready   92.96359098189077
full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked good extended his affection even to his judge spite of villefort s severe look and stern accent   191.4081859721732
adieu count till to morrow   105.12126384012058
he had taken the lady as far as fromelles   169.9077435388071
the morning air has made me hungry   141.47567810223035
what more is to be done   87.29831033577479
the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of josephine   62.29774271337732
turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips   11.264002619357058
they spurred on their horses   13.790992430831906
my dear doctor there is no communication between m   137.56813776328903
is it possible whispered franz that you entertain any fear   102.28944566516611
well my lord said la ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them   49.46362903928828
yes said the queen it is requested   142.82259390360463
the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice   127.61812930180687
what would you have planchet   118.70385888656725
it is really wonderful said the count   115.07396518979118
to grief succeeded rage   106.65351868701094
no sir do not call him i conjure you   143.7211210859142
i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds   184.90587751183443
these were the ancestors of charles standing back dimly in their tarnished frames   207.33992211157323
he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune   184.8670556930107
the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman has his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor a brigand a rascal has with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence chalais s throat cut under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry monsieur to the queen   161.19191580602876
what were you saying to this youngster   188.80507241751593
and where are they looking for her   48.935501105843684
examine the past and the present and endeavor to dive into futurity and then say whether i am not a divine instrument   110.48026244097377
and i came sir added raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for i thought you would be glad to see me again   47.60080361545185
we must not do so   195.26240536348791
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person   179.87540242930893
at that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone athos made a bound of surprise   106.26959397925597
one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were sitting   145.45673725125747
and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv   130.8783832911476
a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept   139.51382458056457
the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment   102.70571938291876
adieu gentlemen said de comminges   216.47413688408562
he took his fowling piece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure   3.692236880026968
mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses   94.56599991230007
said buckingham looking at felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them   112.09895804852361
the lackeys were brought by the cries she made   209.0158680678348
he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at d artagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance   110.58760724628499
must i say baron danglars   19.218655820673348
pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury   120.940765963516
morrel farewell   105.05953149679587
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe   157.51462768990265
then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain monte cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions   42.75874055887634
no   142.77185404986014
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell   51.67633369203939
bind my arms my lord fast   112.16074584037719
the commission is usually one and a half   159.7750542968032
amuse yourself with milady my dear d artagnan   65.55903604238097
the devil thou dost not   211.66988722065963
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech   29.998120169809937
and supposing you had succeeded   85.60989758504013
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw lots   28.970496615424892
coquenard whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table   100.47380489790807
well let us sleep at noyon said raoul   67.51413540644094
who   94.68263153384652
exclaimed dantès   91.57084318532247
you have said nothing have you   26.110199186991125
i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musketoon   124.16571724191101
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands   73.16286883586469
my fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country valentine as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city   142.06180583040577
and your swords they saw the light of day i presume   81.38284797974083
franz d épinay said he   147.78394154937683
you will see said the man proudly   89.74015710952571
in the country people alter   59.03779619240645
oh   82.59833659857043
what is it   149.66664279750535
but the accomplice shall become the avenger   145.33795727884805
ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise   138.2054623958029
this fawn colored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of la lionne   170.77786696840786
fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised   22.410291200758337
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands   146.66377979318094
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion   173.6885377171033
he is all powerful even with the king   165.36451639380232
but we do not invite people of fashion   134.27057078427563
but that is doing things in lordly style my friend   158.49695601585358
ah   141.5657767560665
cried d artagnan   174.26560838722762
d artagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority   128.22364636730353
and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done   75.14442387950957
asked raoul naively i thought it was derogatory   174.1080815927331
it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale   206.59677416787474
but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness   119.58343056675407
what does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind at once implacable and generous   186.23606226629593
it is the usual block answered the man in the mask   30.261151253779886
he himself   183.15646652804907
a woman will sell you for ten pistoles witness delilah   110.51136263488681
athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword   164.14692585772656
the two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything   108.53581192410223
say on   47.54874822338479
tell them to order number 25 to come downstairs   95.38903579580946
ali brought in the coffee   0.1384034412487125
but why into five parts   226.1719166012186
you killed my father   34.526201069008906
asked the duke   70.85807555812755
and looked so strangely at me   126.16474290234675
i will not acknowledge a crime in my house   104.30705854916931
no listen to me   74.61890885304891
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance   65.84751741711764
cried milady   160.4843542009271
said d artagnan laughing   255.82485530011783
but if i were ever to meet him i should recognize him in an instant i will answer for it were he among a thousand persons   174.01326219222852
if i like   76.33676556176573
well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand pistoles   100.68580897147476
no   27.414161263486406
have you made inquiry   130.95225221949156
ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert   139.19917520678587
inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title   198.26627918124524
do you think then that any harm can have happened to him   24.507181610113633
and you monsieur du vallon is that your advice   87.36023684275213
a cold perspiration burst out on villefort s brow   199.09774090756088
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief   65.3179362871658
did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximilian too rich   88.43484265297258
in the first place said milady it is possible i may be deceived and that d artagnan and his friends may really come to your assistance   45.50071039540633
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them   140.20255394701482
i am watching said porthos   65.8745284912694
chapter xxxiii   115.81715552052553
his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution   59.95128197780145
nothing the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions   67.63464823999976
dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands and said has your majesty perused yesterday s report   50.79983327090011
yes but they are never used   54.89275963138801
let us be off   12.2047545601215
said a loud voice   107.65370844369676
it is indeed the same said he   135.03329485120713
replied d artagnan with feverish volubility   216.24290376322566
indeed   211.75495195691605
and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing you may regard it as done for done it shall be on the word and faith of hush   173.46474250948015
said d artagnan   105.33393498317604
said mazarin and when has rueil been a prison   24.32271784502676
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the wax light always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment   83.7327354331631
this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage   150.21994549516836
athos was not altogether the queen s dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again   169.66291045113127
bonacieux accosted him   86.68566840851815
morrel was deeply in love and barrois was dying with heat and exertion   104.27673022325028
mme   87.24234148201748
but i am not selfish and i thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter   162.40183505822304
now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be here   118.30851913345565
coquenard and bade him farewell   155.52711404842415
you see my position madame said morrel bestowing a grateful smile on monte cristo   93.469647192667
my dear friend here athos spoke rest assured if we were mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport   94.14606940779974
i shall have to watch the men who pick up balls   67.21227486781646
and this very morning the surgeon declared that if monsieur porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was i who had sent for him   67.62791683888184
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted   127.98579662910055
in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal s guards who recognized d artagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning   218.2456954947934
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage   78.97156278923259
most certainly but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant this dear child and myself must both have perished   134.78177993247164
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria   91.68367301208865
but how handsome thou art how fat   127.62020536647648
there now again you degrade me   2.3667019930587117
as he was passing the allée des veuves he thought he saw the count s horses standing at gosset s shooting gallery   200.3235079573241
at dessert d artagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease   135.2072483439678
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment   172.2829008444317
blaisois went with him   127.96271684142012
peppino glanced anxiously at franz   115.653271771804
the country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald   85.05966926020162
did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty   116.33139264393334
almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair   131.99638706778327
and then we have our hours of recreation and our holidays   156.24264466962654
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends   36.04900392609771
you are indeed a nobleman   196.64508731978754
he commanded with it   168.3850961341973
asked felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal   16.400423930260004
but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman go on home   120.37627350195544
porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea   80.58947006299815
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it   170.31061739968086
he approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive away   28.234851681440574
besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces   155.3556799019963
monsieur du vallon and myself came from france with him   2.574045908127786
coquenard was in the dilemma of harpagan   147.37404464817112
madame morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing   16.44412110541637
why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner   112.40766227535073
but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash   63.76242757169895
love   99.60824980231213
he were a dead man said the gascon if there were still a vitry at the court and if vitry entered at this moment   223.8135422034091
a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith   118.06511072856648
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them   79.1119157458011
villefort walked to and fro behind them   98.33198872769063
i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time   166.0969110496173
no madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a christian   169.20840544546635
you must love somebody   153.56774027515752
besides you owe me some thanks   75.7382007305234
but where are you going to eat my breakfast   178.77627513047287
at this moment m   137.80200703007662
if i bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of england   122.66843217676208
replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet   176.11527958907624
bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening   180.18107914792557
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story   75.0286796721056
to paris   175.12488745119444
it was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion   72.30858790109863
danglars thought dentro la testa meant put in your head   195.07509163031594
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us   85.42359881406077
to horse then gentlemen   183.26692614763715
attempt to murder me in my father s house in my room on my bed of sickness   22.964712220020175
beauty has always been and always will be all powerful   170.2751634001195
said d artagnan mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso   20.70945261053498
they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay   84.2185179935027
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hope her only means of safety   161.89776806565112
madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their example   223.83823799848972
not so mademoiselle eugénie danglars   4.882400510010669
this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that i wish to belong to the church and that i avoid all mundane opportunities   130.3122764811883
said andrea   171.96614755815006
bonacieux and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other s throat   211.91218145048177
come in come in said morrel for i presume you are all at the door   190.5673394023015
so then so then pack up our luggage planchet and let us be off   180.22692820489448
never mind continued the man in the cloak   83.02229629115047
they shall not have the king   196.9361009970942
this was a great affront to the king s army and a great inconvenience to the cardinal who had no longer it is true to embroil louis xiii   158.68762139712143
has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes   23.67094578120475
chapter xxxvii   147.92985365121075
the same order was followed in returning nor did grimaud s searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the rue guenegaud and of the quai   160.29998282402605
the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf s narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion   54.956924762082465
said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would   124.25189139467733
yes   116.04745883063975
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio   181.05177923285714
the youth s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face   90.58174277668893
for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing   97.0137431240708
40176m albert opened the paper it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of yanina proving that colonel fernand mondego in the service of ali tepelini had surrendered the castle for two million crowns   119.80778132716496
that she disliked the idea of being married   162.7739352335119
you may torture torment kill me but you shall not have my signature again   84.69279291010655
while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars   11.847896056517357
and this time i come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other to say to you as god said to the first murderer cain what hast thou done to thy brother abel   114.36138850458936
no indeed   75.14944811715566
ah my dear aramis this time i shall find you out   95.71440407396358
has the queen any further commands for me now   176.24189738846587
no   97.07591951510432
athos was right   106.93934874921352
and now sir resumed mousqueton when he had rid himself of planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend s fat back now sir allow me to leave you for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself   188.92258348073403
very well   103.15793601633972
bravo said maximilian   197.87813456238788
i doubt it planchet replied d artagnan but what are you thinking of   104.40961001119099
have i anything to pay   129.69312160266264
holà mousqueton seats and order double the bottles   157.93509093428804
my dear friends said d artagnan give your swords to monsieur mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners   194.09697347919652
replied d artagnan for my part i am eating veal garnished with shrimps and vegetables   154.65765447035534
if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them   81.40366660915353
the carriage stopped at the door of the palace   156.34821075381683
i   109.2023768811828
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities   224.23712663112542
he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty   148.42944545020418
well then what do you say to la specchia   140.8999613977959
replied the doctor   219.50746660472478
his lieutenant   93.78273317498339
well come   126.41895876141614
go to bed planchet and sleep soundly   8.613340145189127
but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto   215.57013288042856
i was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o clock when i caught sight of your carriage and horses   115.15846461736047
i merely suspend my decision that is all   23.477525268842655
but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning   63.77400266902758
i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you   14.259939843874605
all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling   39.701226664987075
you comprehend   178.51435352634024
generously   208.7387915394395
oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that i have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended   167.64228937224593
as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud   63.47262828802725
but happily the abbé busoni thought for you   106.83410753702643
4 and he your excellency is poor peppino   122.11167137279396
ah monsieur hypocrite i understand how you study theology   109.99058049846197
these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect   233.658299153333
it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest whispers of ambition counsels of selfishness   147.8109194196723
and so soon too   233.48448733621643
i see you are covered with blood   171.70848596913805
her friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution   102.85306751413698
thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the lord   115.84788484705483
then continued athos we have another reason   116.92640436877828
while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose   64.29645474890687
well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right   68.01787111922046
asked milady   89.96440096860795
d artagnan will give each of us his instructions   131.68028539121343
whatever i may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to follow   75.33503657624595
i will go   75.30400592087298
now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter   96.08468261125
but we have not as yet declared war   22.390571709033367
i will do more than i promise said dantès   114.64386501794806
yes replied the young man i ask you in what year   175.1203743908805
if i had known that i was to have the honor of your visit i should have procured the gardener s ladder   151.03232344466014
albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand   137.89057558728405
milady arose   70.99776495789061
you can t think how i have missed him the great simpleton   5.25089863635921
ah   99.29486285277608
d artagnan answered with the greatest simplicity i came to paris with exactly such intentions   96.54820407839699
and did you not remonstrate against such infamy   136.44980805024113
but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone   122.77284461355504
madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face   264.4539507926743
there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration   123.71410683227337
you suppose then that there are some   201.93212299417576
let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours   165.97451526535068
noirtier wants said the notary   121.23650569467381
yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock   141.09326482083816
impossible madame impossible   12.749388512806235
on the contrary the lackeys knew milady perfectly   88.55267030104208
yes replied the brigadier   112.17292454563406
but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes   91.26872039993538
make your mind easy   41.83474897542
she will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the bourse   81.35387478195436
because you would bring us to ruin   56.65184094049047
silence and fatigue together overcame d artagnan and sleep overtook him also   15.125783327546841
still marquise it has been so with other usurpers cromwell for instance who was not half so bad as napoleon had his partisans and advocates   181.79744212549934
this is quite another man and does not resemble him at all   109.81966991928064
what brother   172.67206881887398
that i think is as much as i shall want   85.34471406700352
you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world can not equal in horror   66.72994018791127
you know gentlemen that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant   94.95480157401306
grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened   173.20098359601175
and on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me   176.70231640181657
then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty   20.256246751704097
that is the title the french give to the post which you filled in italy   136.9522288130727
morrel relaxed his hold of valentine and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain   159.44139928308658
the accused replied that his name was jacques michel bonacieux that he was fifty one years old a retired mercer and lived rue des fossoyeurs no   57.240770026740876
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnestly   66.49026694950093
the commission might well be called delicate   122.68486839442774
he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette   93.63906717772811
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy   120.29588946323199
in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not   167.18109623832726
do you return to paris   51.642428506672715
not more than eight or ten feet   136.38276969309132
ah   132.72504410271983
asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion   190.0202105856422
cried the three musketeers all together on seeing d artagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger   185.9668448951092
can you see what they are doing   116.56215913724503
not at all my good friend   46.37599312596531
father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat   157.19282583817568
and you would have done the same aramis   44.68265934761149
have i not then that right   33.76099084722523
and he threw the money into the river   83.87419245703433
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence   151.70556204771165
morrel i hear you insinuating dog you   168.9793263572919
there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill   64.47566230156696
i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it   115.22398641883402
in madame de villefort s room   184.02329808202592
but first of all how are madeleine and antoinette   74.81918946125023
has she then been appointed provost of merchants   150.5232970977927
do you understand me   226.18617365674834
ah then madame i was able for one instant to be alone with you   116.214703040204
if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything   93.34140394968908
but at the same time my boy i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it   129.55390496004048
asked la ramee   104.89444041633442
ah thanks felton thanks   114.77687866843672
to be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power   108.62453215533452
murmured the duke looking at the king and dandré who spoke alternately like virgil s shepherds   207.4514903937939
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the manager of the project gutenberg™ trademark   284.0723036166996
but you remind me   139.45131531764827
alas   60.68291751236345
the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest   109.67972826053995
thought d artagnan   118.53237160223725
alone in the world i had but my son and he has left me   87.73952359694059
these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity   159.90880240570903
my only fear is the chance of dantès being released   106.3015161290705
to morrow we shall know if you are good in action   18.97174677320845
oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money   84.10412273973253
but athos being warned of his coming went into the other chamber   123.073550389244
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women   167.62222878842937
take it i pray   64.53584385566523
not at all said athos calmly   131.24633089442779
albert recognized the bearer   90.42092334949334
come come gentlemen remove the fellow   122.20641446384941
he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd   129.02514059754424
and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest   98.92015560118816
nearly nine years   72.90121555446079
porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible   103.05417025973394
but better so than die of shame   211.6181693537271
you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you raoul   147.67022680004428
but don t sleep as you do all the time   140.26661555963
cried d artagnan   86.24434316700453
the hôtel then is far away   235.84116598840345
must see him   55.39970004519363
i can assure her majesty that if she does not sign to day she will not have time to sign to morrow   81.73252778209269
ha ha said château renaud here come some friends of yours viscount   37.863355239506035
he approached the doctor and seizing his arm valentine said he it is valentine s turn   258.71242543922534
you bid me adieu   130.7748398738301
i will tell you all about it replied mousqueton   223.82472506902144
devil s coachman   108.24035227141621
listen said the young man to the sentinel   52.736724027061
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the people s good will   82.63535810712827
and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time   159.8947907829213
40070m from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass   128.65551226777424
athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to withdraw   133.61961902858656
i shall be sure to find employment   39.09758256932359
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt   135.29700631635112
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales   73.48624051444784
but what name can you give it what name will the lord give it if i am innocent   85.79343423592442
was born   132.2087915223192
pity me   210.72711691515002
asked d artagnan   211.82686880127758
do you intend opening the door   29.530179850893163
next moment d artagnan entered   45.80272295700392
one drop will restore life as you have seen   130.3090057906263
your servants will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape   14.982674601884042
neither of them had returned   60.9095497254421
then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too   26.97081559247779
a second time he was disappointed in his expectation   158.44859875655837
to the smaller   77.45607797733638
after nine at night pardieu   179.74117139507104
so that we have twelve hours before us   87.98506012020108
besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us   213.48125820791535
you are right said d artagnan   67.66207953989024
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect   92.72360613532078
i have not seen such a one four times in my life   41.45661041991451
when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it you will further say to him watch over his grace lord buckingham for they wish to assassinate him   53.07575281453091
and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i have told you of my love and my hopes may i inform you of my intentions   155.62389375273995
she drew her husband to the door   183.83220189052668
you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a prelate   99.88982094356619
then your excellency is going to the hotel   98.70162194126078
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort s brow because they were guilty   118.3318395291629
cried he   182.77008112203652
why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study   140.19705858494694
first it flies then despairs and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers   177.88263212674545
la ramee was going out   110.21410189590986
i don t think the sides are equal   193.0535078416674
she saw albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused   175.54862223068673
d artagnan he said you are here to night still infuriated by yesterday s adventure   126.32739479968004
my dear planchet said d artagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me   138.01009008153213
château renaud returned debray you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint germain   146.41098864585527
do you know that i die to morrow at ten o clock   63.5004566697954
bazin became a lay brother   194.43479495051668
you can form no idea of the expression of that old man s eye when he looks at me the only person in the world whom he loves and i had almost said by whom he is beloved in return   109.91825224634809
the name is wanting in this commission   318.10900709965296
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme   62.27413830239845
and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded   156.02937919048213
very well sir replied broussel what is this order   135.52353061675302
the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta   191.1415148035166
as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom and fell back on his seat overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair   107.79257469770111
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms   127.73299260295873
ah   203.5230018649052
mademoiselle de scudery was going   69.47177704299716
and i mine said porthos   107.82427000133706
the gascon is the devil   106.49725113300146
i believe i see double   110.64458370563858
oh dear mother it was a dream   122.45900576629784
de morcerf went out about half an hour ago   150.84020704814733
stop said the duke pistache jump for the queen   102.74898484374161
if you have two coats you will give me one of them   62.95336997852661
but do not be alarmed on her account   80.14452476284663
de guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him   37.016834464190424
i have this one safe   3.475965476463088
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady   149.03572289269056
de tréville   162.96156773362992
albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the paper   22.66817850632981
for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe   183.86876120327366
not at all   149.57586036543933
chapter lxxii   191.9186235462405
begone and may god guide you   181.19411718215943
grimaud placed the pie before the duke who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust   119.54913275588417
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door madame he said i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay   116.06641971851622
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door   231.75810928658473
certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it   115.25446285293397
my good friend said franz turning to him while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve   147.91788364698863
but tell me what do you ask   203.51775050683364
to day this morning   186.75604458607643
and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of morrel were stifled in his throat   135.81270440730108
not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly   208.2798215990495
my friend said morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future   135.60214323756665
de villefort the king s attorney   102.25718825186745
asked the count surprised   170.03454981821858
but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood   129.6452277675218
with the count of morcerf answered monte cristo   107.78010836635279
and so dantès after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven   90.00277070720512
that man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night   25.172818967697893
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name than mine   43.3232458221093
is this possible count   129.03293061970876
your pardon   116.12412264397877
my dear d artagnan replied aramis you understand when i was a musketeer i mounted guard as seldom as i could   218.65340527266474
said villefort he is a noble fellow   98.90492545068406
you lie   87.0588502828322
devil take me if i ve ever been so happy as at this moment   41.69532161704771
we are rich   135.44241002991936
it was a choice between the king and the cardinal the choice made it must be persisted in   103.63045782465076
you won t forget the boy sir   138.29676668826417
four hundred   10.919059612320922
but you my friend are you not going to change your dress   150.33893184862472
and as the pharaon arrived today why you understand   8.411298969178631
yes for you who detest those unhappy princes beauchamp and are always delighted to find fault with them   132.96447951360147
besides the count will be in his own house and only see them when he thinks fit to do so   107.00582156318875
said mazarin   85.25901882506427
be brave faithful and loyal he said you are brave faithful and loyal   243.06306686797984
every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deed annihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again   178.72812711733428
said gondy   103.43717226024319
make no allusion to the past   139.33041206325856
well listen baptistin what did i tell you this morning when i called you into my laboratory   93.54937207040206
i am not at home to any one said the duchess de chevreuse to the footman   81.79600646575864
it was delightful weather   81.53063290268204
confide in me   254.2771397616849
and his name was fernand   150.66546854296277
la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window   105.60322105651775
ah   57.686736605355684
when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of louis xviii   109.45059608889747
but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me   57.74885124319218
why did he detain her   59.07746657434219
count will you allow me to send baptistin to inquire after someone you know   93.59914741347154
danglars meditated an escape   173.61766367464048
four days replied his friend are necessary to reach blois   193.2774302339783
what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion   21.08906583513783
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed d artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her   68.38891342024519
everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination   99.0095022666855
i do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures   133.378256688233
the jailer advanced   35.57405532837551
the one in the dark blue coat   156.51094447287105
and you say you will wait for me at armentières   13.526387780966985
ah see there now   138.47335777691058
good   76.46954786879854
grimaud smiled   179.3491578601246
more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever   74.10710983795977
yes but we have drowned monsieur mordaunt   57.228392533139456
germain   92.89229570024747
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot   47.905471705163094
we are going with a mission to her majesty the queen of england   168.04073563556975
but i could find nothing absolutely nothing   111.55591186323396
what do you mean   17.473331012103387
well said he what next   153.65733414162884
and then too old dantès incessantly said to her our edmond is dead   19.84675796220924
and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny   29.930140704117534
i must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands   146.88772062338342
like every weak mind was wanting in generosity   126.49222526901926
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged   46.30705050501794
that strength was my life   152.4454236743924
30279m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life   124.52307210798725
the former royal attorney at nîmes   161.15285982922123
ah   38.50630380219857
can you recollect all that   52.35590654043929
then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said i have an enemy   30.836645696758268
mazarin as a statesman will understand the politic necessity   188.6591274772752
the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame   102.898645740471
the scheme is well known said the inspector   70.39793648499867
but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek   82.36413779259728
he however darted not the less quickly toward milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron   155.3510179006755
ha   78.01298494413031
well what should i say to the king   154.55446272887792
truly   119.36130019197441
let us therefore strike at wickedness   186.40544573093274
prove it to me   135.26403587247992
instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your course you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend   150.19748773351984
said the voice   221.72727789169306
you must blindly take what i give you   95.93973023367462
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served   96.8289759119097
in one hour after the ordinance was published in london that no vessel bound for france should leave port not even the packet boat with letters   55.01428451627076
you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow creature or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked   163.01252481353967
from congo if you will   169.8871335307651
if she had been a great lady she would have fainted   251.58896408620456
and madame de saint méran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixir three drops were sufficient   122.49694928334699
some days before the return of the emperor fernand was drafted   165.9304461174023
this time d artagnan was only in part mistaken   179.1892508369451
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knew that they had been seized stripped and bound   75.98372109408453
my son   77.06244627675818
the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and d artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss   189.7983525868563
chapter iii   153.67367954318024
no   158.09596397896314
madame said la meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh   187.78023596226515
at blois d artagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal   275.8711200003179
well done planchet   206.30749815321747
we are carrying port wine to anvers   18.366312436263343
then read for yourself   20.963215860423418
gutenberg   72.93094668279713
has the executioner left london   44.70390753921349
are you a man   108.82800498064358
and we are not always twenty years old   21.485179321581285
and you would be quite wrong my dear de winter said buckingham holding out his hand to him   88.5276654019825
in what manner could these events concern you   41.80448887520271
no never   129.9700377208844
i do not hesitate you know said grimaud   88.19077922932152
scoundrel infamous scoundrel   155.99084435706155
i have then about fifty pistoles   170.20323010674898
it is humiliating   166.9837741500203
and m   168.9830802488023
noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the king s attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed   168.98740633885552
0283m to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure   89.03906145689976
ha ha ye romans   133.22582572693506
it is a forgery   285.1654050131252
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not   138.22788059989082
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you   104.24781558091014
i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal   124.61868241874387
that negotiator will be me   181.33677907990588
oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular   76.69208957795493
the warm pressure made d artagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked himself   190.70263247379546
no he is a countryman of yours if a corsican is a countryman of anyone s   127.2747097098235
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face   125.98381734805488
i know monsieur de tréville   129.78518564580503
then he took away his mother s portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty   75.92495477170922
truly she might have thought of you at home   104.07864347512202
what is he aiming at   94.16497885502284
i would give as much as a hundred pistoles   154.8557646543528
athos took her hand and kissed it   106.29133336027917
what do you know respecting it   145.78114777041085
on wheels dear friend   21.857012949001643
and asked the abbé is m   119.847153874391
because monsieur some mischief might happen to you   54.362146965565685
this gascon is a precious fellow   61.53541077935705
adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him   58.54373505022339
said the king   78.78213941996917
bread and salt madame de morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion   142.2364470249712
really honest men are not so scarce as i thought   27.30961400591366
arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the enemy   73.47899734511739
and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse s tail and thus they took me to nîmes   16.440644857977958
he left the saucepan   181.01382294646038
most probably morrel and château renaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces   157.38522464926672
yes   81.06566606890209
do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend   95.25945823789196
the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait   106.44327953425473
positively   143.80151721369626
when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair   177.61400366735703
this traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands   87.92264122608383
then i felt that i was lost   59.13895531647763
we have money   195.0409116356492
a point short you know the proverb   55.99163237510558
now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand   181.4735417643646
chapter xvii   123.24385358161734
they seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies   4.717732201079215
no one   270.9881005043085
see   111.5385017716835
yes replied maximilian an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french at rome   183.6817057067804
let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask   171.3609271277687
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerf s face   97.6410543457414
i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career   212.42486622799836
no i was deceived   217.26845302473632
this evening said the governor when the task was ended   77.63367953533123
emmanuel and that his business was with m   56.839499132325926
the snow was falling thick and icy   41.787392804604465
ah my dear doctor said the procureur heaven declares itself against my house   153.21568798063427
now you are exactly what i dreamt you were the man i always loved   143.40263925087302
no said mazarin   133.7322917239133
caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate   166.25248488665332
perhaps she has spoken to the pharaon and brings you some tidings of her   16.10734291306467
tell your mistress he at length answered that i wish to speak to her and i beg she will wait for me in her own room   100.48977007639579
you understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases   158.1418915854172
said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame   100.43766338225875
said the cardinal   42.23735711084821
so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth   101.79168172655429

a loud cry could be heard by her   91.18490205699491
said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day grisier comes to my house   72.47445757249434
said the count   164.84638446199915
my husband the king is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired   35.124290330143026
and yet as he journeyed along a profound sadness weighed upon his heart   233.00372470674017
grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say   115.02493308481176
morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on the garden soon found the spot where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him   178.62799891353853
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian   180.31172778105014

at the moment when the hand of the massive time piece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door   111.81394168748365
ah yes   107.28012946709453
the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest   226.48967618261952
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him   84.5422205091094
i wish to speak with him   189.14596017058477
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw la gironde   149.10932083658298

the pouches contained 25 000 000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30 000 pounds of gunpowder   89.41781534381474
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars   167.67019842783301
villefort retired to his study and d avrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the dead   197.52230044810617
inquired danglars visibly agitated   66.01603939067083
asked d artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth   210.3938689578507
said caderousse groaning with pain   146.58977104134468
heigh sir said d artagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouse evading women   93.95560212456375

it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franz s host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges   70.55044051176674

he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east   160.1606948492194
with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night   148.8303253770928
and how is he connected with the question you asked me   128.87554679490694
are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth   78.59283739037541
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside   109.64674446795411

oh yes tired enough he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day   122.39856350738282
and he made a gesture of polite dismissal   142.47980928728924
the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held   129.95787395756727
who is your second witness   157.5495486783398
but how can you continue to receive us   123.55598622290874
we will cross switzerland and go down into italy by the saint gothard   97.64653059541237
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum   60.95805741501285
20243m confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beauchamp   137.81111906832936
then after an instant of gloomy reflection come i will go to see the morrels said he   36.07366071398353
well said cucumetto have you executed your commission   123.05537309051005
and it was peppino you saved was it not   67.81674578524141
after the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing   3.56272207406451
three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate   171.2023276707647
why i says i still think you ve got too much on   174.12651648770526

i feel so much pity towards you maximilian that listen to me attentively if i do not cure you in a month to the day to the very hour mark my words morrel i will place loaded pistols before you and a cup of the deadliest italian poison a poison more sure and prompt than that which has killed valentine   83.88261233458056
pardon me at least such i have heard is your custom   98.25302339553981
yes but i   143.30609982213355
you will see what a fellow he is   96.17611114807468
d artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses   200.61186252454627
well said dantès mark this   233.17342976674217

grimaud entered   47.80992331499459
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the auberge of the golden lily   81.47331189823367
it is as yet unknown to all and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian   108.67302912698898
whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness   203.1556056286526
at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good   79.5039527034241
let us push on then to noyon   98.85313403010261
what is your name my friend   89.77496983035796
parry too started and stopped reading   233.99860539771078
the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst d artagnan was looking at bazin   251.35724288251654
said caderousse   145.8184948082545
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune   145.15424834969997
as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place   52.76468843635148
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m   101.65483488890663
you were not expected   100.06390320921534

you were sent by some other person   170.5229885801188
30111m do you think so   97.74893631535247
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but d artagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis   207.81997203852146
i congratulate you my dear m   113.9314877654207
on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing   104.47199805879508
of course of course said the prisoners   86.04118600734562
you got in very well   39.770631546602004
seek not to console me   209.88127489338552
but you are dripping my dear fellow   86.8963438843358
an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn   213.92242892504214
asked milady   106.50753165370269
but monsieur you know then i know that you have been abducted madame   133.64273455114068
but others wish that you should go there   69.68457335178431

how do you mean   97.32006953044241
you don t like playing then   142.67078306215436
we must not send for a notary but for a doctor   32.6136452532744
asked athos   51.256101821658575
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers the soldier s throat   111.9859941232626
have i not always fought for your glory and interests   129.36865262512714
the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table   118.01406868731317
at the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to obey   61.324376767797034
oh it is impossible you must have saved some surer more subtle and deadly poison than any other that you might escape the punishment that you deserve   144.01530200413018
you can t refuse help to a poor hunted devil   151.29599152642183
never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me   175.2023259454332
the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence   190.48815260630067
with patience one must succeed   69.26851439929898
he might fail but something must be left to chance   229.32126671929794
said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death   134.3146060674566
royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns   104.27101367121155
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much ill will to follow to the end his role as confessor   66.2000216400811
before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm   168.71611271885854
to auteuil   132.12989351991467
ali pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to france when he was gazetted lieutenant general   183.12321667447821
at last as albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and monte cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the pit   42.435459783787664
athos said the king mechanically   23.117772195207095
s   3.9164733966521936
good lord how cold i am   148.0746118158464
the stables   162.00266026188987
it was indeed the poison which could not deceive m   148.68584133082916
the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugénie s character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking   48.65615053437131
deschamps the family notary   127.01922241782131
we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner   82.52367595644131
monsieur athos do me then the honor to accompany me   73.56994925621171
sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room i have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince   172.01100940243998
e   95.13927081648065
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the world   118.42410867586047
his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows   159.55231292520386
that would occasion a loss of precious time   249.59829679157187
but remember that you are not to strike till i give the signal   189.8507865718604
he would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him   115.68901358651155
without that what would become of me   158.08106062096448
and you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition   123.33658135726752
athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms   154.16907505389912
yes like a clap of thunder   86.31280613971734
the quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition carmela alone objecting to it but the count of san felice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded   99.23948881137784
you are a poisoner   114.02729876735346
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape   12.146730679917937
i have no wishes count   76.49696781937756
midnight struck   181.38379182222303
listen said the doctor   4.293992592279153
tomorrow then monsieur tomorrow   44.26169514150912
haydée said he you well know   185.9571220058595
for the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis and the stingy fellow would only give me eighty   161.49208158590335
do as i bid you show the chevalier out   2.4005398824017306
asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon   158.90404971197927
the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pierrefonds to which porthos escorted his friend   89.64090554925633
the abbé the abbé   183.18732257782642
9   97.50314939878459
besides as m   170.9942738050539
not so replied danglars   54.273236386830696
and you failed   82.79988533921083
saint denis   42.559067712119074
do you pity him   152.8917146247301
i hope so   180.88109787180798
during this passage felton related everything to milady how instead of going to london he had chartered the little vessel   121.88440150365754
besides his probity was irreproachable in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with their religion and their consciences lovers with the rigorous delicacy of our era and the poor with god s seventh commandment   6.0120022773276816
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes   91.88530509983927
however he added turning to porthos i should not regret dying sir were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you   193.51619150078062
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos   82.74215056991835
athos turned pale   68.1305183104169
you do not know her replied the stranger   140.65451803832894
monte cristo was more affectionate than ever indeed his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all   8.830499572163362
morbleu   108.43961322906999
said i   176.07142547242904
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you   119.84893452307388
he was to wait at the gate   121.75227240053452
one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows   214.68919359142126
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy   49.70086957440975
you are right sir said raoul   141.15594237507872
to horse   164.11657945652033
my plan   149.19134177589203
wholly yours aramis   153.40285415089585
i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence   133.10908564511257
the first rendezvous was fixed for the following wednesday at eight o clock in the evening precisely   224.6791446079141
groslow   102.45727113105926
cried raoul courage   89.79803909449853
d artagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands   131.83870913255475
what do you mean to say   78.95414269025952
i am eager to see you attain your vengeance   194.28916063488467
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard   89.56797006778359
nay answered the countess i know no more of him than yourself   133.03961974040456
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said   91.94875236218371
monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor   202.2777311573758
asked the cardinal   120.22895693984007
for my part i should not hesitate a moment   155.7430605846556
and mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the isle of dogs   56.5766055188587
what of that   81.52489975458761
i assure you franz and i were lost in admiration   170.9001572807627
cried the queen   88.36449536984458
i shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me   157.970468582798
descend my lord said the man in the moat   166.78232721566576
and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert s side   172.0188472739358
yes   133.61667449587105
in a moment they were at the canebière   197.00994813072785
so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality   94.62696511413077
said porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face   48.82947508412036
to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me   4.904888694219508
this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king   70.49568356988495
ali had received his instructions and went down the corso crossed the campo vaccino went up the strada san gregorio and reached the gates of st   131.33896945166921
château renaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other   161.3800604723843
his looking glass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition   98.30275741467722
talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos   193.44203128130232
this new tenant who as we have said was an italian was called il signor giacomo busoni   202.1051834558874
and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation   152.63387287204858
what has happened   92.4152439253043
porthos and aramis arose   51.88704199098885
milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vertigo   159.49973761568725
that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness   99.88841878060818
what time do you breakfast albert   76.69727021321276

monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in   101.82403439841319

with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud   124.03372826098136
as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf   43.03524917964282
there has been a misunderstanding   133.90387939453439

they killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summer house overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library   187.00490739124558
bravo viscount said monte cristo smiling   139.62478406741266
it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv   169.2942680860967
it will be as well if he is not answered caderousse   126.30615889087267
said d artagnan taking his friend by the hand   203.78653067384482
now that i see you young and with a promising future now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth   63.78873683595925
the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase   131.05496245481427
gentlemen thus d artagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him   25.100237395588806

his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it immediately   147.14175015065842
to the right said caderousse   180.43582203743424

he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world   131.8864078304959

vulcan   118.57342418560575
andrea shuddered   143.41313444182057
what must then be done   146.9266687141631
my dear monsieur de comminges said d artagnan you will find that my friend monsieur du vallon will go to the most fatal lengths if cardinal mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat   52.47658716378932
everything d artagnan even folly has its limit   171.88002409902072
monte cristo seemed in despair   173.8843803490933
he told me let me think what was it   162.2534528068408
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him   143.64254110181324
he merely repeated his phrase i will go and he went   55.08227550226395
they were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it   115.15236798899929
you have managed my affairs so well that i ought to allow you all the time you require for your own   84.59768486766959
swear to be mute   121.74956861131146
i remember too well   192.68701016828817
pshaw   115.92237256385667
said the duke starting in spite of himself   84.61024566410083
said the listener not through doors but through windows   192.38391080844428
that s it   54.194685642758266
no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression   146.06877259336255
as debray walked towards the window danglars approached his wife   126.02643447761788
all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones   113.5835272002369
as well as you do gentlemen   78.32836234121915
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point   119.91697289773529
he turned it gently on its hinges   81.04914847937712
and do you suppose this will be forgotten   246.83148292958649
and he returned to his companions   45.651712999359646
enough enough   82.02275491281654
yours   98.81901597763041
but interposed monsieur de chavigny it seems to me that pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for mademoiselle de pons   33.94220289749026
why she is the old wife of a procurator of the châtelet monsieur named madame coquenard who although she is at least fifty still gives herself jealous airs   89.75738934356079
porthos was perfectly indifferent   85.8692103386241
said aramis   209.76477931374257
call madame de villefort   265.05383927708
the jailer came in the evening   103.02109820972572
monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moment s reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me   113.57270301168296
it seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss   19.77314317277839
at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of aunay   172.9364708194804
well are you coming   4.284122415455386
but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head   145.8973205722406
willingly replied de chatillon   101.30239335418162
in italy the nobility generally marry young   34.33408449751758
asked milady   217.87217206029086
said d artagnan becoming angry again   82.46038277135764
oh   3.3565967032083677
you shall be my body guard   209.23424998497114
a bark   144.03192630682108
my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated   239.53103090651973
what   75.76407243506125
interrupted d artagnan   248.94609058721912
it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have forgotten   238.8808798363877
he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt appeared   90.67919947838888
as they were passing onward athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city   139.6917373055164
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set   172.4720312319254
i not only confess it but am proud of it returned the gascon   159.8419130593494
what is it sir   105.30705919874218
de tréville in his office contiguous to this antechamber received visits listened to complaints gave his orders and like the king in his balcony at the louvre had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms   70.6505313239799
but is this all you have to say to me   175.3078089935542
he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint laurent and advanced to the consigne   145.85013960275663
would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills   227.53520929305478
i did   206.25439502877452
enough   136.9854594417034
but the queen is sacred and if anyone speaks of her let it be respectfully   91.97708102651337
replied danglars   115.0615967870697
alas alas alas   117.11661333039459
stay here is another louis for you   62.45415684268672
you really mean to declare that such is not your intention   238.39227327434185
asked m   114.32370146021412
de monte cristo   157.02286905613826
my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession   155.87911817264228
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness   115.52130228258282
this time it was not a host but a hostess who received him   131.87996980380575
after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak   198.55232791921193
come come with me gentlemen   48.59890626849976
would you like a proof of it   128.8792936667624
she thought felton had told all   65.82880147883722
in the name of heaven explain yourself   113.43388265324181
justice before everything   124.54230046205112
the bonnes fortunes of de tréville were talked of as those of m   151.29471858185207
you shall have all madame   8.62386578912492
die in peace   81.09714619983934
you were too young to know about such things   154.5720297589476
well never mind answered caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while danglars had merely sipped his   39.49049050265887
that your mother and m   10.88207095940767
d artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine india linen to implore her pardon   188.306329769616
after some minutes the door opened and a footman announced mademoiselle paulet   214.728785546141
his companions followed his example   213.77455125767398
he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends returned   130.95446295867842
milady asked some questions about the carriage   223.13967027603326
what must be done   140.4879351075391
good   70.31099357885876
you are right sir replied the governor   168.61735345488034
asked mazarin   38.196210643402836
edward cried m   115.34083543245546
bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by terror   86.20760286672129
well i will mention you to him   130.63208521198132
no replied d artagnan   182.10891200772465
a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent   61.71754130711314
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him   117.78745137321985
resounded on all sides   219.8870887701919
furnished with this plunder andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes   137.11915250932302
luigi vampa himself searched   145.64124128690398
ordinarily m   118.53327430746313
well said the jailer are you more reasonable today   172.6880904300266
news from your father do you hear henrietta   187.64478877400222
anne hesitated   113.78237105491243
he aimed a terrible blow at d artagnan who avoided it by springing to one side   102.56080572485028
his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion   110.24143121106269
i do not at all wonder at it one can not think of everything   131.31274361170202
they said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon   135.1437073554877
and at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode   66.80532386402575
if it was mme   10.160453662602379
well be it so   59.234908657870264
cried d artagnan   198.597780650977
in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him   133.42029344465274
lieutenant with a promise of becoming captain   130.3149456466334
did you not tell him just now that you wanted money   106.86775975197453
yes replied aramis i am extremely careful of my appearance   130.21984204122944
d artagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made his untimely entrance   154.21256251734383
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires   58.957650268170575
alone valentine has no power   161.97418769222654
and you shall have it   50.71981212677626
it is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed   36.58621171889773
i am   117.56615194847451
and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will speak   77.03040792078559
m   188.92170029848637
there was no fear of her falling asleep   140.29804247175647
if you know a prayer say it for you are condemned and you shall die   108.95225709106768
straw work   74.64491053929247
m   214.7272186651888
and now said d artagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope you are going to let me into your secret   97.37814214055926
what   132.42340092660726
this is serious answered the three friends   202.4608810391215
the old man s interrogative eye said which   106.48717995068615
returned the turnkey   108.60682253576026
answer then   142.38992557033768
you ask that   110.33607961810144
count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the rospoli palace   133.11781941742456
he had tried his strength to the utmost   210.38433732145035
i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers   96.46651881278959
he only satisfied himself by milady s pulse that the case was not serious   135.0032315729868
said aramis to athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante chamber   114.7411858382607
but to return to our millions   33.12377105051921
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon   101.7442607694452
d avrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then m   114.01723987222663
fair said athos is she not   125.11809216601581
the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner   96.3602155718433
said d artagnan   43.64023529306709
my grief will kill me of itself   209.80074171741416
i leave it to monsieur d artagnan to name them my lord   74.94092195934704
corbleu   86.8445538906318
but fernand was mistaken   67.98270733744363
i think i hear a noise she said   164.95613885668035
the beggar the evening passed on   117.2709368393775
and he is very rich   95.37465942860132
the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly twenty paces from him   161.09516726829116
adieu till we meet again   99.8043728277297
gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most likely   216.5089657397629
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work   121.71233797321297
i never had one   95.62764926406341
the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder   67.15734970093314
mazarin bent low before her   190.08795912860188
and i answered him to bring or send me that order and i would sign it   33.28519923115789
it is closed after them and they are arrested   28.827180521434116
we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening   172.11484310305696
he therefore mounted his horse and disappeared   142.16687400138238
be so kind as to reflect sire said the cardinal   93.05002506707454
he was dead   92.36860634284194
a piece of bread was brought and jacopo offered him the gourd   126.0635476678977
i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition   144.39790235422544
de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house   110.23251875085231
and the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing loudly   91.76478057487245
i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said haydée quietly   154.71512168184626
he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door keepers or the coolness of his colleagues   171.58877284488622
none at all   87.94810130611718
porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep   78.2437339355503
well   155.98778253063415
it is no uncommon thing in italy   62.99586590103284
and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos   146.28799554352975
but in france they are considered in very bad taste   160.12086758133958
now hate me if you can   125.5269539971382
as to king charles the question must be viewed differently   95.05371115884537
and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal   161.38160086407663
he shall not come in before i am gone said he   142.5393871342594
bonacieux dead and to d artagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life   19.36149788344622
i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you   167.02915382019864
the breakfast and what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast   1.2407832417968478
about the papers   57.503619513969994
nay it must have been a promise   173.9215975881538
the answer to madame s replied kitty all in a tremble   163.6485900877026
resumed mazarin with his artful smile   158.1447107029127
it is frank at least said morrel   21.690813593597554
to day flatter and caress or you are only a common woman   242.63284954408874
before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and bertuccio with terror   41.46652019281774
friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of notre dame   118.19212426535293
with this consoling idea i leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you   139.52257809545563
slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo   167.74702995655497
yes undoubtedly the abbé busoni himself replied monte cristo   277.96234202839656
it goes without saying that when he saw a huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion   219.50916380515386
the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry   140.74589939406803
oh nothing   81.70564687361423
but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more i don t doubt   170.0445487421182
a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings   210.41027338145273
where is the prisoner   182.60436515904377
laugh if you will   94.83937277667589
well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at paris   7.993603359322066
i am incredulous   160.88195206892544
mercédès and albert were in that room   62.32182444450565
what a confounded long time this first act lasts   52.84567871596564
he leaped towards a dressing room near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailor s jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair   118.935015935568
the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced   98.27586626781441
but she murdered the woman i loved   192.75237167311758
be ready said porthos as he slipped through the opening   137.21805331263621
what is he then   241.1476776345765
oh count have pity upon me   109.64265675919991
well but he is a charming young man according to my ideas   110.2892882500656
teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies   136.33861829702457
the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain   156.3337349894067
the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger   88.02217613873067
porthos had been trying a new horse   264.71390404613294
certes replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle   169.1386356357088
a skilful preparation of my friend s the worthy abbé adelmonte who taught me the use of it   117.81199595930295
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative   100.80858766728409
yes madame replied the officer   60.652390104979446
m   141.4422278907144
i could not repeat the signals   150.53710759689568
well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch   148.30865766280806
because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road   163.23782837320059
forgive me replied morrel   49.46439099570949
if any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an irish gentleman   149.3843477767544
porthos made a sign of assent   67.29144544348023
but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose   142.58196964208653
cried albert   186.69175229708014
i take them said d artagnan for myself   6.820202563723541
asked valentine timidly   49.93360077184741
then in a menacing tone he said sir   107.53464333036732
well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which i offer you so much for the world   12.538539251350343
stay   16.803870697333068
her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by well arched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno   164.61497612792172
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression   144.86411338202907
1   139.58241758520035
sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword   74.73369639536361
mademoiselle danglars was still the same cold beautiful and satirical   125.14566425129271
ah said i after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink   80.31553903983976
said d artagnan laughing in spite of himself   139.68401799229167
he then repaired to d artagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own   1.8545128436323637
the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied thank you monsieur le curé i accept   28.92569950762706
the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun   113.17310967025473
well if you should be restored to favor don t forget me   213.39933744552346
the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury   67.76327091687719
d artagnan who had secured the key shut himself up in the closet without reply   143.93651664966006
look look cried the count seizing the young men s hands   31.59330568455684
but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible   77.16406039712886
the deed if you please mr   158.80999667093383
ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested   108.4750028965189
but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary   158.58512938887608
come   235.025322018211
oh my god my god   95.8510558899126
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed   52.7555563645968
my lord have you any commands   202.11554930450538
athos and d artagnan went out while planchet was sent to inquire if there were not three horses for sale in the neighborhood   66.80623411530487
this exclamation which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder   90.86455066127206
asked the count   78.71187630845654
noirtier s room   69.70847688169374
ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor   97.00105542923153
scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation   72.559512493787
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee   120.07924769996819
the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice   53.481215256174195
but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which having no other name was called borgo   81.22661210905372
his praises increased raoul s friendship twofold   191.00914959006485
said athos emptying and refilling his glass   193.22560632932027
felton did not enter   16.573810661817078
pray have compassion upon me and do not take up every word i say   121.6385528981924
we say almost for the idea that a young handsome kind and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love but on the contrary strengthens it   161.86922709457633
captivity the fifth day chapter lvii   138.7630345951083
yes said d artagnan athos is right it must be burned   154.56591286936464
bravo   131.02662337996907
we have already asked that question said château renaud for none of us has seen him   191.89546059676124
let us follow him said de guiche   128.74940213514202
this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause   173.03734502073405
to that question i can answer positively   55.38655365701939
the soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him   32.407257220489356
he did get out nevertheless   63.18780583966865
can you enlighten me on that point   85.76946762014806
athos always carried the key of this coffer about him   153.9433947916886
yes devotion   25.084556382225628
for i have found the means of strangling this hydra   38.19025007606989
meditate and consider as much as you like replied porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn   150.3831683563245
indeed i feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a first rate paris tailor probably blin or humann   159.89836244222136
i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months i shall be an officer or dead   136.86958677734452
for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures   74.78556696288959
come back as ambassador come back as minister come back surrounded with guards who will defend you with servants who will watch over you and then i shall no longer fear for your days and i shall be happy in seeing you   120.80916969475251
my faith monsieur he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me   244.07978111706586
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands   78.28751632678077
it is that there was with her majesty the queen of england a gentleman who when i pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy   169.19470513679755
what   80.88378977418394
never had he been so well received   186.3903520538277
suddenly we heard loud cries   29.317186552373272
if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose   98.68143422123262
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this   193.78361845028064
how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the count of monte cristo went out by the barrière d enfer taking the road to orléans   175.8771822610051
you follow the world my young friend and i tremble lest grace prove not efficacious   121.13152192028427
impossible   115.27317987911213
and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together   97.08003832053598
said he   115.48715169668453
the story interests you does it not sir   178.07835345250658
the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house   73.3771761951856
asked porthos   89.42525023380897
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project   30.844349760991804
and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions   79.50395798691297
for a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous sea serpent of the constitutionnel   85.64230083593068
he is a quaker then   174.7726711307717
very good said groslow and opened the door of the room   114.86564036375583
on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand   38.9387493175857
your mother would die of grief   127.1093334448665
you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your forehead   93.1128892635189
the utility of stovepipes it was evident that without suspecting it and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection   215.98292957967476
marie michon was a very aristocratic person   187.73011009529364
de tréville thought it best to be first in making the complaint   199.27747332107072
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand   143.37314982117877
chapter xlii   90.40742588887271
but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son   171.89253826169
you may perhaps have hidden a thought   164.18212554979698
raising my scaffold   155.7537538226318
well then take him said the cardinal   63.9241039154242
the terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her   61.46119668062501
franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion   64.89541042773772
d artagnan then related all the mad passion of milady and her menaces of death   19.42499239753107
and the edicts   101.73055884883615
and as i was about to say by the word of bonacieux i have confidence in you   106.36296993015793
your engagement was for breakfast then   86.50024727167006
yes   180.81601920495484
i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at rome i who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence   139.77182342577947
because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you   206.07168088553402
the carriage was taking the direct road to it   155.62348004160367
five hundred roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married   68.63956194510943
the devil   223.89417229065455
at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside   123.58740363348491
and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so   160.05101185220997
and then she added in a low voice oh heavens what will befall me   154.34838068213918
the fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off   148.45498953089552
but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in   282.2542101968629
we want to ask something else of you   162.81996171986964
the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles   152.31748825042646
at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard   120.2779497798087
he spoke the romaic language did he   158.89935611133936
the only question was had she ten or twelve   71.05510001014858
there was a moment s silence then the carriage cleared the gate   135.22175997672554
his face was furrowed with wrinkles   35.2627012498061
ay and a very fine one   133.24222181252625
whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against you   156.66374406548792
you have seen him then   116.52983406553967
true dantès i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father the lovely mercédès   143.93153411272306
at his country house   107.41064576260332
we may sleep tranquilly   85.11233535728168
was seen yesterday at gabrielle s   142.23800920500446
it is that next to you bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe   173.23136363425826
philosophy m   68.11929262050796
and what is that   43.582280654187926
then he stepped into his coupé calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes   52.687903616677914
but do not breathe to a living soul sir the rendezvous which i give you   106.57263734369515
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself   221.08225182102106
as he alighted he thought he saw his father s pale face behind the curtain of the count s bedroom   115.4647449010489
someone was heard in the corridor   154.43050799333128
at three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old worm eaten table was a tall young man of twenty or two and twenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled   158.40241529053037
nevertheless he pressed d artagnan s hand and said to him you are an honest youth   147.5853745101943
let him pass   112.70450992059587
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right albert s breakfast room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden   162.53642990555335
monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i   39.42526759049704
m   110.8999817301284
no for porthos will pay you   147.68033553627404
we have only the vulture to deal with   30.343549567755147
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him   77.67470125667461
i will call for them   78.9165607089467
that is to say the half that was left you understand   67.90439782625981
he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant   174.87976943909575
morcerf asked leave to retire   137.90912567116607
yes have you breakfasted   179.2499995012034
morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly   96.87010469670662
i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you as i do   33.51343074502002
you positively recognize m   222.86924978608525
asked he   191.1215050795534
i   40.59306936377203
they can t be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse   160.666564960114
but do you understand   141.49448325458673
good god cried kitty there is my mistress calling me   279.7339183346927
the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment   29.39076986014723
not at all said d artagnan   138.64389953008344
yes   103.51671224309024
am i to consider this as part of my income on account   162.32294598129977
but said franz in his turn interrupting his host s meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was   113.36827031799744
yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious   167.93189852598402
listen   76.45728618459654
kitty fearing she was ill hastened toward her and was beginning to open her dress   248.0522145986661
well this is what actually took place one evening after an orgy in reinard s apartment at the tuileries with the duc d harcourt fontrailles de rieux and others the duc d harcourt proposed that we should go and pull cloaks on the pont neuf   161.8945189563923
ah you do not know with what i am threatened   110.77592857824
then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress   26.038150639485266
no it is not finished   178.77566536350247
0239m it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation   243.0747818671275
and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city   17.565505036292635
basset   112.88732365552956
i will say continued the count that he followed and watched you the whole time and when he saw you leave the house ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself   156.09435059181124
we will talk italian and spanish   52.73777478786748
of how much does he rob you every year   169.76109997512296
said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right   215.56405859715258
to brussels if you like   109.12947866294263
said the light horseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds   65.19283059420275
d artagnan gave the open letter to kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time   56.220402227955894
the king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation   213.26595543459229
i will efface that blot on my father s character   159.69503795785045
the king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude   149.42687877832554
however it may be valentine you must not be alarmed   94.80200339000496
there are your horses   94.98271876204699
without divulging his secret dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent   99.13688062181922
i tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded   132.6418562750444
evening came and still with all the patient solicitude of a mother she watched for his return   138.0439913604059
to transport me for life how merciful   229.32427938814544
insolent   199.23762583605009
there ought to be some money in that secretaire   191.0889218696436
for instance that the queen would have a son   137.03207720689628
probably   141.51587511876622
d artagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything   25.869149597518543
consider said aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven   202.1992824574098
you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars in order that i may execute edmond s last wishes   107.44587292894249
the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and saint méran coffins   124.04038862718133
do you then regret nothing   142.05528802602808
he saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance   54.85434162284493
demanded d artagnan   18.997249343590283
d artagnan s bearing became still more imposing   136.55598661764134
na ne ni no yes yes yes said the old man s eye   103.07866434932458
but happily for you you serve an all powerful master   201.34790829528873
the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one   128.49349672872287
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat   88.6199512805928
not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready money   83.61898976696246
he is a coward   121.00701969634189
yes said madame danglars that is she   179.0265558493079
noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak   60.575082005740114
and the cards i ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house   61.41508354346024
without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to know   15.222219356310262
no   103.31910701769168
you talk like a noodle my friend said caderousse   160.74498729624793
germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom d artagnan had often remarked this   148.45207570652406
i understand what you say   96.08661234809503
thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice   164.27331433960813
said the queen   94.42311050398337
a retired baker my poor benedetto is rich he has an annuity   174.20249376201218
oh then some pledge of your indulgence some object which came from you and may remind me that i have not been dreaming   197.28514632921917
and she fell back weeping into her daughter s arms   75.30418885544617
parbleu   171.4019495365635
if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba   209.2319652458971
how my friend planchet   33.976135028315525
i knew his father m   129.25349795147835
for the rest as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days if porthos were still at the great st   102.26658620134054
they fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon   155.69408014117187
it is you tréville   165.11350065401209
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her   198.1578303902985
said danglars to andrea   139.08454740634926
they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to d artagnan   68.79995894161937
but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted   12.928392323072856
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words   126.00041403335096
danglars is to see mademoiselle eugénie settled   141.15520172220718
well said morcerf for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppæa while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl   98.13936661640409
olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly   18.90460942406071
my god   129.47738402043507
are you going to marry mademoiselle danglars   134.17656954948285
yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits   61.61816557776445
who has told me this fine story monsieur   186.76177722204596
the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments   180.07203934328692
patience said the abbé in a tone which made the dying man shudder   138.6854839533377
but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm   163.04566639697018
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs   156.8689863035159
tell haydée said he that i will take coffee with her and give her to understand that i desire permission to present one of my friends to her   146.4093666034509
then with a sigh poor haydée   100.66772692001031
and that applies very well to you   117.86632428967968
you only wished to imprison him   136.86380723498934
make haste dear lodger said he   62.33776953359436
like women not like queens   237.05478883121603
in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man   111.64458537942575
and i give you absolution beforehand   177.49780684733
that m   214.11333488813108
the sailors looked at one another   199.19790592341465
remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors   153.915835433641
cried d artagnan tell us all about it   47.40573198240517
come then as early as you like at seven o clock   121.46368507207174
the very same   131.77544533174213
a change   7.1380948929795665
29 the carolina not virginia jessamine gelsemium sempervirens properly speaking not a jessamine at all has yellow blossoms   16.960305062534573
said the duke this is a bad day or rather a bad night to be out late   40.44047318507896
he is as well as you and i   205.21058744150088
ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter n   39.311498362355024
don t dream it athos   94.31691462845498
don t imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner   153.41262166555023
i have always served you faithfully cried bertuccio in despair   229.07807655203493
he was desirous of an explosion because in that case the mine throws forth fire and fire enlightens   121.46875984941401
for i had forgotten him said the lieutenant   210.98899646778986
said the swiss   55.83385381385683
murmured the dying man that they may not separate us if you save me   124.63541601836035
if beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will the satisfaction to you will be the same   62.75528691185458
and planchet took his place in d artagnan s suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed   122.82322039358905
the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast   197.86700205754244
wonderfully said d artagnan   255.46381275368572
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano   206.32731412468308
ah monsieur   85.45911210375986
the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence   129.90130631847993
you dislike him i think   66.67044934805241
and yet i should have preferred you will have the pleasure of the surprise   99.45340500403367
as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more   46.04974371311681
if i wish to leave   89.05062303034293
parliament can never have passed such an act as that   125.9108607902606
say no more about it   128.3083829370976
i have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a european misfortune   139.14251804030243
then he went into the stable   164.27681783369775
i mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplace i mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes   164.08414026555647
oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm   101.03443287475835
he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street   109.89764800509957
a murder do you call it   113.93721159911173
oh no   122.82322302608294
hush   130.20821136418212
it is done cried she wiping away her tears and resuming her firmness i am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of shame   154.5420777813502
tell me have you ever thought that seven times 1 700 000 francs make nearly twelve millions   189.3657086135203
no replied athos   79.91889933675202
asked the marquise   148.396831158401
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale   114.30945130313148
he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow   45.85679083447627
she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and porthos   93.57355841294826
if i am to remain here permanently as monsieur mazarin has kindly given me to understand i must provide myself with a diversion for my old age i must turn gourmand   162.89254742733425
yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders   12.779618706596835
and the coadjutor and madame de longueville   47.56659170266664
and the young officer shook the count s hand so warmly that monte cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure   57.22222274546234
question him about the fight said athos   147.10502991609823
for different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all and it was therefore agreed that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating house in the rue de la monnaie of the sign of the hermitage   120.18358467329412
ah sir   51.707469386659554
at any rate i think so   120.48909002463924
saying at the same time you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you   107.34703874326507
you persist then   83.19680347091881
the old man winked violently   81.03043906259776
the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission   67.43719159493529
and on the contrary i think i have not proved myself worthy of your goodness   90.8268539359639
and if i had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at nîmes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings   155.95837018504443
you are wisdom incarnate athos aramis replied   143.1191860538222
did he not make a million in spaniards this last year   124.298645981349
said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required   74.06971096542958
the queen   139.51448784071113
that is why i hastened to you   74.42308322659315
what is the matter then with this dear child   120.2263427876658
would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret   133.19658771005896
he cast his eyes again on the letter   134.78329694161343
i do not wish to come between a father and son   113.25273887848253
he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land   157.0285944701474
near the merchant s signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor   123.77870791275964
his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life survived   131.89080692263323
enter marseilles at night and your house by the back door and there remain quiet submissive secret and above all inoffensive   46.80507191839769
speak make haste   91.03892487950154
why by your marchioness your duchess your princess   75.87204091477479
said milady smiling   65.13624205919622
well commenced   59.936501036744374
how does he call himself   127.42051250748813
thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their companions   286.49935350206124
they spread their cloaks   46.34284942442255
devil of a man corsican that you are always mysteries or superstitions   79.0641926741813
and d artagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in anne s hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty   166.05764755247625
ah ah   136.69639693080646
having aroused the enmity of the sultan he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822 at the age of eighty   85.50792648995305
aramis shook his head   159.1922106998057
it is enough   76.51563403458127
m   89.28453585609681
courage   32.101527128421594
and as his head is valued at a thousand roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch him   0.04641943115031211
said monte cristo   67.87877483036696
all at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes   131.1543220847845
i understand said porthos   185.75958633300039
in the regiment said d artagnan he is called porthos the queen started but his true name is the chevalier du vallon   105.06025423441285
then you were going to rueil   117.03590875474812
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart   100.02056884088256
ah   173.13713534565306
when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear   112.62561567349407
it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini that i did not sooner assist you in your distress   60.42107212226297
day was now advanced   2.1568175139140635
are you sure   98.73365624861646
and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and m   101.19397495292554

albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him   105.6467976264911

monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty it s true but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in him he is conceited and stupid   155.206534760838
i have replied d artagnan   76.87133005223475
my lord said d artagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinary that is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible   90.56892913192308

haydée may hear you perhaps   184.19884091480316
on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars   72.32670071448928
on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger   19.501703610660428
it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer   120.66773940508574

at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand   62.60448165854747
the approach was not such as to prepossess people an ill smelling dark passage a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard   125.2506306902682
the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin   10.419688693886727

said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly   64.22010716009046
but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days   132.44213237527225
my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil   81.2534821826147

to you the only just good and compassionate being i have met with   33.039333152679546

the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu   122.11754984534588
gentlemen said the queen laughing pray take up your abode in the chateau   59.931498195707846
porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play   6.80574375569185
danglars took advantage of caderousse s temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint victor staggering as he went   97.19510393792298
is there a window in the dressing room   86.41683931632939
my lord replied guitant i was observing that we live in troublous times and that to day s events are very like those in the days of the ligue of which i heard so much in my youth   89.4446881328864

was mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen   277.64119243984834
your excellency will do as you please   170.0412172837938
the pretty madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing porthos s words for she thought the scene with the swiss was about to be repeated   139.5622013816927
d artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table   76.77507336890926
there s a fellow who will never desert me   135.0033961696565
and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place   124.93473629040079
while blancmesnil who was arrested at the same time but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or noise was safe in the castle of vincennes   198.7968692780989
and from there if it please god to france where at least i understand the architecture of the houses   128.54918247763447
a moment later he came down again holding in his hand the small shagreen case which he opened to assure himself it contained the diamond seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in then as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his head   116.07394188780853
but now we are alone what are you going to say   7.082011332572634
and i replied franz will tell you as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called aladdin   190.81943009088764
i now repeat that i was born at auteuil on the night of the 27th of september 1817 and that i am the son of the procureur m   57.819365237636816

but that was not all   98.11301112731724
on reaching her room eugénie locked her door while louise fell on a chair   207.6538587014375

and since he has chosen me as his interpreter i will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions   120.20499985389543
the right of pardoning only applies to the guilty said tréville who was determined to have the last word and my musketeer is innocent   161.54679326215555

franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes   203.78114440900822
and what does it amount to after all   95.09485080176157
of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams   124.49801854199634
this athos was connected with three young musketeers named porthos d artagnan and he stopped short   24.23904969780024
but can you not say that sir   75.82345576214695
six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was   98.99648160450197
a thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the count of monte cristo but i suppose that m   248.6228656594656
asked bertuccio   75.27978135505387
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so   220.8677786282571
ah ah murmured he is dantès then a member of some carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form   241.7040145634465
monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions   133.88710102433697
but no said valentine no i tell you it is all past and it was nothing   139.72101260183032
their signature is worth five per cent   190.39741878742538
the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous   70.88239295011218
sir said he up to this time and it is now more than four and twenty years since i received the direction of this house from my father who had himself conducted it for five and thirty years never has anything bearing the signature of morrel son been dishonored   99.59191162996463
said bonacieux you are a jocular companion   161.15149310703492
dantès repeated he edmond dantès   73.65480211531542
the abbé then showed dantès the sketch he had made for their escape   140.1918643151958
cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the banker s house   172.81953138977912
conduct us my lord to the wall   164.06371921710524
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women   23.076907266336278
he is in vendome where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris   99.10463575164306
i rely on you valentine said morrel   202.11420561623368
there were two means of gaining his object to search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the trench   103.2258822120892
asked comminges who putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness   173.87544310003685
sire said athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman   143.48433949138135
you will sell this diamond   121.91985419848608
returned bertuccio in deep contempt   83.02007591256162
from tours   154.51290234931326
let us see the dungeons   50.233700848689764
having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dantès the latter of whom attracted universal notice   26.924623045691263
where did the army cross the lys   135.41334085753795
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know   28.67896056672987
what is your name   154.3914588468001
you are only betrayed   104.32360949035586
but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing   54.64581456677082
bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king   56.37413500054495
adieu madame replied the king s attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door   46.41299154982431
the physician has a sacred mission on earth   93.27122073188244
said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me   122.95290994397958
although weakened the young man s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners liberty   166.8928877064182
morrel guessed all this   66.47806331157085
in that case i shall expect m   166.40308155081152
at last we are off   41.12858403333509
chapter 6   38.5230598999689
a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him   123.62174152855063
well well don t be angry my boy   147.89455278362354
the precaution of changing our clothes   49.90673742106996
if your majesty is so said tréville we are   8.025436334244773
here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores   91.64696393814185
do not be alarmed said beauchamp   149.0069419376398
morrel looked at the count with surprise   169.6236563213534
there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse   144.77916079562868
pardieu   167.04038104550136
you must be mad my friend said the baroness   251.16859929215886
indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place   113.92650299740093
come   92.87465510624509
holloa   88.82959342577499
valentine looked at m   129.48390762816487
there fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material love that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption   100.6540126921915
the second followed and descended from the plateau   115.3630813783998
well let us see what is to be derived from this gloss   91.76960943186108
what do i think   203.05884767528843
but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to paris so that if the messengers and the spies had failed his eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed   198.41532433159628
a giant had seized also aramis s two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp   79.10723831890223
several times lord de winter porthos or aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak   99.51609446127078
only if the queen has the studs which i very much doubt count them sire and if you only find ten ask her majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here   34.108732654346625
he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peter s by daylight   130.8037195000231
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle   99.64720923789831
not so   58.91299797661311
ay that smells good   229.28878786089723
on them depended my father s life replied she   56.06001593424269
but your father was not allowed to fall   186.01740763068395
help help   130.90720258063968
on the contrary said d artagnan we shall hear better   221.31117434373493
i know that replied the englishman   45.25715007936748
they are like a great child who only wants humoring   82.45318165555567
then he said to himself i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody   126.2506078294544
and i feel no doubt that thanks to d artagnan s ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts   200.2242860717367
i agree monsieur   71.05658199317722
morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency   103.23362664452279
never   49.825418402881496
yes monseigneur said d artagnan   64.966322016783
there seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king louis xviii   115.24028293841735
nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them   143.33611215092174
that purse contained sixty pistoles   24.63298259577533
chapter ix   20.688640338443747
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared   56.560847118515646
mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered my lord the queen henrietta maria accompanied by an english noble is entering the palais royal at this moment   166.4558008231063
juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his confession   43.886279682708164
albert and château renaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first   188.04627029938558
i never knew till now the delight of speed said morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow   147.49602797884134
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects   82.25586475502377
the son of marie michon   175.2969180214256
besides you forget cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two   78.7406958595632
he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated   110.97541007235432
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you   150.87993735803414
now d herblay said athos dismount and come here   110.48265407011195
take my last gold muttered danglars holding out his pocket book and let me live here   213.41819295340264
but you will not stop to have your wound dressed   225.8162730246942
besides we are in a situation to overlook ceremony   53.39906823245592
you understand tréville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all   114.0506188076191
i understand   103.4275464908298
too much reality would always remain in my recollection   17.830332056302694
but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman s word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be so   112.6026497859471
he knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that   155.57777338336552
you will not interfere in anything   205.19190954556223
ah indeed   77.55758009961806
in politics my dear fellow you know as well as i do there are no men but ideas no feelings but interests   95.81124845164675
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with château renaud and beauchamp   105.6913449074837
oh oh   87.8185233195544
to be sure   19.4279751672573
sighed bazin   183.26154588403034
said the young man   83.27104576955965
paris this odious paris waking up one morning without queen or king surrounded besieged famished having for its sole resource its stupid parliament and their coadjutor with crooked limbs   147.4394647919861
who said it was a crime   237.45033624912008
eh   180.75309230477166
the young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution   146.4971949276717
women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris   205.7490507401419
between saint venant and aire   99.30220722676772
then she cried ahem   195.3052399574168
she would have cut your throat and after that everybody else s   178.242030251344
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive   33.85286886861992
and where is the dear boy our little edmond   99.65611838252667
look said he is it not strange   15.18305823939042
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said albert   114.28074981167413
yes   163.5396506508077
she exclaimed   77.2097331010606
exactly like me   193.68521710183927
i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m   102.0616711008351
yes betrayed by the scotch amongst whom i was born whom i have always loved better than the english   194.7932012016417
it is well madame i believe your oath   88.88938511582123
oh my mother it was you who said you were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen   69.40904534390185
the duke is english   129.33780314246926
we shall search for some madame and i think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some together   116.50337045121833
he found edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless   124.25674638475586
you heard what the count just said and also my reply   72.41369694368791
swear to be united in spite of everything and forever and may this oath bind us to each other and even also our descendants   148.24398646924772
you really vilify me   116.94741270429671
let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough   134.66330964072463
no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her   75.70244191012654
well m   13.359747751795382
may i depend on it   93.86034769428898
i shall get nothing from these fools he muttered   125.64768520729024
well i think andrea stopped and looked around   119.15027622424097
said old dantès   180.9973459724825
you are the best companion that i know d artagnan he said offering his hand to the gascon   41.833335711327535
it can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts   34.78185539753926
but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love   26.227088189490942
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left d artagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything   117.6367067108302
but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left albert started for naples   40.21805174535042
ings have been made   150.60997952805292
i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france   98.14347742102481
then we shall pay the more that s all i see plainly enough   126.59168219573746
this evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate   203.58628596099226
i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome   112.02829443786321
that is the crime of which i accuse her   151.45317752494603
he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear   182.54062947179997
58   149.01021150250156
then m   142.7226916664332
he credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself   149.2135482610621
one question first   72.02148826381723
the young man uttered a groan but appeared resigned   96.92241688421959
the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano   100.55709282337128
and as i said before let us speak of yourself   88.78675630045551
yes replied anne but you know why and how i see you   71.59483734227702
when she recovered her father was by her side   107.97663892127828
ah i would give much to have five hundred louis only   124.07837960404756
they advanced to the plain   94.94061306230086
he took his way toward the hôtel of m   130.1200515857096
excellent   80.09151960099865
here said he to him are the diamond studs that you came to bring   160.0959800567408
oh i resolved that it should take place as soon as possible   170.71398198453937
you were speaking of the champs élysées just now worthy foster father   118.6841152453605
but does your grace know that the name of charlotte backson is not the true name of this young woman   74.41374358528778
by the queen s almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring   62.20143895773239
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry   255.26438807998335
you watch while i sleep and you have come to bring me some news   154.48262287215084
would not one say he was speaking of a religious community   177.85022794567342
yes yes signed noirtier   59.478650698233004
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for d artagnan and an ace for himself   17.0695352710824
well said aramis beaten by fate   101.30964983633874
his eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tiger cat he advanced toward the hedge   121.27812968713654
well baron what is there difficult to understand about that   84.1295133190552
he was about to marry a young and charming woman whom he loved not passionately but reasonably as became a deputy attorney of the king   78.78984088591415
continued d artagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other   133.38669359720757
monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies   56.80564687424481
and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do   68.08602869355451
had m   137.82243344111723
she was very pale   50.51725626713538
he had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later louis xiv   127.2997192059025
you have asked for me   88.89528837216636
the company looked at each other in consternation   208.0516027435012
that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine   83.44141153174584
in an instant the horse s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam   207.99213117033696
yes replied the narrator   183.01851306409247
d artagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward   100.87409899611768
he turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner   93.85347940125652
and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks   141.302420825557
about what   80.14702932531398
his beard which was darker than his hair was turned carefully with a curling iron a practice that greatly improved it   167.1341685810378
one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening for i have seen his servant   153.24080538966757
and will you make the same promise to my love   134.84945878339872
she is gone said he   144.6193267750189
he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man   120.81688628816912
i wish what god wills   167.22354374830135
with anne of austria for that affair was over but he had to adjust matters for m   46.00301301564399
i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers   128.9082591726092
villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him   176.7979157699594
and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres   160.34364077879215
that s the reason why i take such care you shall not deprive me of mine   2.2864233849506377
we traversed greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates   135.42670598590297
we need not say she stopped at the first floor   74.676938822627
the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian   143.85339329345757
my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father who was glancing anxiously around   90.96966109383243
exclaimed porthos without supper   132.56395602118062
asked the king   53.160166506255806
but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you   13.804753899670402
the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly to give you pleasure my sweet renée i promise to show all the lenity in my power   131.5418566075545
for a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him   103.54530635147644
the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtier s lips seemed to start from his eyes   179.08346860784513
and she made a sign for kitty to leave the room   97.52168644744796
however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply   76.15050215603854
well what would you have me do   131.4790590080998

this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d artagnan who however placed himself between him and them   144.85758692809952

vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone   179.9104512749427
the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of monte cristo   196.435814468711

in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of memory   156.4315827588706
for if you return home safely then then   38.87101832874043

an opal colored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue ocean   108.68943079267603
he had forgotten that   182.40436031146035

but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey   91.82145094252706
the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects   117.1324928500293
i am glad to see you are of my opinion   96.37807804362144

i mean the russian prince who you said had 30 000 livres and we only found 22 000   112.28409091357165
but how could a dose prepared for m   100.55659064131996
you have at some wicket of the louvre a concierge who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would mme   81.34585230293075
madame de villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange preliminaries   83.9176841091176
milady held out her hand to him   37.655126514730256
you were looking the other way   40.183092008164266
are you a friend of villefort s   38.59778240957266
noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse   251.70017812733246
the sergeant called his two patrons with an energetic hem   150.81128941671116
sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language   39.462799447387724
she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and madame danglars was recognized   55.036899286224184
i dressed myself as quickly as possible   74.31978164230198
it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied   163.53455721631147
at any rate said porthos i am glad to hear d artagnan admit that he is afraid   87.91742943357524
yes horse   118.86670113853003
that is unfortunate returned monte cristo   98.95291460162136
the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged   51.647218440712464
but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself   172.2692863495245
said dantès wiping his brow with his sleeve   41.82244754262716
impudent fellow   160.89619439476903
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow   209.80355507166644
oh yes   69.48209328461368
at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor   201.2141136229411
asked felton in a sharp tone   175.09437938671948
i must sleep at beaucaire   146.15692573810526
or rather i will go for him myself   137.05328382511075
asked d artagnan   18.323950076261497
said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me   177.23483661428048
a folded paper fell from edward s breast   105.88000818382852
but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night   95.83376911718203
but milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to him   11.186745121084812
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and d artagnan turned to him   233.63176208333556
meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of   101.24791440494508
but they are on the track   19.18998629860249
he said to porthos   51.47775933650078
this d artagnan   52.634429343329174
how much do i owe this gracious prince   222.41697495993594
de monte cristo is our enemy   154.21758310656386
be it so then replied athos sorrowfully   140.47765215536552
what is her name   10.011530090148923
ah   39.84638408113632
what do you say m   195.240294884265
as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about   103.96148675428559
so that when you went on board the pharaon everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand   155.6222341451806
i salute you marie michon to this letter was added an order conceived in these terms at the louvre august 10 1628 the superior of the convent of béthune will place in the hands of the person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage   98.63763760674846
madame de villefort was dead   175.42898344753314
don t trouble yourself to reveal your good luck   97.61516777092615
that s right that s right dantès   33.25683264212587
your excellency s name is the baron franz d épinay   133.72530100196252
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating   88.81724311904297
and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever   74.70216910374404
he will never see you again   146.28186893660896
the escape was fixed to take place at seven o clock   43.15769793752847
we had better wait and see what they want   59.69385300774536
said mme   124.84088844568971
this is a council of state d artagnan remarked to porthos   141.52068008492233
it was the point where he had embarked   197.55268300096935
at the door they found the carriage   157.03863920104106
handle the musket and the sword my dear fellow   148.90979693638508
asked aramis   47.58152507460993
bonacieux came in   101.66868074314064
but did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta   21.70928348242971
the poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy   166.4669000944486
and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the garden walks   77.55708925288315
the old executioner of bethune muttered grimaud   82.22527201328823
he hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of athos whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him much   98.86476088191012
i was about to give it when you anticipated me   146.6185101888024
two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth   103.37878843925391
yes yes   168.93302000215556
and now good night   142.02289905193274
i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied   191.34061211715917
nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her   196.67179061952106
what you would now do amounts to treason   156.9034332396272
just so   241.35709134339157
i should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years   205.89587102188432
de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him   50.14934200212609
asked the young man   232.39276109563278
what is the prisoner doing   192.53283101990326
the last   144.64204579492952
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep   154.5198972653199
asked the duke   136.4731663177323
let us attend to what is most pressing   43.73074506597507
but as for me i have been a coward   117.02476813246751
to her and to you   212.9553152227768
some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know   193.01215842931467
ah ha   72.76590586077364
but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you   76.37295247017632
you are very good madame but m   144.457653990585
do you approve of what d artagnan has done   143.07255843195003
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil   147.98855271920758
noirtier   80.38195299076423
come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much   121.37219562507154
you are wounded   87.76321578966758
you would love me then if you were not queen   20.932961887196697
at the lesser gate of the castle   100.99408039930508
thus speaking he fell back exhausted   100.71963718238001
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not move   118.91996448716611
sure enough said the general   212.26135331135583
did you ever remark that   134.3954096569925
i am of a frankness of character quite french   119.95028086860691
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian   206.54126344168222
in what way   9.986698486863915
m   61.26618755454667
but one word more count   273.092872169422
said athos   184.72565471582976
explain yourself   119.64205199264254
wait for me cried he i will soon be back and he set off at a gallop   60.52293866579337
nevertheless said athos in your absence well in my absence haven t i put in my place grimaud and the scotchman   193.20014224560526
because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing   85.21407969066387
said athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him   160.14140678366846
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me   113.50207065395139
danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed   132.6766260492453
but silence   138.96346497705593
your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself   24.564204049631854
the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o clock in the morning   113.98636560086129
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur porthos   134.89417513866763
i thought my body was my own and that i might sell it   202.33089575015887
but to return to the charming musicians you should give us a treat danglars without telling them there is a stranger   119.05433472065253
as for the cellar i have searched every part and poor stuff i found   161.18707924455111
and here he comes by jupiter   99.14483666433412
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him   195.9290014827456
by the saint maur gate   76.62916700257338
oh succor him   125.62786478925265
the place royale be it so   135.32979791379097
bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak side   177.5718653951095
and the steamboat   88.1565626569078
and it is a rather difficult matter   96.05716091866108
these three musketeers shall follow us said he in an undertone   8.895031532680747
at the sight of papers of all sorts titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me   286.5162282714357
listen said m   94.25650822494293
ah monsieur le chevalier said planchet bowing   80.85376579211263
resumed the procurator s wife hesitatingly   40.446977216689035
where is he   152.99446873320824
and you will have nothing to fear on your return   38.598946677917
only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest   213.81604126559813
well he is a man   86.72400611220624
he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged   159.13128665611293
while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels   157.42723192415377
you may   158.08601262050112
asked the sweet silvery voice of mercédès   7.839392944055547
the young man rose and took a step toward her   84.06720665081845
in order to make one s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves it was necessary to be an officer a great noble or a pretty woman   189.53522016759308
i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me   124.32137581080227
it arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saws   154.20702485567622
well well   72.55384194375026
a man   169.72136686193267
that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing   101.93616601707745
that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlini s rear when he fell   151.15889026256767
the third three   207.9247849250341
all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed   117.27729241590269
for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said athos   73.81181647095022
exclaimed a voice   55.10010781597176
he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed   67.32592749601622
measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us   86.94587192742958
go and tell m   181.6332461903857
oh sir said raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my exploits i had forgotten   102.27645779541282
she is what the english call a yacht   138.51263746439938
i told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in such houses as those in houses that had no signs   135.57122014441947
the third an excellent abbé like aramis   179.86991353982302
did the sun shine in my eyes   145.18172883899254
duty before everything   149.97794709131438
1   10.283084363828351
which is not the part of a gentleman   164.1673962890343
he had given his word not to watch mme   166.14580399946772
cried blaisois he is lost   126.6669799667863
i want none   50.31119156657755
live the guards   192.79790830067546
at the royal arms of england you will find a young gentleman named mordaunt   25.040757171997157
m   152.37958536347446
but at this moment two shots were fired   169.1664078209638
true said madame danglars   105.31615530350606
because you shrug your shoulders   143.10817704045425
i only wish to be alone   69.73080505160587
what is the use of one horse for us two   106.4407078423038
no sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him   187.33982626806522
she it is whom you see here   9.649873908508539
otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed   200.70392181670564
have you any one to depend on for assistance   34.40865404126072
there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars   181.97381195141594
and if betrays that hope to death we can aspire   85.06794869210381
my wife s brother is my brother said edmond   97.20716267596555
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos   51.1257025584018
it may be counterfeit said athos   133.70200060959232
all this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of september   43.45874712919749
but the dead can not return their fire   56.81806242249115
you know dear d artagnan i am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman   126.64687776131743
cried la ramee cold sweat upon his brow   64.54066057188618
at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared   83.64904211843071
she belonged body and soul to her handsome soldier   163.98116087359645
felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones   184.6348130932788
has she left armentières   77.50666528848556
do you know them fernand   169.0509691562565
is your love returned   72.87989155038738
having made this well turned speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court   93.75499757233487
the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what o clock it was   202.13101689544396
mounted on an excellent horse which he was to leave at the end of twenty leagues in order to take the post planchet set off at a gallop his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the musketeers but otherwise as light hearted as possible   213.992283329474
when m   108.1310027909052
you can not think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger   243.21835920188988
there go two miscreants   138.7872408795446
come planchet let us pay a visit to the king s treasurer and then set off   180.30584312732444
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition   44.94979792376415
and his immense riches whence does he procure them   165.44230568534624
cried d artagnan i doubt what you say   111.0682059916699
grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the cavalcade   136.9147183056205
and i charmed it away   79.94082571123059
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough   180.90391321702205
asked the governor   138.5772956721304
all this she owes to d artagnan without doubt   142.42645168256968
milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy   82.5149065858967
after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out doctor doctor   126.63152541413011
monsieur the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said   94.5704281362439
said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a third rate fortune   48.240348028829644
i don t know him   18.389714204029318
why should we load ourselves with a useless burden   0.5263849097337214
count you render me sadder than before if it be possible   73.6760998449822
take it such as it is for i have not the time to procure you another   103.32455354180847
yes said dantès   100.33178356473894
and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief   85.1310331767065
nothing   183.31267877283838
she then bowed to m   166.84660371643702
after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word   217.82300748696593
good heaven   114.30110639439641
but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty   69.76834337313603
he motioned to valentine to approach   11.121767894387446
athos arrested   88.33193633838657
is your jailer gone   150.93547470273847
do you regret them   185.66691964794904
present yourself at the wicket of the louvre on the side of the rue de l echelle and ask for germain   136.94119184372082
de tréville i was so confident of your loyalty that i required no other defender before his majesty than yourself   7.060606209983405
peppino turning around shouted a fowl for his excellency   17.036289602161617
and he assumed a look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have envied   165.05190205977428
i have always observed that they bandage people s eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of raoul in the huguenots and really i have nothing to complain of for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the arabian nights   106.06896429992958
besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them with   84.81876614528258
ah   99.61449808131455
then i must wait here or in the neighborhood   235.62585016165622
there is your money half in bank notes the other half in checks payable to bearer   28.986483742661065
he s patronized by bazin   131.45669933157552
why what has happened to you   186.11865583529544
gentlemen said de winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at paris let us separate to avoid suspicion   76.39210054232552
as for patience i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the day   47.26811310541768
reflect then wretched man and repent   174.17586961684765
said athos shrugging his shoulders   288.01631532960914
but no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without speaking   167.5141755233878
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared   55.457864257008026
does he correspond with aramis   171.96500769937475
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one   162.45866022316326
remove the mutton cried comminges   159.35257404965208
the two friends were perfectly stupefied   190.3111858796662
who are you in the first place to ask me to take a turn with you   170.81442405654482
grimaud said athos coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown grimaud i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak   187.71880525518588
in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for 2 000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48 000 francs which you still owe me   67.17325566836176
felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the prisoner   123.25610372483156
and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing   81.36101198942708
a dumb and frozen carcass in fact living painlessly on that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay   103.25280385995814
said la ramee   136.9219588541138
bazin gone the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be sure that nobody could either see or hear him and opening his ragged vest badly held together by a leather strap he began to rip the upper part of his doublet from which he drew a letter   104.59375381018504
said mazarin you are worth your weight in gold   88.21783982211431
oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies   73.12238413399507
maximilian   55.56305471248559
you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are terrible   209.71747126190297
he strictly followed the instructions he had received   63.57103687566169
she is perhaps a prisoner   126.76029775311653
felton was sent away   139.32171511101305
oh yes and with all my heart   172.49993008972055
we will remain in the background said porthos and he will advance alone   56.26250801557262
may i ask what that was   213.73090267489425
i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square   150.8447795462301
such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them   153.69970988334484
have you nothing more to do there   130.50880153678193
and he took his sword and cloak   7.1866725124996975
i go to london   173.02514692914377
a frenchman   127.07764559719142
it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness   149.0267084114875
de villefort   28.71155930657015
they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account   192.11429130668844
guard the prisoners well i beg of you   143.2778096019888
but is he really a prince   82.66348857572308
dost know where porthos is   163.5814712950803
i may as well blow my brains out and all will be over   119.10271683893339
how should i know who they are   245.04765848177186
discipline is the same for them as for everybody else   94.24442377006682
some to witness the sight others to comment upon it   48.45946266650628
if you can my dear d artagnan answer for mademoiselle oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris   125.61581682622187
you talk of sacrilege   112.8188499390075
edmond said the poor mother who tried every means when i call you edmond why do you not call me mercédès   18.76123175639694
exactly   295.58197340591596
have you it   118.07565059022696
a glance threatening and transient as lightning replied to raoul   17.714087905551906
replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest   99.71075448991937
on no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although i during his absence watched in his place   116.24160742065717
that someone has done society a great kindness   19.823382218527712
woman   177.79157010200376
immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck half past four   139.75384456929308
that of a lieutenant of musketeers   145.44778482682295
but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence   109.95383156570783
asked he   221.7732741696148
but your age reassures me   92.59407062795245
well monsieur he is still here   145.32586841432948
he felt the need of making a trip in the ile de france and begged us the comte de la fere and monsieur du vallon to accompany him   152.8239633623859
murmured he i have so earnestly prayed to you that i hoped my prayers had been heard   69.98789551852148
perfectly safe and sound   38.97782734017264
cried the gascon   112.43774305568967
1   101.37584929331499
but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the steeds   139.80244567091424
it was then observable that the substance was greenish   141.87871984812054
oh heavens   89.64282585471943
they are quite new and have not yet been used   80.55098041269927
said he is not that you whom i see yonder   87.59480658291616
wait   133.80294308779733
oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus   103.59929124930585
m   73.80182592180721
then put down three hundred livres said the procurator s wife with a sigh   78.89548693433582
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos   95.86063872868795
a pardon for peppino called rocca priori said the principal friar   176.32299192165988
said d artagnan to porthos   178.48770620131995
and how does he behave towards travellers   218.94692314145294
take away that fool   123.135115923838
but the mourning   155.39931062015944
and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving   110.75389210339752
but i so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me   98.80428948953721
ah is it you dantès   92.18994907992906
his first care was to see what course they were taking   104.74424045173512
yes signified the old man   108.47749434940108
i will await her return and beg her to come up here   203.25753423834377
my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile   154.21794210366357
it must be worth one s while to stoop andrea when that good m   162.22959853818068
i can not inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination   80.31326063559523
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty   162.6072571979935
de saint méran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression   122.17832819797829
impossible   106.82760007883897
stay i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this   70.20774037649676
said morrel sorrowfully   99.66845503630344
i could not seek them to my great regret   101.79049924155993
they are no robbers but assassins   19.37532569987775
morrel   116.51364313186167
tell the comte de la fere to come to me said madame de chevreuse i want to speak to him   130.69906213569845
as he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual   65.97000223094014
monday next   111.59641227964424
dentro la testa replied the same voice with the same menacing accent   30.03340411582154
he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies   73.30220882853497
devil take him   115.00014258431148
he started when he saw renée for he fancied she was again about to plead for dantès   34.963536669179874
on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of enghien   40.72103124182317
this man seems dumb   99.55731462828382
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer s wife he did not forget his friends   154.4249969088084
what is his name   108.60722433833229
said the count simulating total ignorance   186.33062874663847
for i saw the account and copied it down   89.73798281300337
after the siege i shall enter the house of the lazarists   141.58061567899273
at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid   199.6164897083505
d artagnan passed a very bad night   243.66194557259894
didn t you hear fellow   104.69019614352194
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians   122.96252916264909
d artagnan looked and was seized with pleasure   104.72545881766439
demand anything you want and i will hasten to have you furnished with it   142.03524491619757
one day if i allow you to live you will perhaps kill him as you have the others   109.77614380110127
do you know the mediterranean   62.115027211214326
de tréville in the same tone that a party of procureurs commissaries and men of the police very estimable people but very inveterate as it appears against the uniform have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house to lead away through the open street and throw into fort l evêque all upon an order which they have refused to show me one of my or rather your musketeers sire of irreproachable conduct of an almost illustrious reputation and whom your majesty knows favorably monsieur athos   107.34145300779798
you are ambitious it is natural   132.31296206317987
he said nothing almost nothing scratches nothing more   68.52149868797554
i was expecting you   92.2281137811984
he has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle   138.4450653223385
and now you can understand it all can you not   128.0922796479758
the count felt his heart dilate and throb   175.56534432037012
i doubtless wrote   69.44197741028637
stop a moment   156.7318991742547
in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe   13.992796029927348
you are in prison then   159.26950160412437
what else was opera invented for   168.66119743773768
the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honoré itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris   183.03379166191152
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although i place the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est   145.83756388889188
the consequence is that when i saw our laborers which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours i had recourse to a little of my old trade   173.34284917087388
athos was pale and trembled in every limb   123.32951192608347
it is then buckingham   146.9011902231058
long live de beaufort   38.104916633778345
grimaud and i got behind a tree and the scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the road   97.66036640265263
do you find yourself badly lodged sister   145.10792416285835
what did i tell you   191.39962711143335
the villefort family vault chapter 75   242.80881585944314
you say so   57.43286066891118
no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence   16.427411185917123
and yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with mme   18.784261613020163
then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame   187.64272857518068
he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort   124.91922501971948
since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead   8.614447764399827
ah here is a private staircase said the count   28.3909450561556
but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence   81.39186638038896
she ought to have been here a month ago   198.41528895780124
she held in her hand a fresh billet from milady   107.41618355425192
selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered   86.52843993093073
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them   151.41226139530752
m   4.8052988239074494
you know no one but monsieur de tréville   115.33054081743583
asked the officer   134.79717215479198
but when the time came to pay for his rosemary this oil and the wine the only expense the master had incurred as he had preserved a strict abstinence while on the contrary the yellow horse by the account of the hostler at least had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done d artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained   96.81277309381596
he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality   260.8996571727545
he had no fears as to how he should live good seamen are welcome everywhere   50.7660394809665
i have long wished it   200.5650976713326
at the sixth cabaret then as we said d artagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight   164.0006255127206
they get their information on war from warriors   120.18789321451166
friend d artagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future   123.81190232325746
and what name does he now bear   131.73935636329088
the king wishes to get a sleep   187.542620554251
besides there was no tranquillity in paris itself   73.90180392954387

the footman obeyed his orders   154.6585374779319
do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy   119.52471646575043
we discovered yesterday the truth   144.00934326200237
in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment   160.01138084544237
for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo   98.3511520985314
and do you feel sure of succeeding   227.81325720615476
but what a singular fancy this is of yours count you who are the very flower of our nobility to squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the frondists   75.10907917360879
at the queen s last word d artagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery   99.93230291054553
the guide was coming   143.06329591087643
i threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow   183.11927824738333
cried mordaunt come to me   181.49944185988699
but the captain eager to escape from his false position placed between french and english cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birds was in great haste to regain england and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman s caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the french permitted him at one of the ports of brittany either at lorient or brest   244.14689158037388
now it is for me to perform my promise   4.751447285680015
a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in   118.78382380735589
my husband has five or six valises   103.29467612678995
believe me my lord it will be your best plan   189.70571258980175
this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey   188.819341836989
count she said you are i fear gained over to the court   75.83231212429607
danglars was tired and sleepy   149.7209458314096
when i had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a word   246.1083803411667
the queen was in the midst of her women mme   5.774873947272681
on the contrary he came up to me and said it is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not i since he knows everything and i know nothing   85.69465367106196
is my lord pleased with his escort   69.79923357544948
content with making me pay for my hat   169.77646996902433
chapter 99   154.7680865696502
just so   110.4794376808649
oh repeated the young girl almost bewildered can i not leave the house   1.613526043852758
come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife s room nothing is changed here   55.37101178898922
3 1627 it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done   165.97674933646755
albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him   175.67815311432403
and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his   175.1421686646075
her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory   75.34748606284235
some straw they said   161.0039938201765
you will tell monsieur de tréville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him   122.86437158081617
come now what are your conditions   165.35625804834896
i have served them without enthusiasm god knows that i estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteem but on principle   21.23078448729659
what man   150.36933716588857
now said d artagnan for the actual man   153.57668423241842
and as a last memorial he looked round for some valuable object you will add he still sought   175.37868023270832
ah indeed   73.88355631619734
are you one of us monsieur de rochefort   112.55706637527379
my sword   214.88253952113246
cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window   69.03292964645834
so many dreadful things have happened to me lately that i am on the verge of madness   50.92741648834877
said albert   55.42456301166177
the battle of charenton   99.36747674111159
to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels   133.08125357938275
i will listen   165.15123038791998
you may not only hope said danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part   95.50155348675021
mordaunt stopped short   102.31078298443667
placed where he was d artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis   109.26245477319893
said the young man i meet you then at last   226.82090822837395
and how shall i travel then   267.13406892137965
bonacieux shuddering   40.94233762189286
bertuccio raised the lantern and obeyed   49.91691512735254
asked his lordship   120.48338023448042
but tell me well what do you wish to know   214.30287283877325
they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow   29.156659169841674
really impossible   99.78476211374928
then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf pardon me he added with a smile i leave you albert   105.07395616258827
0087m do you indeed think so   108.204522602487
for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty   116.75405081421451
i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majesty s ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor   171.6770700148996
i go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms   67.51973527545914
for the last time will you come   67.9637242306994
he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne   229.22738227527003
yes   52.48726354205971
so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eyes   195.3468105298391
let each take seventy five   48.66275807027547
porthos fancied they were mystifying him and began to curl his mustache and knit his eyebrows   88.66837068307711
how unfortunate that you were masked albert said franz   116.98593166852395
let them hold themselves in readiness to march to night   68.66848184474487
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us   163.46624843623073
morrel said dantès observing the owner s impatience here is your supercargo m   101.53793082175531
why do you doubt it   85.9225689742726
what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end   62.17050564019503
said milady   71.59527834680327
chapter x   100.95619672639293
he then took peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the carriage   170.75674235859796
answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity   133.14682569296377
if i live all would be changed   86.35304242906196
no no   185.04419636495558
a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy   144.42625052942523
the half pistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket   80.02154474280249
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse   140.07553304230476
monsieur du vallon and i are the only two who are armed   102.57813409044456
you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain   16.440616374157955
but the contract   120.99846446224713
arrived at ryston d artagnan assembled his friends   83.6486721665901
the drop of water rochefort had scarcely departed when mme   175.93308795251895
no madame   73.60657278973783
from whom then   163.47081531122004
no   195.54560745039183
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dantès listening ears mingled with brutal laughter   4.689043347745823
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another   169.30442507251976
explained porthos stepping forward   0.2890655384304779
danglars and you caderousse   82.5465392454582
such are for royalty and we are simple commoners   75.22307220318888
singular man   194.19345468883307
say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort   80.57838956210924
you knew the poor lad then   96.71728116405076
said porthos   127.2879692773297
it is so simple   43.40007908158188
de tréville   173.114121313794
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground   178.74562439282735
no   140.12225644770677
well where is he sir   116.1037966920104
therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as i suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in horror   114.64184424128604
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference   87.84570241140608
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession   139.35990740829172
what are you saying   87.05710177672223
farewell said charles farewell my children   185.6014787584511
but at the foot of the stairs d artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane   55.72125082320025
ho   153.75080159506066
thank you sir thank you replied the baroness   71.93278839542984
there are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick walls   133.79044403587056
but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen   117.90331837532362
pardon me for quitting you my dear madame bonacieux said he   101.55759211805884
cried anne to humble myself thus   150.68003388665315
porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience   155.48965227492954
villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity   151.18710612693283
poet as i am i am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti and with monsieur de bois robert who since the death of cardinal richelieu is of all parties or any party   34.58025596993579
she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward   130.4553580942479
bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the first   152.7340148261814
he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel   83.61666930361056
the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dantès mind   73.26738834872981
oh yes   13.3596154494075
prince or not said the man open   138.49826882307647
it is not of him that i am now thinking   75.28251011054274
and you go in an hour time to eat a morsel during which i shall send for a post horse   121.5006440354616
meantime the young woman continued to advance counting the houses and windows   145.48397052021141
monsieur maillard himself   93.92003419740027
no indeed   112.51747877412467
i a protestant   111.64622941538542
what relics are those by which you swear   54.54096994621258
what does all this mean   71.99184515199676
this can t last and he drew another twenty from his pocket   43.37366439290578
at the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bastion   79.86616909216195
yes   113.32925634448183
cried she sinking upon the shoulders of milady   80.97466497171791
brute   177.86508766958477
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan   103.21458172781199
do you wish me to do so   77.13670893076115
have you not heard that some one is coming here   101.61938555700222
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant if the expression may be used   60.256947215517854
no it is not worth while   178.10760667731512
and still she doubted the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death   136.463233529552
it is only fifty thousand francs everything included   15.771107894500147
de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmond s favor   102.67218423131119
d artagnan lowered his   119.85704717048283
and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass   64.41785305756181
make inquiry   68.57934571371348
a hundred thousand francs for a fowl   95.46568972885763
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance   120.19717505366066
now who was that someone   26.21396905176458
cried the host at his wits end   47.99404796406395
he was a brave and an honest man   153.1974486957377
she has neither son money nor friends   166.52245388692688
but he is said to be a furious mazarinist   34.085415573729165
but continued monte cristo you are not in your usual spirits   89.40763708547165
why much the same story   78.48609917932501
if i m not mistaken here s bazin   105.0011905425002
may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out   143.3762664080024
and hostilities with la rochelle had commenced two or three days before about a fort which the duc d angoulême had caused to be constructed near the city   211.67860277338804

the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her   121.6084428575985
i ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore alone   205.00827595820715
i my lord answered the gascon i differ from monsieur d herblay entirely as to the last point though i agree with him on the first   146.59465713803513
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room   106.32654023063341
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states   12.646573032334771
well i can t say i had much choice of going or not going for i was taken to him between two guards   212.9561024716514
i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else   168.96586193026974
why good lord   16.153263192797354
how happy i am   157.1949365989632
a mournful answer awaited each of edmond s eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained   99.69874492429814
he cried the usurper in france   17.072802266484132
i hope you do not doubt it   146.58105854952177
no no   64.57418572344088
and you still bid me hope   167.21183975509277
the prison register chapter 29   78.80209691907085
30229m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator   107.2635633946736
an opportunity will come replied rochefort   63.99162143360234
said d artagnan   165.6667522222654
it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence   169.48716359506892
40100m no   116.74785470699972
passing alongside one of them d artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meung the same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom d artagnan had thought so handsome   158.31462270348166
upon his return to haydée he found her still very pale   76.08812099704235
yes sir replied the abbé   110.19922425051983
by whom   210.35161862938097
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with   178.28329493455396
ah if i knew   67.0406553582839
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queen oh my lord   2.887969129967047
you will be none the worse off physically or morally   22.057394009015184
your name   152.911753629221
he has probably been killed   126.9427896187482
molière had not written his scene in l avare then   82.7567888535651
that monsieur d artagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king   191.955681710722
danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga   73.25818139782636
it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmond s admiration of him   57.55547734881563
hum   55.077463058462456
then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain   169.70449226397875
and that reminds me that i have a revenge to take   80.20584038738662
his highness the prince charged eleven times in person   223.8748271554757
he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm   142.8610805289578
i am sorry for that said d artagnan   188.7977244156846
is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him   4.095684278604239
the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless   139.8126215006016
like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal gift she brought misfortune upon everything she touched   190.34315564148352
asked porthos   96.78415757214168
if this dagger is withdrawn i shall die   227.67376964967332
for the cardinal knows all and it is he who urges on the king who as yet knows nothing but will soon know everything   156.4397405731063
not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his food to him   47.09940721197333
but i will know   79.28924229758545
it contained monte cristo   73.72430681304733
i am a physiognomist i assure you   97.09684837456724
what is it   129.06469637131323
when they entered the port it was already night   6.029444370664791
just so   138.60816899661108
nothing could be better done   39.3706483721391
without doubt   277.14039654259267
monsieur   125.9953783760191
everyone waited anxiously   109.31272935456937
it is   19.838596780274997
d artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable   92.70196534911324
d artagnan resolved to try and enter the louvre   89.04880576441153
laporte entered   13.510710518875896
it is natural enough   38.196545048290844
here are five francs for his trouble   148.46679816300926
take courage   210.46363348973222
madame said he   126.96750949371258
dear excellent friend murmured albert still burning the papers   250.0030994542762
you will charge broussel to report it   120.98981983739753
rascal   71.06527683764455
andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine   37.25886205128499
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a post chaise is an event   137.41432744574456
you will find it in the water you drink from the spring in the fruit you pluck from the tree   100.55457097606373
what friends   173.24205726851616
asked d artagnan   163.9606936686223
at five o clock precisely the count arrived before the house at auteuil followed by ali   86.12133087345059
this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame   28.463306503053772
women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms   92.24647618103675
cocles remained in m   62.57087545027269
here monsieur mazarin is everything   174.46976364163436
perhaps he knows you though you do not know him   138.21042291705814
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance   39.80712153266575
and after this reasoning she slept easily   101.47065188678464
you are going then to offer a prince are you   183.73936327351527
they are three superb animals   60.82426224105488
the following morning they arrived at châlons where the count s steamboat waited for them   95.29480008636432
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist   4.37921891596045
everything with him was multiplication or subtraction   151.38274481044257
but as the prisoner is a woman after all i wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to a woman if not on her account at least on my own   170.069921895164
porthos s plan appears to me to be impracticable said d artagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you   176.084617039145
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each corner the signal agreed upon waved it in the air and the man came up to him   92.51412617140961
remember that i never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived   184.67256901050337
said mercédès passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration   147.6011840318395
i have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics   210.59840354817493
answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture   152.20096424032255
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge   77.19799853872361
i am uneasy about blaisois said athos   129.24136508153018
you had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death   131.48888060243976
the count placed himself between caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat   27.432694380622607
how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of porthos   67.73518485611265
they passed into the next drawing room where tea was prepared   171.7813652174246
what no wine   174.5026474718852
well we will wait a week a month two months if need be and meanwhile your strength will return   88.85581267188346
awaken me   43.72572249232539
wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones stick out   201.1801398587615
said caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it   174.5457650016923
this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one   126.31455908111573

if it were otherwise if he treated me diplomatically that is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupants he would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly   190.20861394932098
he may desire to become my heir and re   94.43136928302829
will you be so good   40.879486901935195
said felton   78.51070073779428
i thought i recognized him and was not mistaken   105.18655149980279
d artagnan shook his head   114.72128175192935
why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other   106.95522299075493
do you not think so   103.32968668708
if one of them comes to my side asked porthos must i kill him   4.331178311972266
that falls out oddly   126.82207009047713
ah   126.66216793928825
when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes   65.51655238087722
when franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon   26.241789031985604
on a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses   197.88876734806044
and as to my other instructions   54.38418466906792
i only repeat what i have been told and like my informant i can do no more   210.85738166627192
the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the tumult   139.07052869093758
d avrigny listen   84.19779599514113
dear friend to an englishman interrupted athos   157.44876590622476
what must i do   54.337428953830646
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead   99.31489603938097
no the order is imperative   81.30657680288252
he is writing she said   84.6893820029386
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused   213.73930393362673
why i have as much money as i want   164.26978408788895
as to that you must leave it to me   227.1708482136665
poverty pshaw   88.99302075954841
cried milady must i name him again   176.33251678809015
it came without the least resistance   109.90459831797642
and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor   161.85348702462568
remember raoul this   186.1108787756895
he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the south had small hands and feet   256.0074939865691
m   75.98767847426211
if not as priest then as son   14.426999453913595
the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god   121.49203286579477
has he assassinated anyone then   31.06715373415338
the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded   53.30564200937161
go then into charenton for i shall begin in a short time there s a signal from the prince   174.15035239183325
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food   35.28506922619948
well then off to the nearest goldsmith s and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him   65.01560376160884
said she to her brother   178.99559583681636
when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends   195.94911293263635
this i ask of you in the name of the interest with which i inspire you in the name of the service you have rendered me and which i never shall forget while i have life   161.1212027709603
he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe   115.98466645645749
but pardon said d artagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man s shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing   34.16543115174839
i would contest nothing   143.79815063730666
albert returned safely then the count was revenged   111.53105499707854
said she you have saved me   43.73826572411613
i passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind i dreaded   115.67242248695989
i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service   278.5011619185655
even his breathing seemed to be arrested   104.14151779251779
valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear   163.72632882394458
look   79.8207440175569
the count of monte cristo the very same in whose house we are   151.08628982033852
i like everyone   159.60673653437638
the count smiled   42.71457434705627
said the old man   53.892748046748736
what of that   155.67689272882728
there is no word though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart that can express my gratitude   113.690025034215
and the guardsman   149.37713210244152
and thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my god   147.43925180433783
unfortunately the general s valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number   143.3122187940479
and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume   169.64715702148797
d épinay that during my life time my father s will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained   75.8680940378368
what are you meddling with   83.59324517715645
it is to be found for the searching   147.30416455671804
in the morning milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended her   120.46950950762745
an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep   85.04083906504553
let me pass   7.922742655764139
my end will be achieved before i grow old   124.33120116529444
if valentine is not now dead she will not die   37.17652366236703
my dear fellow i mistrust women   163.3942313894077
but grandmamma leave me go   112.5296502105923
the fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch to which it had retired to die of old age   137.80997778524008
noirtier   116.39869038963708
he retired to his toilet   32.998726093104224
and with how many fingers does he bless   88.66417196421257
my expedition has given me an appetite   99.15866557483841
has the ministry resigned   34.905257261131965
ah excuse me then said d artagnan   120.05655710249565
there is a providence   164.9832237182441
but your house is not m   76.0282692109081
your wit is always leading you beyond bounds   141.36034416517987
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon   143.67921435008972
ah madame said comminges hastening to d artagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector   23.57770153328167
but to the great astonishment of d artagnan the shutter remained closed   137.95162805704348
i will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he is   75.62785698076304
when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons   191.75562584670126
oh sir in pity send for a physician   77.75826193223322
well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old burgundy   18.704344585355344
d artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he d artagnan and his friend had rendered to the queen s party in the morning   182.2070539998747
then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois tracy besides continued he i have reflected my dear intimate of bois tracy that i am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be   133.487452905486
cried aramis   81.33918306287464
when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil   179.54771694597434
you believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of belial who is called lord de winter   55.77424694397194
yes in life or death   234.26011334633932
the thunder growled in the distance   131.83047907207504
i believe so   158.3819464844181
o reilly   80.25363770861566
but sit down sir i beg of you   85.37641005018574
said the delighted bertuccio and you will find gloves in it   151.50061277050406
the prisoner started and bit his lips   40.293848122056076
in my wife s chamber on the first flight where they are dressing his wounds   143.5706693863488
one terrible idea pressed upon her mind that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again   248.49709123680648
when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery   78.68729584505576
cried my father   170.88847904943162
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach   137.55674468198
extremely   140.97299889940757
strange   83.66132393620833
said the notary   116.0378763132179
the servant bowed and retired   140.32634864892472
and signor pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert when morcerf himself appeared   169.61706365511665
albert went to his room and dressed with unusual care   113.01573324915721
she will come and throw herself between us   152.83366430334604
higher monsieur higher   107.12070734794338
the hands among women particularly to be beautiful must be idle   226.39032084708828
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger   159.33762526147373
monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz announcing his immediate return   21.253785859293316
do i speculate   134.1787998087474
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit   79.87782567479599
at last after crossing the courts of the palais royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate   222.43053732030515
that of the home department or of the observatory   112.096578313441
what for   119.00931374099962
in the meanwhile as the godfather is a second father we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comte de la fère the pleasure or the ennui he may experience   96.5955955178524
it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman   146.16617536319154
yes but yesterday at five o clock in the afternoon thanks to you she escaped   143.2014396317365
two minutes later the thunder of a horse s hoofs was heard upon the road   190.2020300332215
then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance   144.8422176991326
you know he always has wise advice to give   162.0118190495574
a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and aramis   77.99661233495061
ah porthos   84.70514134696539
she will soon pass   108.91571284972406
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket   174.27973817001663
he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter   157.01639196889792
grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm all lyons will hasten to welcome him   158.36575110959487
e   145.58856170058144
this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure   163.79802408132525
the english repulsed foot by foot beaten in all encounters and defeated in the passage of the isle of loie were obliged to re embark leaving on the field of battle two thousand men among whom were five colonels three lieutenant colonels two hundred and fifty captains twenty gentlemen of rank four pieces of cannon and sixty flags which were taken to paris by claude de st   57.36922425621361
and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self preservation   116.44521019521932
there is no compliment in what i say to you then you are attached to me   105.47014272484029
he however arrived without accident in the camp established before la rochelle on the tenth of the month of september of the year 1627   119.44077667125947
sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon   228.18311192578545
you are running your heads into a very silly affair   72.71122242896854
he was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon it   75.29610865792426
each word fell like a dagger on morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy   162.27925363639542
alas anything you please   112.34745791140624
all danger is over   145.5003088479791
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse   133.3300054504095
d avrigny in the same pitiless tone m   273.24838464454604
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur   99.43780720428524
you know to what i allude danglars it is sacred   19.84516923540059
the editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beet sugar probably a composition of his own   154.3031766705164
perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it   100.35817891427273
before god and before men i accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the baron de wardes   21.91234389991132
to day i am engaged in a different affair   99.70020449043534
we render service to god madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous   155.66114506787815
in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart   147.78822459239603
at this moment the young man returned   217.51737650722498
ah let him say now if he does not recognize me   95.92397136967391
are you well fed   112.6082493093019
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened   70.86621143963939
i should be ashamed for anyone to know your baseness   197.41399594849383
villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the letter   79.82514820820145
as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table   208.54762012797465
she has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left   122.74030609584163
d artagnan s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion   99.5847967785519
and he is not robbed   173.2875277598313
f   108.62699806822748
maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them   33.370434994035904
i have studied chemistry because having determined to live in eastern climates i have been desirous of following the example of king mithridates   48.665826986068765
ours egad   146.82320149032466
one individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could   165.0488714694144
and i who have sworn to take him dead or alive i am dishonored and by you   99.08554772882984
an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel   123.75018187280601
ah a month six months a year   273.8221282527792
the jewel is yours my dear athos   136.01990198734055
well don t be alarmed if i return at one two or three o clock in the morning   205.9684159259528
and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said porthos smacking his lips   237.59910317606887
he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in m   106.69220539298546
your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news   128.3808903334263
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind   153.18332750072196
for it is getting late   125.78858843638821
and if you deceive us well it will be the worse for you   144.72533090073057
so are all italians   59.002505829776794
come guitant speak if you please respectfully of these gentlemen said mazarin   82.30429630327863
it is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen   202.0647706275687
cried athos and laughed aloud   96.98433774800509
the events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then i will add them to my list of crimes   150.22635598670286
to remain silent and dignified in his presence   114.17119037361219
a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercédès   26.328705411923522
the journey has given me a devil of an appetite   156.95780607412524
but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage   178.8661105068575
you will take their places and i shall not lose by the exchange   131.03828618023994
henry said charles call me your father   76.41311338189549
why yes replied the count   132.91379934515132
benedetto you are fallen into terrible hands   74.7708953171936
i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france   188.79958223895673
and his name   85.22489496384553
garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors   12.207228634077808
in the cellar monsieur   89.16979330001112
he wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber   112.05660006739292
and the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half pike of the brigadier and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city turned again toward the bastion bearing with them the trophies of their victory   131.13270640261712
in a pate   187.55149170487277
but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands   135.46220157221038
asked the president   43.0565815594002
on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his oath   122.14763047959198
0215m you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place   111.79841136175136
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring   174.69822278562935
surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a death   35.1576164635719
but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself   138.2110983093107
said aramis   135.849567393609
monte cristo waited for the two who remained   39.420980583634275
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which to day we are trying to perform for charles i   162.03938139287243
on your honor   122.29117185981237
sir beware of driving us to despair   69.6811283545527
that is right   84.7637811482797
gondy smiled   112.4392693501498
he knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed aside   89.42336845225269
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy   92.6043197168145
ah   134.75722993385926
and i will say that you are the sextus   140.8131323293559
m   150.3194577507548
louise slid through the half open gate like a snake and bounded lightly forward   122.09553523426204
how so   100.40507534713461
and when   227.9430895875763
in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward d artagnan stood quite astonished   153.1147722390904
the battle of charenton   146.26585126230137
we must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible   236.0094994453259
this man has gone and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance   98.71402272995886
asked grimaud   37.66580269694478
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net   77.13753178290011
why it is a rank of itself in france and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year   52.175202839074345
he acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the englishman paid down on the spot   130.5291351757536
replied raoul   173.4987297228732
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes   62.7406546638521
said the governor   204.86615345354937
stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar   73.2049356165025
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot   142.1574227089676
for you he said   137.80391945431467
fernand became deadly pale   31.17287459904699
mercédès drew near and plucked the fruit   140.48470441963514
confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a deep heavy slumber   17.38490481058909
at these words he gave me a ring   117.20658351675496
albert approached   33.698447511656966
the deliberations had already begun   41.455229073935925
no   85.59055955151078
and you say that dantès has gone to the catalans   185.40304306333815
franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano   70.38253215227249
i do not wish to cause you any remorse   131.11498055199309
at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart   127.66568288301484
caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair   40.960759942490526
tell me now can you deny all this   122.75929357004401
in the antechamber upon long circular benches reposed the elect   162.38040023978337
aramis returned home and athos and d artagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire   74.95132951068437
woman is sacred   39.693785563999924
the poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter   79.72268060067779
cavalcanti will bring without touching the money   210.70711489562387
happily he did not meet anyone   183.98057496114166
parbleu i believe it is not said planchet   195.8183906519281
what a dire misfortune   91.09965602232236
indeed my dear d artagnan i don t know how you manage but you are always full of ideas   81.73087894816439
in the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard is   146.47817194258417
you are welcome monsieur said milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill humor which d artagnan had just remarked   131.55571937111444
his majesty king louis xiii   142.08797148079023
madame coquenard i gave you the preference   254.06641087372776
ah my child my poor child   124.6223949048456
said porthos let us hear what he says   94.06927978320027
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor   203.4386446337358
the count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressing room would be able to defend his property himself   185.857863850228
monsieur le prince   70.69377919227344
the queen was as we have said of great beauty   111.56972124514265
ah   120.5662400840489
and against whom   149.34150097277893
for athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his knee   111.64688847876184
do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count   101.6375917103279
ah   130.41797028643737
excellent   145.88936917748538
the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort who bent his head in modest triumph   12.959660462356652
look at me madame look around me   105.57269455597228
you do not know me yet   92.15643350845434
i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go   61.601153430882746
have you kept him in the cellar all this time   265.1325900676577
he wished once again to press the count s hand but his own was immovable   100.99849969381279
they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer   109.38226305995288
then he determined to go up   37.6990762691388
ah ha ha   184.07229038572078
he   64.00777212927775
i wouldn t give a farthing for his life   95.46718390164368
did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named dantès   24.189317804458852
ah wretch   180.08979696538833
and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination   104.51232829005474
no sir madame de saint remy is at blois with the duchess of orleans   56.15052594636727
it is best to constitute myself at once a prisoner with athos who is already arrested and with d artagnan who most probably will be   135.9554400524246
afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag   181.27100556675313
the host desired himself to serve him   52.70178366027328
said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment   166.9104256100807
yes   162.8149200277046
the fiery spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply   111.91390503876615
i beg you to do so   34.469339345052745
now then to play another master stroke by which i shall gain the heart of both husband and wife delightful   71.46538673248321
i dare not write to his majesty   60.85830257813057
they are prevented at this moment but will join us later   135.4491519669708
good said monte cristo smiling   31.496736335268395
they laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in england   95.89721840175517
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman   101.96838008731747
the bargain was concluded   120.22366694002855
i have not yet seen him   56.37449326370347
demanded milady with a certain terror   178.16797489452233
but this smile soon disappeared and returning to the adventure of meung tell me continued he had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek   247.70631325262937
they could not go to all   149.35678716318859
said the queen you bring us three things which we have not seen for a long time   73.69233517377106
40054m indeed said albert it is exquisite   76.45245150533756
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity   204.3100419492381
listen to me my dear girl said the gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made athos   145.09654127120703
ah   93.28022707146822
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste   5.828485119160078
yes   145.74694435440082
yes for an instant i hoped it was so   167.52004114061515
28   249.91699367474826
d artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon   15.369461383725053
i require honorable guaranties   133.3500714995886
no but i know a little about wounds and mine i know is mortal   38.131741863206855
and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart   163.84847435380772
mute as a carp   186.4425957402833
tell him your name and show him this letter   82.52443310661025
he uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse   22.042440419725892
she cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was captain gaumard giving orders and good old penelon making signals to m   153.17049953529954
milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet   108.1651430056921
break off their acquaintance   144.82424268273357
de blacas has told me and m   47.211981564560844
de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs   175.97581111066137
yes stammered the old man   88.56018994124985
listen said morcerf if mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families i am ready to agree to the arrangement   94.42185297813532
well really nothing is certain in this world   162.3908389975531
in the name of heaven explain yourself   174.91018500346996
i wish to see the governor   48.99966660518626
milady was dressing herself all the time   126.78952354631666
or a tiger   154.88370762794915
cried louise   89.01792640506716
charming   130.3397110806486
as to the yard you may do what you please with it   100.75169769456593
now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person   227.3319544132982
to take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we can not wake up mazarin a little   118.3763317415826
was the gascon determined to keep it as a weapon against milady or else let us be frank did he not reserve the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit   223.2018279452285
the affair in the rue saint jacques   73.45881281282209
30301m meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf who standing before a mantle piece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a looking glass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him   21.006943145473457
you say m   165.18009320488625
he cried   203.52664634899693
he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on l impartial the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor   66.52659358826295
if you wish to see me the king s attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician   240.12855205814577
here is the relic she said   49.41569368380024
it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment   65.37562531464252
yours is a pretty business   36.833800943968384
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spin i feel very keenly fernand that this is charity   140.3852394367646
this is fortunate said the guide   237.26556311931574
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg™ ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support   33.75898331260686
be one or the other but not both replied porthos   113.89072084194181
mme   99.33292929338582
it is your brother who sends this carriage   10.104103999468634
no   107.04011472054222
let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself   95.35910089921043
30   107.95227753164953
don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth   1.6899076951646208
but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness   121.3300689764267
it was the kiosk to which we were going   123.78249314214648
it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it   187.26631277551076
my mother is wishing to go to the sea side what day is fixed for your dinner   174.60051062054134
my dear planchet i am the happiest of men   121.10938986365964
what has he done   206.02503987391594
how do you do   92.95644336185374
the scaffold forms part of the fête   12.229514052365886
a letter   181.5591569137062
fasten it to the poop with a rope   123.9148891653119
you are right welcome   54.20732328451301
it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so cheerful   62.97152588031849
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords   40.95211676415093
one can hide nothing from you answered d artagnan   152.04446935804822
d artagnan remained standing and examined this man   163.05049667703668
well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape tonight   185.08768501097782
because you have the order of charles iii   243.8136480841952
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saint remy   86.33147473143482
as we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the abbé faria s pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading le drapeau blanc   122.65541428697108
and the effect tended to increase the expression of self dependence that characterized her countenance   90.59308568019003
i have asked for no leave of absence   31.716127494815282
it is the nearest frontier   44.036654772706555
asked the cardinal   92.0466685142716
de tréville was surprised to the greatest degree   141.51215288268781
the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first   165.4031877885376
what particulars would your excellency like to hear   25.987854107795343
this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed   97.64013079251943
and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you   171.0134993155251
perhaps there are four said d artagnan   143.8768734596707
the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside her   8.260308100539277
stop   7.026462464213665
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan   217.4125301303189
inquired faria   39.2615710663145
the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn   52.185296977737636
mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of jean goujon like a bas relievo representing an equestrian statue   42.336997781717685
come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her friend   187.8096937929096
you say you fear nothing but death   124.9683148657315
poor aramis   81.57674700895292
that is natural enough   120.38320069980189
oh i can not go without taking leave of her   154.93557756749556
but it can not be   122.70001450823403
now my friends said athos finish them at a blow   161.8499570921396
but know you who he was   80.39351148537477
and then our gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with de wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself   47.75840181955071
albert turned towards haydée   125.13716073705653
at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited   73.47070744880993
d artagnan did not love his son who was his only offspring but m   177.69675148151646
unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him   85.64454401531893
and the other one   118.73913280259421
parliament indeed   140.406379771149
de villefort cried the president do you yield to an hallucination   90.96145377694374
one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility   66.54433373293968
yes yes said he   67.1288072428981
see if he is still in the same place   78.33127706898559
i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his breast   122.48221880042124
at the second he reminded her that he loved her   208.36212382721197
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo   186.72033337145837
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival   124.16327599390732
if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you albert s freedom   157.80963825996378
you are very generous gentlemen of the guards said athos full of rancor for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day   150.83587503372357
ah i recollect replied the count   114.57578433318906
40280m i   147.39004126291445
all s well he cried as he entered   106.66808956565359
that s well said the cardinal   107.41242289880842
after ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten   205.29548783622238
he came from marseilles where he had been deputy procureur   48.999205772280604
grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set off   96.79638021758409
monsieur abbé you are a great moralist   175.81783278955982
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself   103.60416787957524
two broke from the heat of the fire   87.64325498293637
do you wish these proofs these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed   112.58568136247335
excuse me abbé said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very much   10.649854295239564
albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up   201.98026484420552
do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening   60.334689447890895
then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the king s blood   219.35401499287138
let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are right it will be you who have discovered the true treasure   171.95953662002245
bonacieux   142.3313198853674
chapter xlvi   226.30082153748793
i hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence i shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that i have been able to prove them to you whilst i had the happiness of living with you   193.68064364444558
i will not abandon buckingham thus   131.1773966234369
you are the king s servant and must go wherever that service calls you   25.696462029735017
caderousse shrugged his shoulders   78.10093621727987
the window yielded   32.69325250634108
the silence however could not last forever   132.64514298000816
think of my mother   122.75758070703458
it is this answered athos with a trembling voice   120.91306731372335
he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos   127.18334827811132
by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level   113.783234238236
what have they done to you   65.39617503628048

then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbé s chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed   147.65163568447326
in these books your honor tis told how hungry voyagers drifting out to sea have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with the fattest among them   132.74982956934406

yes   36.732806735256986
parry said the king rising too my horse   52.78822963182574
said mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for porthos s devotion without opening his purse   122.96020930046507
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow   103.13012312413271
porthos put his back into the sheath   82.29653251155699
commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work   48.63022328549633
just as he turned a hand rested on his shoulder and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed good evening maximilian   89.23442393003157
deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards named comminges made his appearance with his clothes all torn his face streaming with blood   73.47092377077118
and i own that if you have no stronger proof to give me i have another replied maximilian   154.08579156599507
she has near her a certain laporte   88.76040053214382
d artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast   113.75973214444431
i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops   207.69274852405795
my lord i think we are in bad company   85.48701514088533
de tréville being informed of this by his eminence packed his portmanteau   65.0633539919865
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men   98.651512338173
had she one redeeming trait   98.39750590876149
really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said monte cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction   59.84265161797435
but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at   108.21298875528912
the fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played   142.35946184296014
the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an instant   174.49808970464645
i wish to thank them all at once   79.6789176132279
i will tell you all replied anne   138.69366473017573
good heaven   199.5037205151113
you hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the cause   175.55084022730142
before our letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon   145.04290696723115
she looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy   198.013587596055
franz d épinay a delightful travelling companion with whom i made the tour of italy   200.5613413004603
m   12.326850064484702
o reilly   19.614176666652085
oh   63.75209125807863
asked debray   122.04877683859598
but what is the matter   209.7272942348641
30197m calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling   168.94218822974702
three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not heartfelt   113.2417325577964
come monsieur bazin make yourself easy said d artagnan   17.677081399689996
yes to make him come to paris   4.167905697206223
what is that   98.27983760224875
here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel   100.17213502427057
there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that porthos was not at bracieux   25.07895324633671
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said d artagnan shaking his head   101.00090540433521
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp   146.88626025482068
the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note case containing his letter of credit for 5 050 000 francs   152.20109986952673
but i must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred livres   236.56849559634756
m   106.0830101055745
the gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel   126.75386314220623
his opponent stirred not one inch   45.32367627177487
a torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge   178.6422016220386
horrible   67.28182412099127
the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the defence   258.97522872629565
here then is a puzzle for the learned observed d artagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise   195.3324199450876
and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets   116.30119116382748
suddenly he heard a cry it was his daughter s voice   131.21653528054875
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore   159.76849179784895
the worthy shipowner knew from penelon s recital of the captain s brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him   76.43497587148664
oh   132.87205023739043
cried d artagnan   53.795061806585124
it seems said d artagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries   92.7891836478501
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos   122.41253772332945
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet   154.48345637864188
oh   108.65597420723331
stay sir said anne to him   65.53135239113583
thank you my dear beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice   69.06629522372441
monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect   75.37203519756662
monte cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name   132.9201504658658
but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in   148.15941525721433
amen   173.89557067442243
this man had been four years longer than himself in prison   170.52116181148585
but i thoroughly hate but a few   166.02827012473753
it is the only means of rendering italy strong happy and independent   79.97405915858593
said albert whose brow reddened   163.27797895990855
yes   34.56721391900116
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope   122.10536018059254
come four   274.26666955604725
to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible   121.78065388459747
leaving the church a woman and a young girl dressed in black the one as a widow and the other as an orphan have re entered their cell   147.18491463259795
at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her   124.83217722930084
but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have none   126.14961830775921
the pates were excellent the wine delicious   165.92393020916307
how can i   43.12631528098065
he told me your life was his and i have promised him that you shall live   5.47211293818475
19 god has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment   15.528809045053237
cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly   119.36657018594474
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her   226.21275900816192
asked d artagnan   125.0853204918442
to your eminence   97.99717721903917
i think not monsieur unless something new should happen   130.55393350070278
the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door   165.76908846185395
m   112.88937715568805
valentine we may easily conceive where morrel s appointment was   83.53513321371861
this anxiety became so great that it even extended to aramis and porthos   83.70142412550534
look again chevalier returned lord winter   128.97694109134335
the box taken by albert was in the first circle   150.58922628320815
you will not find one better carved between albano and civita castellana   124.60896411698536
they are   140.2297526756077
it was true and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning   110.18978895509608
he knows all   150.9747419244306
in eight days the campaign would open and he would be compelled to leave paris   169.86376039405076
they have abducted her   28.21083476667981
i   139.10376702179758
and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper   131.7284299261259
monte cristo motioned him to be silent   101.71448854610748
that day the minister s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill humor   175.13277670768957
then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl s heart   171.03637279494214
1   127.00240095763023
d artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume   242.93284409261003
why did you not have yourself conveyed to paris   108.80884625329335
what was most pressing was to get mme   181.32326805005874
i was within two paces of you monsieur replied the procurator s wife   78.88780562812435
because i scarcely know why but it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it   53.83285989962436
he thought the carriage was about to stop there   141.72970952332403
noirtier de villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of m   122.67993746978969
listen to me mother and do not yield too much to agitation   29.46543976199817
and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o clock   125.69508531571341
you will need it this evening perhaps   37.250612020248894
i am an ungrateful fellow   68.17315168838132
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect   159.11619433585184
but rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years   89.10729385052564
or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed   121.02414502366548
what was it that you thought   66.3013470566847
he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover porthos with ridicule   205.7130206933211
parbleu   153.33847618967437
they advanced towards a boat which a custom house officer held by a chain near the quay   169.6913428631352
i think him capable of everything   6.072769586150599
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv   185.39524664354363
his majesty in full dress was accompanied by his royal highness m   148.42510619192973
in the meantime d artagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette   118.24582154015384
exclaimed d artagnan with a look of astonishment what danger   176.37334023266385
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo   89.41003755986452
a man of talent and merit whom you will like as i and monsieur de chavigny do i am sure   43.62416521012159
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin   149.52455729183313
i think i shall send him to paris   12.740607583617049
if it were as you pretend it is said he i should be forced my dear aramis to reclaim it myself   69.96101595906677
planchet and bazin came last   228.02282979487472
then she ventured to ask what had become of felton   116.10503301488538
did you see the postscript   139.74518973827722
a voice of strange sweetness   72.83678438677796
they fire like grooms said porthos   141.83753245237642
for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week   135.51989124448667
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin   99.07592411567518
villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement   64.61129410548028
40306m volume five 50009m 50011m 50019m chapter 96   128.0315759560249

copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change   104.38352930428157
true enough   168.816319099281
the friends obeyed   55.47817463083897
well bazin said d artagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more   153.4081748146101
the island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away   33.89900698216486
queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy mission   177.92383240681343
you love me madame   70.0490956985131
monsieur mouston said d artagnan i should indeed condole with you had i not at this moment something very pressing to attend to   69.77104595231177
yes but not against a strong dose   75.58312384661045
why did you not tell me so before   39.86062020658743
why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from mazarin   5.2752941891641
muttered d artagnan   259.49018299951024
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner   141.01486912154422
yes i understand perfectly said d artagnan   177.4479801888152
no   165.07911563219827
she only told me she wished to send me to london to serve the interests of an illustrious personage   82.0518096045542
your pardon replied danglars i merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time   207.65212080759298
let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble   165.48392928886804
good said monte cristo to morrel who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which danglars had been the victim i have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand francs for which i would have paid a hundred thousand   182.5894073493826
nobody knows him   193.4596919422287
he was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal   157.57837537220522
my father and the baron d épinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending said villefort   159.7510528225465
your servants to whom i gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the inn   192.11020501842313
men fell around him as they had fallen at rocroy or at lerida   172.90556926918654
that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us   240.40046212948977
i guessed it   28.92068375945388
there is not one of those women egyptian turkish or greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy a doctor and in psychology to amaze a confessor   64.11836065006861
isn t it so kitty   76.93536176462044
i have won five pistoles of aramis   163.5305376644165
his eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to come   114.13833915648117
speak not of crowns   124.84695113326447
follow me said morrel   83.06596648749687
that is true   186.72787230024971
thought the gascon   138.8630772482839
that is my name said athos quietly   47.334353225186916
i am commissioned to find out my companions and i began by you who were the very soul of our society   206.69385582737488
how so   75.90356611890783
the valet de chambre announced m   98.48178116409244
or from your generosity my friend   43.35405515409532
an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never   38.44848398424615
cried villefort   8.23218950934799
true but that makes no difference   99.73940479966532
the château d if   85.1737406057177
well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boy slayer   104.41226926466288
and what is your opinion   155.08158285773746
then i heard the well known creaking of the door although i had heard that door open but twice   65.14226271512723
ah for the sake of our child let me live   124.52870941213797
de blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister   132.76206302110765
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man   229.59083630419616
said the musketeers   108.78589311572402
no not at all   200.49515021467832
beauchamp for instance   150.4493772504024
while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy   134.29290981565168
i shall very soon learn that language by signs valentine and i promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us   282.57932436425193
asked planchet   91.60236374259682
i received this morning five millions which i paid away   122.15349985444435
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate   161.90564135378318
you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are   121.61548583825308
asked the young man   99.02397194820935
you do not deny it   60.090267104668825
did he receive you ungraciously my dear friend   107.08492308345228
ah here is my mother cried the viscount   178.7020910707473
i will depart   144.634891955637
ah i always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter   157.1670295103061
are they both dead   222.50082926095382
another queen in want of help   54.65636598851066
yes who was hanged   44.14017024374954
good heavens   166.22176525500703
yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not   42.29347075611295
there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin   32.405262039459615
he s a gascon   82.5782224754599
but to return to what you were saying beauchamp   64.92453701130717
are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess   113.9765428929365
my lord cried the queen you forget that i have never said that i love you   146.34332221532586

gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach   83.87319883384265

mazarin came within three steps of d artagnan and pushed a spring in the wall   136.14331208459166
still it is better than suffering   55.48857679117376
i warn you master caderousse that you are mistaken   191.62987487494874

from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino   92.79284065154025
at any rate it is a french word   105.48546662794223

at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions   146.95600208027366

said debray advancing towards the back staircase   116.20072308032248
the abbé started   90.34455865946333

he said you   133.20585629060452
monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation   132.9900841691538
and you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his fee   169.31523114799361
exactly so   176.30055611888082

he took her for the queen   63.53083350396551
one would say you were carrying me off   50.127705478884295
said mousqueton   174.09043651126424
the rest concerns another person   220.73812398768524
tis true that our position is an awkward one   74.72029746006267
the commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness   210.68069565634295
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse d artagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st   167.77005071039918
but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty   130.13561704769003
but now all is lost   186.84433465590737
well in my turn i advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear monsieur groslow for i can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it   37.49333638800357
and that is injurious to you among the women   74.07528977683936
oh if so punish me as you will   41.32462196507227
and have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result   141.0001890924558
and if you move i will blow your brains out   144.15397569371697
i leave you therefore as i took you rich but little respected   130.7183210341488
i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard   163.40035076594643
in short at the moment in which she has just obtained from richelieu a carte blanche by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is d artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy botany bay some infamous tyburn of the indian ocean   112.77186912470728
listen   94.89053748194686
indeed   148.46268483844267
very well   61.23267072802819
of that great that sublime sovereign all which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son in law sir   126.49098713500547
you think so   144.77270248938854
soon the two gentlemen stopped also   60.77992397759296
it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love   11.369349716613442
at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank   175.2934278553674
are you going   235.69550864228586
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st   14.432110342046471
and see perhaps it is a happiness for you humble and powerless as i am that you have met with me for if i leave this place well i have powerful friends who after having exerted themselves on my account may also exert themselves for you   145.95983863490062
i mean that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune   125.7879362810796
some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister   151.0869029095366
she broke the silence   91.28129238372888
and wherefore   187.61299608924884
weak or strong repeated milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul   97.94926378095359
that is well   57.80187272259962
asked aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished   60.24365122936693
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step   166.14107068048634
when do you mean to set out   132.8213797874147
chapter xxiii   87.36913784694923
no monsieur and yet i recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then   106.70578229525783
your majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between monsieur de la trémouille and myself   143.97024835211292
julie threw herself into his arms   99.06940710616985
poor creatures   75.61845946854655
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear moistened eyes raised to heaven   5.176061157885286
ideas and men appeared the same to him said albert   159.91568384094302
i shall be gone only a few moments   152.1717322717106
in saying these words d artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved   171.5201201749016
but i was obliged to pay a hundred that will do that will do monsieur bertuccio   136.09507869515684
have you not let it go out of your hands   80.75856876603233
said felton i doubted but now i believe   79.48143533482659
40194m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered   77.79966881124268
oh yes   181.39940715448256
at this very moment mazarin entered   4.911749972368952
you have forgotten it porthos   186.04486749448944
they are robbers perhaps he muttered   67.4283338799907
this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau   73.74597013862558
ah my dear monsieur bonacieux you are generous in this matter   246.00518372902698
i will do my best   104.97701744684622
silence   59.90187567336292
but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked   78.08128458100808
ah it is jacopo she said the captain of the yacht   78.2821612633077
i do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to paris and the parisians will defend us   179.16292568516678
you were asking then   70.47463512362208
this time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined mordaunt   121.24604178323368
ah said andrea deeply affected   14.494107155537534
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him   235.91948456399322
tomorrow morning if you like with the greatest pleasure   181.6482390697946
think what a solemn engagement you are making   99.85472995365447
then i shall really have them   106.61910918550983
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down   103.29916235349909
when m   78.85091349049114
scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him   166.40345375157116
no one has ever dared to give me any   145.3606424341064
my father and m   182.39699377788475
i can not answer for the queen   224.13270625741157
one night more and he would be on his way   89.4327076374872
a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird   158.88256483458548
an excuse for us   46.18915279624319
his servant   224.25915332853745
i have asked the headsman of bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief   74.41473992094672
yes said he i made a vow to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger   38.704013506780385
it was that paper you read this morning   112.06515680405654
speak i am ready to obey   64.09473003554989
what tenderness my sister   82.38564136039574
yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy   77.04170873006798
but felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said a pressing message from lord de winter   125.51295346302973
from this phrase d artagnan awakened planchet the reader must not suppose it was night or that day was hardly come   67.62784672183166
are you satisfied sir   173.8928366882445
tell them said morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that i am her betrothed   126.41213164902405
have we overtaken them   227.9576530662315
pardon my frankness dear friend   147.80979728136754
do you know monsieur d artagnan   170.5363753203611
i have but one question to ask you what do you intend to do   27.74381449048967
cried the steward here   104.80731774325848
not a word of what has passed   44.85891605491008
you will give them to your son who will of course take great care of them   67.72015615908336
what happened during the night   104.5922509637887
you must still deliver it said athos   47.27935683342115
for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them   84.27906614576688
inquired valentine uneasily   5.757294697280699
yes   137.8558772659785
on the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their stuart they shall see him   216.52394000141743
no indeed replied madame de villefort   85.13770972186683
art thou a messenger from god   121.54855951323938
a conjugal scene chapter 66   85.74419160643524
said athos are you still afraid   117.82052514443272
on seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully   148.20425949338676
and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration   126.45163819002029
morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening   61.70742779501284
and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows   167.6121072647556
athos stopped   198.66099038168835
when you arrived madame de saint méran had already been panting for breath some minutes   215.94230773334698
the lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table   243.0743248319451
but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber   143.24626578473817
i have become simple in my tastes and am without passion i hope   111.89044994011358
thomson french via dei banchi rome   108.92779773509652
said porthos   71.47232082440168
if you let him go i am a dead man   173.95107783060598
de villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house of m   67.12674279561993
go and fetch it my good fellow   210.80089145877628
and how many men had he with him   204.8481092808188
said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before mercédès herself   26.685453006757285
monsieur said athos placing his hand on d artagnan s shoulder monsieur is the chevalier d artagnan of whom you have often heard me speak raoul   79.88131061170992
said albert entering   6.792876249712833
in a moment that part of the floor on which dantès was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way   199.67604915710754
in the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each other s arms   144.1788853091894
all all all are thine my adored mistress   103.19692963666749
de tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor béarnese   56.62443723944024
bazin beadle at notre dame   126.40017068732229
my lord they shall be yours   186.44204790923573
upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone   26.59220104864832
d artagnan s penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost   85.42329033779367
the fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy   68.38242861259934
a burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain   185.69685481806337
andrea   51.839191305386805
i do nothing without her commands pray understand that   106.88593940333375
the count s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man   124.21807108301513
it is then a service which you propose to render us count   160.2450678433031
not only him but some of his friends messieurs porthos and aramis   79.51165801797791
i begin and without any rhetoric   222.37753293617152

said she hesitatingly   115.81616738413155
an hour afterwards they returned   86.96067378642886
what   213.32211521265705
planchet whom he had sent home two hours before from the hôtel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him   103.02345319833782

better   171.60965733330522
that was to follow her   95.58419713494838
at last when pistache was sufficiently well trained monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment   223.60595158332296
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn   11.534743596227486
nothing would be more easy said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal   187.34074212634602
what do you mean sir   82.42832809105631
i know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his   134.67523083834303
the child accepted joyfully   177.5575000508138
ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know   59.708290475730614
by the baron himself   115.11401446209692
well i will remain with you   173.56031184383303
here it is   164.22843442147308
one believes readily what he wishes to believe   103.77952143043865
replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civil   135.49173341618626
said he   112.78482775158155
he then entered the room   146.52248848676197
the queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen and among them the duc de chatillon the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of madame de longueville on the place royale   103.29676150319457
d artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning fever   133.30160929062947
facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexceptionable   113.73113236306105
do you know of what he died   160.1650086613544
the abbé rose took his hat and gloves   63.24974189463963
hold just above that tree is the little spot where i thought i was killed   97.925289566087
cried milady struggling   120.84257365134998
that s it said the tutor   185.11026155600115
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crown piece in the dust   201.2960006250068
pardieu   134.8977890441418
god is wearied   17.100049811916506

repeated anne   157.06864222624566
i shall have nothing to fear but robbers   55.834514709013256
the way you came   151.97812474922517
i had an affianced husband a man whom i loved and who loved me a heart like yours felton a man like you   112.80459449064779
but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation   186.7855206229655
what a beautiful creature   85.91597254356776
replied caderousse   15.018314299481688
and morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase   109.7072359017595
speak if you please said mazarin   141.52643860774506
now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities   164.64919735817872
a paper may be lost   169.46395860098144
it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him   190.82184285027645
you can not make me believe that   138.7284230220523
said he   175.3234674062486
chapter 5   128.06365595513688
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed the young man is right   164.00131915118033
my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible   71.08430715497296
comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery   61.2910620704107
hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m   223.65655379505256
cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon   67.17786140951927
these arrangements made the lackeys retired   136.22638958959743
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here   119.94511069064097
then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures   17.56064789776407
we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838   141.96459831645257
and can not women be dishonored by appearances   242.9567736163616
i understand replied porthos   155.10589181078984
your excellency has not stated the number of guests   81.86770235730035
well i hoped to get an exchange of arms to substitute the sword for the pistol   122.33078193263086
laporte assured himself by having it twice repeated of the accurate address and set off at a run   38.95936047362039
when this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women alone   211.5387788592399
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg™ works   62.96650126957346
yes indeed   121.2243648518816
oblige me by taking a seat said d artagnan pushing a chair toward mordaunt who sat down pale but calm   115.87403453646904
haydée haydée you are young and beautiful   69.12548355334582
he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home   139.32120474763755
monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets   93.18611201957572
and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is about   159.16712644690364
no   57.41954440428053
honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door   121.08614943132618
now look here i want something to eat   70.55541688271951
give it to me   225.12277352141749
the pardon the next day danglars was again hungry   146.78415579438044
when i no longer require them bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale   139.3604257966824
he was we repeat handsome young and bold   182.51693690670652
the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man   119.6592286798623
come do you really think you have anything to say against me   215.4744949240328
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears   84.4874371511244
m   72.73625546871463
my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy   225.8418075779589
what does this mean   273.34904497530334
you wished to double it and how   175.64425760062983
debray has just seen you at my house   38.72923645119765
it was one of those events which decide the life of a man   173.50780685825458
on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saint méran and villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor renée valentine s mother   28.124879056293253
pardieu   133.59129567079543
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment a conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation   169.45938896334098
i will do my best   168.82761876576657
everything shall be done as you say athos   75.24832758214883
i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet   164.1661193662725
besides my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes continued la ramee and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort   164.25651368328784
séguier keeper of the seals looks more than once for the bell chapter xvii   183.95772227223358

i invite you with good will   97.01585139126526
as the carriage stopped at the door and albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a letter   80.10673192983205
and while the three musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him   138.8113235122952
always to wait till the end of the month   8.808330773312377
as dantès his eyes turned in the direction of the château d if uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey   134.0030452430392
at the outer door the steward paused   148.26130355518944
your mother has no longer either throne or husband   51.030392292781684
it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the jardin des plantes to la râpée   59.45191243470406

i tell you that you were wrong   124.56702947920334
this instant sir this instant i beseech you   118.26548003786546
and having first married his banker s daughter who left him a widower he has married a second time a widow a madame de nargonne daughter of m   112.6354207374335
life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread   29.36697039087686
and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him   180.32330646186136
no father stammered villefort   180.47845547064466
they parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest he looking after her with eyes of love   4.903922300981691
our friends   156.9018000233273
the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house   54.1708537391016
but on that indeed he was intractable   147.9476879050402
oh i know this country marvelously   137.98972803999925
well i shall see him to morrow and tell him about you   127.12700416683505
is it not worth 300 000 francs to save our father s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure   120.28536279445011
oliver cromwell   27.166102913491088
he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary   173.1856299243333
oh leave me sir   189.58809540728544
d artagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side   157.41477636663234
you are sure of it   143.69139501572812
noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the chair   63.27967555203049
said monte cristo   60.58651045242609
the troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings   147.963891369058
and you will pay ready money   122.62236083557917
nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry   137.68027171320082
ah it is you my lord   213.54841108035157
not at all   76.62135642850399
he weighed the two angers in his brain that of the cardinal and that of the queen   97.6663705954043
so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day i beg of you   61.79418121102489
it must have lost its ferocity in the second generation   140.40628656488784
in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30 000 francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person   190.51536226869786
tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct   66.65484098980187
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels   107.7427724304125
he criticised everybody humorously   97.49191711318618
chapter v   162.2353771620356
do you remember aramis that it was here he received that famous bullet wound   134.59283432967607
i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces   78.3508846022435
drink and relate then   117.8103982146436
i was taken to the slave market and was purchased by a rich armenian   78.00261241303451
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content   92.2679008634177
she will soon get over these things   109.63790622065082
how many rounds do they make a night   184.31021637423484
i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron   51.972177382128564
i will enter a cloister   182.99235614777774
i am no relation of yours   178.38872696922596
but they may come any moment for you left word that i awaited them   183.59140599384511
i hold this serpent in my hands   121.47206983211858
you know wine is a deceiver   1.3172923085446087
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents   179.60258081718135
yes it is i   84.83304901974064
you do not know these men monsieur comminges but i know them first personally also by hearsay   204.0540555089745
j   55.02048024483746
athos is right you have my adoration said aramis in his turn pressing his hand   20.249068123731064
he glanced mechanically towards the piazza the scene was wholly changed   68.82227512868211
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar   211.96220183332176
exclaimed the commissary   154.24923398742123
i can not be mistaken   89.39679203789238
the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door   48.287802777306496
and when can i see this young lady for whom i already feel so great a sympathy   64.56813026964213
mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help said d avrigny since she is dead   81.5171662533654
then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him   78.27971447346727
immediately the aldermen clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants each holding a flambeau in his hand went to attend upon the king whom they met on the steps where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcome a compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late laying the blame upon the cardinal who had detained him till eleven o clock talking of affairs of state   132.76607508650042
yes you are right   160.38514856052078
no i spoke of the duchess de chevreuse   95.76616768005474
d artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with lord de winter and then returned to milady   164.4508996238236
athos on quitting aramis went to madame de chevreuse   49.70928535157071
de tréville s as nine o clock had just struck and as planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task a knocking was heard at the street door   126.21077335997947
i hope we shall have something better to do to night than to draw the sword   130.51391979276036
we shall take the place of those two fellows   113.72286693006208
a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital   24.185656293271748
have you seen the king   37.369178907244674
is it possible that god has abandoned his representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably   38.035654978732566
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her   193.52653315592582
how beautiful it must be   88.5128567193005
who married the marquis of saint méran s daughter   199.49804642229873
we have already wasted too much   85.50345727374838
all at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me start   92.63948680581963
tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first   251.41982977387013
may the devil take me if the child be not dead said porthos   128.99267570886357
said franz calculating the chances of peril   177.55046312821995
valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers   73.95133225214832
an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me   95.10555639866413
you ask me why i have requested this interview   193.63858072988077
the prince assigned to every one his post   57.74152533341238
you have rightly guessed madame replied the count   107.7995257427832
and she stepped back to retire   172.3059046582489
they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention   168.39461202064933
oh of the most unfortunate kind monsieur   71.3427825538183
let us examine the enemy s army   53.653439155790146
but cried bonacieux this is not monsieur d artagnan whom you show me   135.05478717516277
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence   95.3885777993929
what matters it to you kitty   72.34271951312613
always cautious planchet   160.7990502385621
there they are   194.59393793127745
d artagnan and the englishman d artagnan followed milady without being perceived by her   76.32450398653185
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing   109.51186732353155
de blacas taking his hand restrained him   59.936586503447664
it seems his former master accustomed him to that   43.26051124683272
his voice was stifled by sobs   105.63693594087404
in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron   81.02110894726849
the magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles   101.74512225360195
i do not reproach you athos for what you have done   108.72336997166597
a retired baker   135.1448244929772
days and weeks passed away then months dantès still waited   126.47234319926699
porthos did the same   106.21984613511664
a regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it   149.68563790237687
duke said flamarens you forget that to morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the queen   166.02361457090302
chapter xxii   35.54667576414924
as to the sailors of the pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared   170.66556049792956
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair   184.81588273384483
what is there we can do for you   76.40936281963963
i reasoned thus money time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family   36.21643826437665
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault château renaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees   33.08002446569252
into the service the king s service   168.8482548676413
stop said d artagnan   76.3181027944258
cocles went first and the stranger followed him   146.29586624460362
still my three brave fellows   163.51407725022642
but shutters   125.00712403753286
chapter 82   51.91213385305045
and who were the others   100.05343336412173
oil is a sovereign balm for wounds   102.17820566305132
she suspected what the letter contained   127.17414895472432
madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard   111.7495848094868
i hope these gentlemen have theirs   178.2193217020601
yes and you would be gratified if cardinal mazarin should make you captain   134.41718233795922
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner   27.175574724308817
he will be one as he says cried porthos   157.16584795203855
i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5 000 francs   77.06386551634787
i can not take you however to the siege of la rochelle said d artagnan   123.34417097198258
ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know nothing   74.46107503927276
indeed sir said he to albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the case to the king s attorney   153.7212942632503
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty   138.74418243625684
only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the musketeers   138.33105750355224
the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerf s are you not   54.93278169200984
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling   158.16270757273344
bad replied athos very bad   78.18041665851887
because i should never get a better   89.73570517335797
in conscience i can not kill him   68.783950745069
as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters   126.21806250684968
was that it   225.74763750111885
the minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to madame beauvais it is time for the king to go to bed   209.0926238883627
it is this listen in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry   69.2285667661038
and those two equally fine thrusts at bernajoux   84.47718278113027
i know it monsieur   225.07317160535246
it is now three years madame since i saw you for the first time and during those three years i have loved you thus   29.53542195780311
he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris   178.59642691667412
what is it   38.9333769590981
i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole   106.8256136895574
she will escape us replied the young man   190.03304279393342
he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope   230.0701658836342
franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper   78.48952788630932
and he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle   35.579099736433434
who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension   167.88196594741936
you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance   61.57641093593837
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened   187.88901675099075
at length the light disappeared   239.37180902533225
beware   107.18619316587285
yes it is so long ago answered porthos   37.37017158010835
wasn t i right to part with the horses   129.70872063082564
does grimaud know him then   155.19544606555212
the circumstances that had hastened the return of d artagnan to paris were as follows one evening when mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices   120.58655264225621
and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers   95.29593461635285
oh you are no stranger at least not by name replied madame danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you   139.3836707890374
he had passed the night standing and without sleep   12.52624759435517
our bark flew before the wind   97.92919158378312
shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout   65.16685697837774
we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke   118.90199416210989
madame de villefort raised her arms to heaven and convulsively struck one hand against the other   130.56160365361004
murmured milady in extreme terror   73.61236709863792
why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment   94.5448204819957
said milady i believe so   63.995363812559546
a lutheran   70.56489944368809
no my lord   190.90447824729108
well   196.84925734462468
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him   42.766321273329055
you see   132.63977553855239
particularly as i have business in that quarter   25.00169752870073
and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love   193.40149226874502
but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven o clock of the morning in the month of january   38.59820390328926
as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentine s room to m   327.542998991395
you make the demand badly replied aramis   159.39605077553367
remember that was the only means   32.06891403713212
but whether it be for recompense or punishment i accept my fate   102.78927097290389
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor   193.57635039681867
all this will not advance your outfit said athos   42.35671298300335
then turning around and seeing that morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuel s hand significantly watch over him   83.67761355943202
every one withdrew   105.7435656670727
only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other   104.8694789527274
to the sloop said felton and row quickly   139.21881995440444
that is impossible replied the governor   146.5649121711309
just so   43.06993595927344
both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse   207.9875026164719
two or three thousand   76.59481472827473
ah indeed   202.3605979937534
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault   109.65773779707919
and you have seen her   67.84427939021916
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor   197.01160847559277
i felt sure it must be you   140.47034389903783
said mazarin i have been proving it to you this last hour   121.76706038001736
replied tréville haughtily   40.926767835499504
why people jest with death   75.56396079364247
remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs   149.91576164064008
and with a firm step morrel went up to his study while maximilian followed him trembling as he went   111.00299017040082
the abbé busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone   80.25288456438867
yes   62.70475190824197
once in paris i shall prosecute my search for that unfortunate woman   50.47053441122016
does your eminence doubt my word   54.47683341671966
i think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever i go they will follow me   61.64373976392826
come said beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend   113.024488896623
indeed the name of bernajoux was known to all the world d artagnan alone excepted perhaps   161.01073475177915
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over   62.21029315185216
it was a friend who spoke thus   83.70161002637326
and you   128.43544854230885
and danglars wrote the address as he spoke   178.77758876316616
the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled and affixed his seal   102.43224973645232
i suppose answered d artagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much   161.00388137539872
he took you for buckingham   75.0151352330486
no sire but to buy your majesty   91.53784529582958
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale   114.98747921920751
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges   187.3618229281915
morrel caught his hand   115.22477232756657
enough viscount   156.62269607678567
we will share said porthos   92.80271513944132
aramis called bazin and after having ordered him to join them at athos s residence said let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin   172.24151765470094
why so   92.70518112291757
de villefort   96.85582147347637
s   143.59555097880013
she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties   88.71948411662453
but that is all   118.61416202747968
the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs élysées and made monte cristo raise his head   1.6912461191174373
only replied tréville it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue can not exempt a man from infamy and persecution   17.794937311780615
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last   66.6518553018859
your excellency will know when you have read the letter   29.321672817051464
cried athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong emotion   165.0450213785822
but wait wait   125.13745045902633
the trial at eight o clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp s door   169.47726732312503
but they might be the fruits of a plot   171.4403090078854
my honor will not survive it   99.48580986772741
of whom   105.18712336766312
dicers oaths   126.58947266020056
the count went out first then albert   49.189409632239645
m   205.25374365539935
eventually she was obliged to leave france   117.63805634179631
believe me i am glad to see you   180.64386044043505
but added he to change the conversation was this lady alone   93.46661785520678
milady answered by a glance which said is that all   176.58355043959858
he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other   146.23250482157835
exactly   149.72298120769852
well here i am   125.74627478648166
today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories   92.92974177202755
your highness had already expressed that wish said bertuccio and the horses are ready   162.12114117924804
such was the fashion of the day   155.97293554302664
and you shall be alone replied the young man   225.42898472825976
said the attendant   12.109352533451954
this was the more easy for our three companions in particular   196.597903264197
the councillor broussel is being arrested   66.08484064121748
we can watch the skipper   165.5271889765353
if i should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route   186.64702335958626
yes said milady   148.5635921934305
you will be able to indulge all your fancies   206.77839452626864
then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus   88.59527136301915
forget you   150.16818388044663
ja   182.80276352005623
and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him   73.3782493246928
and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance   193.17343752280476
instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour   216.90291022713336
this was their mutual declaration of love   84.87154957799899
during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath   48.84677950892302
fifty vessels were waiting to set out   240.16225825074346
these words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness   167.75669143639192
they had not seen him for two days   21.962056217317894
he came to demand the rent of my lodging   60.870094028923276
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought   130.29921331410947
taste that fowl and those fish   196.79462437743166
see what is going on monsieur d artagnan said he   30.045260357757343
you knew it   28.678659256321566
you must not leave me   199.63669803361202
600 000 700 000 800 000 900 000   74.76185587797195
which   124.06202893459682
we conceal ourselves and wait together   51.92471494077583
yes   109.54905686888708
what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion   79.67446052785509
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna   35.714707593334
go on i beg of you   136.8203024450593
alas i guess it   123.59039462789667
tell me   114.1905558377987
cried athos   126.79862199196788
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion   60.271181528649635
i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m   62.664315795270426
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men   79.37942230036259
that may happen one day   188.4512407837887
you m   69.67646473031671
although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief   72.290304869844
these words redoubled the eagerness of d artagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace   100.93594856721633
the abbé s chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbé s cell opened   49.55268960067161
to old times he said   180.9972886076436
faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to dantès who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust this 25th day of april 1498 be   133.3852011587027
why so   177.68694097493807
oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch   100.00414494164144
in the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of everything   92.77347885020924
but then athos would tell that she was branded   49.474649184998256
but you were speaking of haitians   142.53273301721921
that would have been difficult   9.662695623755226
you have kissed the queen s hand   95.6388676949451
and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints   117.84348039102393
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor   49.57219021007053
go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety   172.99929595897174
replied aramis   85.40524703928378
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing   194.27686251171326
the host drew back and burst into tears   237.09409285876194
and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform   293.21183563534987
say not so quickly returned monte cristo say not so my friends   134.19667768650294
and assured that he was at the catalans they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring   148.4349263382676
here s a rendezvous much more serious than the other   124.74757387343826
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at d artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship   75.16285949273865
unfortunately there are great words as there are great men   29.39917250749957
i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible   138.0665890732647
well you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him   78.04148420262536
aramis stipulated that bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that planchet should furnish the christening sugar plums   250.71628735360449
then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face   132.7730429938089
come he said it is only a veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of cavalcanti   122.73525298214308
ah   114.82443240240865
then you no longer love me   158.2945720514855
and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution   116.35899614746228
how do i know it   134.4209834748134
it was i the comte de la fere said athos rising and bowing respectfully to the duchess de chevreuse   60.008296251333434
at five o clock albert returned delighted with his day s work   124.17519357421952
ah   108.81448092616542
said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial love   17.210303274923206
at precisely six o clock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door   128.12797519112718
my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy   10.300829800102676
an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step   112.1042714247059
it will soon pass away and as he said so the old man s strength failed him and he fell backwards   41.949867112861554
but is it the custom for the officers in the english navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of great britain and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore   213.6159520834841
he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint méran s death recurred to him   59.79213852299992
i have been more than a year absent from paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut   151.76470843636417
for as i had the honor to tell you my wife loves me dearly my wife then came and confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great fears   173.3742767318392
the paralytic motioned yes   143.83593519562217
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done   228.28106904229998
said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer i sir   186.0998846663457
as to the commencement of an intrigue between her and m   36.98076095845151
one of them was a foreigner english i think   108.72487379007929
said louis xviii   55.10679281812064
yes   79.77685489850103
a table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the apartment   132.6310057515458
she asked with a nervous shudder   127.86372739392557
come then my friend we will go forward   74.03943870924982
the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty five years of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes   142.40918942539767
when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you   181.8248204051171
i will say then monsieur quite short   154.76388355757962
athos and d artagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the musketeer   59.32546264214637
you have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel   64.61167814628966
returned albert i compliment you on it   24.636671651497124
but his lips uttered no sound and as though all his strength were centred in that internal emotion he sighed and closed his eyes   156.62211019673052
why they may amount to said porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one   75.30043517882419
you know that   141.51143889778518
we can scud like the pharaon under bare poles   126.213885829578
but seven in two days i repeat it is too many it is far too many   134.17071682431478
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls   96.30518587303538
3 the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the owner of the project gutenberg™ trademark and any other party distributing a project gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement disclaim all liability to you for damages costs and expenses including legal fees   165.34905146122378
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death   13.424167492062736
the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him   139.92115550733195
nevertheless she remained motionless   82.40719995163697
he drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her eyes   133.14174932092428
look   140.95491342783322
it is likely   129.83886493971082
only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it   39.247006779284206
she is ill   70.04896559910092
now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain   174.99560498932613
morrel   166.23334952269178
but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past nine   218.63357296997324
i always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you   3.17054338305509
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water   158.324560220087
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive   181.98164161179517
and we too added beauchamp and château renaud   115.89314740232354
the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition   70.75038124503583
8 or 1   76.4009359876921
caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest   134.50210049474197
at this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching   97.79953174401675
danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of safety   65.77564824293026
yes i speak five of the modern tongues that is to say german french italian english and spanish   101.68165748394321
he was considered beforehand as a comrade   103.38091317656946
i did my best to make them drunk   182.5990446482454
are there any fresh instructions   103.27722047588341
i shall be fined   193.64744150961178
cried he   98.5719252948752
it was grimaud on his way to paris   164.83305741607813
yes   192.18355330519415
come come dearest valentine confess that what i say is true lest i be tempted to call you unjust   47.3268335562032
the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine s room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same moment   204.97400227676223
chapter lix   191.21682590334723
one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened to you lord de winter had said to felton   80.39240505445083
i will not suffer it   88.9967993755279
the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time   114.95905398390937
we must pursue them said groslow they can t be gone far and we will sink them passing over them   145.65815043881673
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving d artagnan learned that he exercised from six o clock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine o clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern   83.35853442513059
when you leave this you will behold my men at work   68.8657955550752
d avrigny show yourself a man   97.60672246614052
what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy   8.957815897332736
place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me   34.731035956941355
but all the italians are the same   106.32585097705714
mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength   99.2886466021242
it was almost broad daylight   139.96878294489642
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion that in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me   134.4042161009407
to bring news of monsieur de mazarin the freshest news there is   116.61858443889467
i shrink before nothing but impossibilities   147.2506169810106
in the name of heaven cried dantès speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me   144.68552981073466
i have written a letter today   209.11835545887493
bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice his excellency s horses   52.569785010646115
well what did he say then   126.63322026632883
meaning to say replied dantès with a smile which but ill concealed his trouble that if i were not a captain eh eh   181.01712869623123
and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves   174.12208763802147
ah   125.59213927011828
the comte de la fere   83.25554250716971
and driving the coadjutor s carriage   189.70784753438068
i will see them both returned the inspector   78.7535901935214
and in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group   173.75223618444093
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy   148.0629991951845
he pressed the count s hand and left   60.03966112535494
eh give it to me   177.75001167984996
good my friend good   115.20798136336603
what   156.14464552970173
you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle   103.10404129934724
whose is the ocean upon which we look   57.966156303906466
about noon   43.52810146794572
the banker was enthusiastic in his applause   169.7318619121756
faintly murmured fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance   195.8848141176048
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate   55.69360761105018
he said   103.13187168345405
what milady   94.0892505374735
well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu   66.60391031678449
he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma the one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery   95.85925268147625
here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man   27.40542290232814
d artagnan opened the letter and read these words a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest   164.41829864928064
there were only chimeras and illusions   159.38722209323635
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased   114.83368340800605
at each cross path was an orchestra and tables spread with refreshments   116.2848244352068
a gleam of light shone in aramis s eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by d artagnan   126.95112797033376
you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m   92.85086840706738
i await two persons and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table   196.98318946376315
listen he said   191.4482563364474
yes but i make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works   95.04472758007574
how you will go   152.89523473604177
i know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries   71.14890766405313
but the cardinal who feared that bassompierre a huguenot at heart might press but feebly the english and rochellais his brothers in religion supported the duc d angoulême whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant general   27.302395179642005
dead dead   189.01565581344812
he knows how as you must have observed to obey an order for you did not i am sure come from portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak   33.28093939677727
the groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porter s lodge saying pray does not the count of monte cristo live here   99.3691602133963
bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man   48.38183978973193
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival   16.252789490799387
do you prefer i should seek m   120.59129367967581
if you do not return how does it concern you   83.61734298927234
wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard   149.2423794665625
the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace   137.76522534235875
read the address   154.26790785823957
certainly   235.07818518500682
athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not d artagnan   139.1132780892525
oh   208.56934088750455
said blaisois   163.40759227393713
said d artagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted pardieu it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend s house   155.7363363456774
on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other   162.87519802495598
but with the hope of soon becoming enemies   155.09519970878395
have you ever seen him   139.9593179530131
i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said planchet   137.72065083375531
i thought you were at smyrna   26.094272038838213
d artagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence   74.6813350973725
listen   34.94898634937471
your note of this morning has completely bewildered me   194.40414374255852
and why not   161.73899843258965
d artagnan and porthos went on meantime to paris   127.64578920895298
oh take it take it said the count   132.2149077635616
she is already late   117.75158709625394
then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber   125.02764737144173
this account confirmed that of the mayor   8.180393216390968
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god   14.317352062025492
this milady this woman this creature this demon has a brother in law as i think you told me d artagnan   123.18701002587707
but this time the terrible brother in law of milady did not content himself as on the preceding day with passing before the door and going away again   172.268770318103
but you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you   155.72898851145737
ruined yes that is it   97.85551850576407
the latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current   201.8464306250659
how droll it is   203.9522144260045
i know that sir   91.57792381926208
d artagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction stay you where you are and don t you stir or i will pull this ear off   65.2787140578446
anne de bueil   114.79586740321265
i am young gently replied haydée   129.54998764650125
franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian   133.86376246720835
i again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from you   103.44963642283244
eustache   89.63700208296012
do you place confidence in our landlord monsieur bonacieux   109.18475184021989
it has its own effect upon the most incredulous   236.53841057149998
mine was carried away by a ball   141.99827645756957
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you   166.39318644267667
but how did he obtain it   24.923125183041634
but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriage horses and i do not think they were dear   96.67583928090667
we have scarcely left him two hours ago he does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are   139.72319662738846
benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin   146.27833215229563
but asked danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalities the contract the settlement   125.12205100981997
this child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor s orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden   104.24255598576525
30145m oh very simply   109.77902282859597
and now madame try to make your peace with god for you are judged by men   137.01840330460297
said kitty timidly   82.5004998663294
yes i am vice president   35.015458933459115
it appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush   142.87848677998124
one last favor my lord   225.056647623779
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass   146.22732021842606
yes   20.134979986916335
there is a carriage coming said château renaud   202.20413980713693
well he shall live   196.5098260927144
coquenard she could not restrain her tears   179.80532043614147
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber   124.29914744181275
no replied the turnkey   55.78459537980673
when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream   16.26611740530447
a favorite   190.7704056081759
the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances   169.96920496937474
cried buckingham i really think he threatens me   91.9224914946293
but the door closed   209.5483350510466
what said debray laughing   178.7552198540253
40062m well what is haydée to ali tepelini   118.75670052651698
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and one nights   90.68250623046802
no   35.98842057062589
do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard her shield the pledge for her dignity for her fortune and her life   206.61078559364654
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity   166.69947786734315
go go   31.298857993075146
the storm broke about ten o clock   126.2829813277117
mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of d artagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles   169.83808337424358
she would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly madame danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy   173.9316322036223
well then i am your servant monsieur baron said d artagnan though you have names rather difficult to recollect   175.4838387257166
certainly sir   157.64132797379153
i know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue m   161.12655076909795
the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix our modern rubens   147.77140436494616
i consent on condition that la ramee tries them with me   166.15493336966784
and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible   91.38819767592115
you give away horses worth a thousand louis   165.5855852338658
you will come to me or you will let me come to you   178.02491321606695
no mercy sir   78.7347087319759
at that moment they heard the gallop of a horse   36.58805530598349
merely the term unlimited nothing else certainly   76.45082584525906
go on d artagnan   44.37316190483688
on the 1st morrel returned   14.041108330582233
at the moment he was about to go out lord de winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of milady   205.53963181143146
four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that i have earned and i ought to take ten to the owner   217.97384146289323
the shops were deserted houses closed   120.6384999614363
am i come to a friend   78.02016111238777
and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful   128.32009557958366
artless as she was the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave and besides madame de villefort came to her assistance   210.2158823462444
well you do not reply   207.24104818194493
not old cavalcanti   199.65817164312745
now let us return to the first   54.318829103174835
by me   121.99867939543157
for i am low very low   18.402605893216204
there was nothing but gilding high and low   158.96973927484947
perhaps he may   134.20081770617494
no it is unnecessary   202.74234012872932
lean upon me and let us return to the camp   203.438743735934
this lad for he was scarcely a man simple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for   97.81833539378313
d artagnan continued athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge   101.16699703560161
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock   65.69761075291473
le comte de soissons by the grand prior by the duc de longueville by the duc d eubœuf by the comte d harcourt by the comte de la roche guyon by m   69.57565058660172
really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned   163.63119991020156
faith   125.82555845535173
they were descending the steps leading to the cavern   152.96983394692307
but this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just   193.32137588762524
every one arose   84.97198054227997
she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate   99.72118687057423
but asked dantès how long shall i have to wait   34.08751326594289
we can only save you by being free ourselves replied d artagnan in a rapid low tone   4.803302415132222
very possibly   145.3070574038781
you gave de wardes a meeting on thursday last in this very room did you not   167.17800263993146
and king charles x   7.92080811430678
egad   59.518254837209035
when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say he s a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master   91.5328303534641
the valet re entered   112.12097634737096
i shall be on the king s left and as i am the chief person threatened remain at the coach door to the left   104.37115362178773
they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message   205.4126000445659
tis well   134.54506287587617
the sea smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element   131.02624555720104
d artagnan and porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet   175.6294709402244
with whom can it be if not the duke of the duke of yes monsieur replied the citizen giving a still fainter intonation to his voice   124.73851544814272
that will be the signal when i call out jesus seigneur   166.08081448622806
said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever   134.3921136787546
they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself   136.61879441506073
but you expected some one then   153.83347775000686
i see that you are right logically speaking said maximilian   102.41043153941183
de tréville s was as gay and cheerful as possible   179.87368828930403
athos you make me tremble   170.3541338276455
what   133.08608633390696
noirtier s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villefort s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man s heart   69.44169184047949
you have proved it   176.4105930313464
a true friend s eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me   172.56452340772623
at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground   95.00580772454012
alas said andrea sighing one can not be completely happy in this world   146.81496379316332
the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose   87.79377133736955
that dear protector said caderousse   110.48156373582411
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration   60.20985137525261
is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it   217.0616968102508
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur d herblay   97.59439266505089
but don t exceed your orders   151.03016337661035
i am ready   149.23679221215474
and you have reason for she is much to be pitied   93.03826691016349
my uncle replied mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken   94.44760810440526
then i confess curiosity mingled with hatred   93.30658038733111
that was my intention   292.28987503023006
and passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the door   241.64423262415778
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night   159.4514855259992
come in my host   162.10016235226317
how unfortunate i am   100.20900046364595
sir said m   143.72652119996906
at ferrara tasso s prison   84.9625256720951
you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly   95.5945444331363
muttered danglars   54.896719771267215
yes   255.55683806628642
and now absolve me for i am dying   130.44513084646908
do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat   163.16997261875122
his heart beat but not like d artagnan s with a young and impatient love   111.21104474477801
he entered by the faubourg st   44.310778850238506
no   220.9671159210729
but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé   151.81741535213143
such was albert s opinion of the count and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it   4.88691891452207
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman   155.87884599811989
mousqueton s horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his companions   204.06146129020553
one takes no note of time   228.69656547812087
it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that   153.4707010981282
and then i knew you were seeking me   84.80641836854844
he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet   78.77386959481913
said danglars   187.86939874259588
sir replied caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception   172.3649460244409
you hear major bartolomeo cavalcanti a man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of italy whose name dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of the inferno you remember it do you not   21.26449929439319
you can not be speaking seriously athos   44.42676546237497
we must accustom ourselves to parting   101.65421381362454
where to   70.93200232969099
don t be uneasy about that   217.72704057062407
the appetite grows by what it feeds on said caderousse grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling   79.15421407040324
de tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were dead   110.5047060659256
pardon me doctor these worldly ideas   11.059985239382371
it was no longer the same man the fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him   137.17989748706592
then at least turn the gem inside you silly fellow   122.1936721364484
all was over   113.00608247340682
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone   72.54833177582714
but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination and above all that d artagnan would also be lost to her forever   145.1275564202245
the closet was empty   53.684546015234126
m   181.96875994413335
d artagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets   47.2825792827971
i he said   73.18026138595695
30123m so sir you lived at lucca did you   115.81339502737347
i don t understand was the reply   115.51077971655955
but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly   23.622070577322347
project gutenberg is a registered trademark   184.4846939321369
my faith said d artagnan   186.88806104765877
chapter 7   162.57310234343848
but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention   173.13556993479446
and the party must be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to london   253.8741816315055
at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myself for i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear   170.3248350078644
if they do not bring us peace we will give them war   87.43370431511511
bonacieux knocked as at the shutter three light and regular taps   179.37138083001565
why did he kill himself instead of you   32.93389180444841
emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight   122.57900170941289
you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph   41.62039866045136
stop   168.4855097355084
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot   88.9688196986205
d artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by planchet at the same pace   25.51512724019291
but for my own part i shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you   65.94275582123129
1   169.07967266949353
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively   155.52219712062643
bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain   42.91160138942172
nearly   85.73730387882037
we on our side do the same   30.305775956152857
yes monsieur a most excellent sister   134.05262598528415
a family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal   175.19921281670605
only a few days replied monte cristo   249.5753485217427
tell me now if persistence is not a virtue   184.0840139518152
after the king and the cardinal m   20.423631187538774
there they are coming out   121.00429812785589
he was not mistaken   132.59353575931624
when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos porthos drew his dripping hand from the font   187.2109364459896
and what does mademoiselle d armilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil   43.36994894446275
what took place at portsmouth august 23 1628 felton took leave of milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her hand   222.2549243179551
and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame   126.02441763637111
cried the baron   118.64674239416124
in your case it would be a crime   153.82059557043445
that is to say beauty meekness and tears and above all the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness the most devouring of all voluptuousness   89.96271081234096
at the moment you left his house   226.31506380916016
he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to bristol   126.4579106378723
the baron took the pen and signed then the representative   0.44786738756812383
the greatest possible gayety prevailed at court   112.79670935603468
but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin where three or four men went and came like shadows   129.03498720831246
is mine   346.81796277779955
i think so forsooth said rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the bastile   113.07905295350294
he had but one fault he was a gourmand   176.1497031931126
ah   97.1696087701228
and planchet dined by sleeping   97.21083219764981
barrois therefore as we have seen watched for valentine and informed her of her grandfather s wish   13.576850782712995
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand   107.91732962042549
but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening ah   65.40362730742274
but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him   84.63841592017404
answer sir exclaimed he   43.38561953963536
i shall wait for you here till seven   113.58842761514637
federal laws and your state s laws   252.85923169971647
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary   140.7677890075326
30191m and are you going there   81.78307694221473
said porthos that is what you meant to say   52.39190825294608
at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectators romans italians strangers from all parts of the world the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius   131.22476776108587
ah why were you not there gentlemen   116.11973666579289
we see that danglars was collected enough to jest   25.03413264831927
ah   33.58096649469343
besides should any ill luck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended   84.87442735031631
and what may you have to say to him   189.1145370708788
while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra   78.21409943798967
that is enough to take us to london and back   249.64069019121482
as they say in my country   104.5421673663565
some parting words to his friends   264.91835076108987
albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume   137.98082989429864
scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valet de chambre called out make ready   195.507814851585
well m   124.24499412735531
albert rose to return to his place   235.5392265760093
what is the matter barrois   111.19325698527139
bonacieux called a long time   157.1792392960727
noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal   85.25681127571858
cried anne of austria   146.42417551191008
morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother in law   32.11483084593486
d artagnan now no longer counted the sighs   168.70600979818317
yet like providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my heart   114.17245055551663
come don t look so angry and you shall have 4 000 francs of the money to do what you like with and eugénie shall have 2 000   90.72581467659204
ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents   155.57917709610803
but he stopped on the landing   103.10428702900177
well i am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you   99.04615270354472
and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize twenty   19.08180964013718
grimaud nodded   106.51750846503106
dantès cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude   106.44954580115214
monseigneur i see well that i must call grimaud   175.6229973269477
to questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be given   104.33448372612983
in fact four men such as they were four men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives   70.50197001772085
you have only escaped from mademoiselle danglars piano to be attacked by haydée s guzla   150.27518252026692
it is only half past ten o clock come in   138.53395448218083
and its aim is   17.43249625242524
now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper   166.90288735199024
yes and i take your brother with me   177.0267411204301
and as a proof of what i say permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound   155.46259767831444
gendarmes i am at your service   47.87358368467906
everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently   192.54511495217457
to yours my gentlemen   135.44922391685145
many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best view   181.28043006368267
monte cristo lets fall his purse   113.57066439737082
he cried   38.03881623214009
at last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot   153.54036552287343
capital   85.63312906875169
and where am i   71.72792231626721
how sirrah   114.17550465053228
but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her   131.53225815043584
the company was then heard departing   106.56850818160042
tis true   68.27649206355335
and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding friends everywhere   117.65995532096545
and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer   83.11934417201479
and as i am only a musketeer provisionally i hold it good to be prudent   145.78015309517892
what is she doing then   132.5226205811068
there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third time   279.4902626964513
albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there   51.368394633646005
he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen s apartments   183.825898461512
foreigner   66.55728694360266
and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was justified   110.3546667884414
mordaunt remained standing near the door   181.82637080507743
now i recollect danglars himself passed by just as captain leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal   87.34922453644269
you will appear at this ball   155.39310714771554
go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had disappeared   85.20535162050254
what does your chamber open on   96.7257998458271
oh yes   180.36064346688823
and attention   81.13060011792173
yours is a noble nature   95.32964101109374
friend porthos said d artagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and i of my captaincy   117.21886725051954
i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality   66.69928885516828
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first   192.41522727021407
that is sufficient   115.89101161659633
beware my dear d artagnan   128.14250442932212
and dauphiné sir   52.262265772968135
the devil   142.8728487203461
the abbé faria   200.79559782221872
his shoulder knots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it   195.0182166068259
said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated   147.14918348210827
a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions   168.4344772056345
they close it   75.54921376658785
i agree to it too said porthos if d artagnan approves of it   145.547632416822
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village   173.7059980710623
well as for me i prefer hannibal   71.76053188958034
impossible   64.20290715498767
you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal s guards have so many proofs   66.10251830663091
la ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor   74.52392726341208
his musketeers proceeded and followed him   104.64702560770682
i do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of september   182.88597518389486
about three months ago i was near having a duel with aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house for a handkerchief marked in the same manner i am sure   193.6471380602006

said the abbé in a peculiar tone he is happy   140.85738227839684
then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart   111.76252088796748
then he will sell them to some eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects   117.53864237028843
he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours paris would be under arms   78.03634386056616
do you not know these bits of paper   196.45071528433573
what is that to you jacopo   202.84831417689583
ah you fancy so   12.87256713268728
it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle   177.0293733614075
wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man   46.05811931368217
is your name bonacieux   228.91813280313642
but what is the meaning of this change   86.2932232260799
now then what had i better do   165.63088992438952
as he thus reasoned monte cristo walked down the rue de la caisserie   223.16295720192105
long live the duc de beaufort   127.87420621759048
and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him   108.45015182755331
said d artagnan   82.20502979574664
tomorrow perhaps he may change you   228.93515628811429
i followed her i caught her i bound her   82.751303800213
scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cæsar s podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a half dilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin   155.37755785598878
it was a long time before i was able to make out what place i was in or to take account of the details i describe   105.3204341956623
athos threw himself into d artagnan s arms   111.64449261345105
for the poison which she pours there is no antidote   168.87774182871917
pen ink and paper muttered fernand   102.06301722947
a queen accustomed to be obeyed i am excited at the first opposition   128.69902976391631
from monsieur laporte   138.61607931038148
ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadjutor   18.492598283262197
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur   134.8982499362882
but d artagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to kitty s door   34.858748426496675
just so   76.58074371857145
ah   224.72679878226205
then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject porthos called the host and asked for dice   161.8559782368879
and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father s conduct added the incorrigible marquise   66.48660460200605
i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the road to nîmes   114.56134401326312
you forget aramis one precaution of considerable importance   81.65748522880338
here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm eaten table which with the stool and the goat skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell   57.95459177684043
already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by debray   98.6888467768224
and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour   52.06919706828161
but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor   60.16622211463289
madame bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted   118.33634287471335
inquired dantès   104.8941493200447
said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult   82.2793795201202
true said noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is   86.61841925069194
yes chimed in la carconte they will have a wretched night of it   150.96780481694117
these devils of english how suspicious they are   96.76219565197516
oh if you are struck in france if you die in france if i could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death i could not console myself   210.95359735286252
what is the matter dear grandfather   59.30441200849397
you are mistaken you will not die   133.3703462279833
and you athos you know something of everything and can be our captain   244.42867783374356
did you say a misfortune   191.8676817821064
does she come to borrow money of me   134.64709695509148
and was he not so   100.90722619680619
the young man pressed her to his heart   88.88164577868481
and remember my life depends on your answer   265.86681663143753
andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him   60.01895988433287
yes quite   127.26043152427513
he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife port   117.55448048947693
nay nay   16.366695933891464
the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half hour s interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes   79.46900373741097

in the course of the forenoon monsieur de beaufort had a game of tennis with la ramee   32.859945195683835
petersburg the other five leagues from naples   116.90836406955422
this was now all changed   26.951261510719263
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose   194.33757866916227
grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself   95.55728776354545
milady smiled   102.06515834808908
during the examination of milady by the officer as may well be imagined milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances   216.1219786869554
my own service   128.0529289352307
from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise   184.49683361588475
it was ten o clock at night   71.0544848244341
my god   118.68253546803217
now then what do you say to that   108.6364821973023
now jump down athos   72.77918766896184
morrel   50.602009383223006
said porthos   197.60136333715633
i am ready   158.09463670846662
but what can four men or rather three men do for i tell you you must not count on monsieur d artagnan   160.71003518542872
who would ever have thought it   78.00065660144082
as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations   118.2723160009065
oh sire exclaimed the duc de blacas m   145.2765122068158
andrea andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian name   32.22706711732435
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel   10.052951734393773
d artagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and love   7.266843977784845
and i hope to prove to you that you have not served an ingrate   104.95606108816901
cried porthos and aramis in a breath   79.32350111178516
and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity   96.46693379973306
to be sure   135.10894564732013
cried the calm voice of athos from the other side of the door let them just come in these devourers of little children and we shall see   61.46048336779096
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse   82.22457824900852
some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the door   83.39516878146448
yes sire as they always do   207.286982767021
beauchamp did the same   224.892242872765
de morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society   228.4038325538479
it interests me very much cried d artagnan   170.95585945621497
look gentlemen all   80.15388816771485
grimaud dictated   134.89091051486085
besides with these men s clothes will you dress here   212.90771565834024
perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight   138.9137052308371
i follow you though i am not hungry   36.81814859553292
and gabrielle d estrees as good natured as brave as proud and above all as gascon as his ancestor but less elaborately educated   64.05749078781825
not yet i think   38.05172079377202
noirtier closed his eyes   123.62631345147014
send your saddle then to the hôtel of the musketeers and your horse can be brought back with ours   74.84847338183638
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so   111.74686346587933
didn t i say that your police were good for nothing   121.02220754265241
you are a soldier and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war   208.51518634404053
they passed into the eating room a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen   101.60977753799081
exclaimed lucien   197.64200883159486
i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear   207.88603592810944
at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debray s apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions   25.231685351047133
responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain   175.1125923047478
and so i did replied caderousse   181.73823582710347
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write   195.75208254612693
said the voice   59.79918687287889
said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings   133.50797250037238
the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe   127.93402883052234
above all she is very rich at least i believe so said monte cristo   116.41710334665255
shot my dear boy   37.54575676811095
could you have swum so far   38.35589762864164
then adieu valentine   154.73509504098146
and what method of surveillance do you employ   100.68369234420612
exclaimed the man half suffocated   140.27118463099183
capital   198.88333289071295
what   105.79766973013217
milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness   84.24928090569433
but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence   115.3389237565871
in short groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception   76.4732498604669
alicante if you please   159.27645173389135
you wore a close ruff a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe and in that cap a heron s feather   104.84753253506447
the interview for which i ask is of us two alone and i very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted   127.54853569143259
30261m it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a half circle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglars it is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation   191.89066699001785
he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristo s eye was on him   117.53467900149163
but do you mean to say you have not heard of this   38.46552305395498
continued the false abbé   49.06514372144544
felton give me that knife   148.63567728940765
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man   45.38744611705684
you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning   28.60735376947774
in short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops   55.266709964212424
my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble   169.89698092508357
i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son in law of the marquis and marquise de saint méran   157.54064584674924
i believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his   229.34724772388654
it would indeed be strange if she checked herself   107.8259088476689
this letter was in milady s handwriting   166.899649649376
he now determined not to begin the game with d artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary s cards   219.72539771254856
you do not know my mother   67.58591166794443
then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure   70.78713677614012
tell us about it   117.64195541515979
indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity   97.68104600292108
now the mischief is out   164.2675931034223
while the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husband s strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan   44.8913530728758
fight the more for duels being forbidden since consequently there is twice as much courage in fighting   80.13113024353967
well sir what you tell me is impossible   111.84813092058424
ah to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband mercédès and to lose that hope which was the only stay of my existence   34.94412120776698
oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly   175.22465694253782
yes said mme   192.80616256834446
noirtier stopped him at the last named sum   135.43396341469708
monsieur grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine planchet from head to foot   74.98859142031952
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor   103.07139793833811
thanks monsieur   1.6966691068224407
you must be mad   228.10960393498596
you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor   118.49065099620911
farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously   152.82619575211262
then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners   108.20684304972794
his wife   18.410533176499214
and yet he reckoned and with reason on milady   144.35265860175355
de tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to believe   52.06443304528908
that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument   180.5828140353527
s   125.93029566721022
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry   126.48754684847303
there is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime   158.72683333722009
meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good   39.62663248393763
while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from athos   235.54091671783988
what fine things we would do together   86.47817127884176
36 rue de la victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted louise   185.42887475175073
i arose trembling   42.93933605929374
in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes   109.5169797677792
400340m a note was in consequence addressed to general de quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the 5th   136.50002332618166
do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel   41.08019844431999
and now you will do me a favor will you not   65.50749656240274
no i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the cardinal   92.78090398044837
can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition   127.89322577883735
since you left toulon what have you lived on   95.09032189348729
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men   70.1009811846831
oh   217.78910548119154
and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to him   68.28197197821383
it was indeed aramis   171.38672870141335
yes a chef d oeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied athos   58.120134536476975
de tréville announced that it was time to go to the louvre   200.22898509898863
and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair   61.810872428890484
debray was not yet come but albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera   9.509158671577524
ah   191.6776865995954
the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative   169.03458698708792
and then changing the conversation all at once athos said by the by i thank you for the horse you have brought me   8.856228145134082
he bowed humbly and retired   188.07171168926362
he understood the old man s meaning   83.95578783121793
the usher returned and made a sign to d artagnan to follow him   114.88079781275708
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir   1.4373631445189687
i was sure it was so the hanging of people is my nightmare   1.3569478150637195
thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings   99.26101274753596
his right name was noirtier de villefort   150.66023007446782
a great poet   66.86705732139177
no   73.63273576530283
three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound   160.85998552944497
he started and the prisoner saw that start for though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her   89.92877708487059
and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted   142.06512642841852
well and then   136.72223888837024
has it ever happened to you   139.89594253076643
i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me   141.10477401203542
they like to unite their fortunes   146.47456325252273
what has happened then   245.54248868428346
there are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty   174.0783262014352
i mean that m   54.66514401599243
at these words bertuccio turned pale   256.6154355585647
yes yes i   128.86483307962578
as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and renée in waiting   149.0948612197912
50063m ah   293.54480289974964
john felton i trust your word   24.699647929417225
charles perceived it and took his hand   88.20372454254262
don t you see my brave felton   161.90023945938896
when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheard of that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs   71.88885779544933
and why do you represent providence   152.6547431965256
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris   82.61782855717357
i have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest   46.863661547293205
that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé   94.51873608932112
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon   118.38311984403869
he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion   150.74226801817386
this time there could be no doubt   35.020586814901975
i am still beautiful   113.9893452732285
the young man is better said danglars   65.06369567763855
you can not be mistaken   166.14216412748402
from haydée   153.5319934968233

you will take your musketoon and your pistols   66.84696611768686
but aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke s finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him   76.06186316522908
cried he to the coachman   112.03432093541214
and bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket   171.86337157921014
it appears that milady and i are anxious about the health of the same person   177.56233061794086
but i make war in my own way   172.14515894541705
like a patient miner i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence   177.30711133465587
said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you   167.06172487888665
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart   101.90403194028201
patrick   214.977921008875
why you are mad albert   183.62294801083846
noirtier would have left her all his money   251.94704953899225
i ran to the hospital and learned that the same night the night of the 20th of september a child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half   74.99869426760843
he was put in a dungeon   161.56099990960433
words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step   46.472781049690695
he therefore looked forward to six o clock with as much impatience as the duke himself   173.54481634914313
recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine   1.270461781635916
don t be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal   87.67984321337283
his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée when suddenly the door opened   105.98850219923406
and he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper   38.2541596928355
we shall soon see said porthos in his tranquil way   131.30443887693056
yes said the executioner   220.09129761130342
he has broken his ribs said the commander in a low voice   197.23302432149657
what is it   129.11799509133132
0317m when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him   170.9297333570865
i had provided myself with a dark lantern   136.20446242533552
the name of father is sacred in two senses   171.74969758014072
have you the wick   152.31503376528724
go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come   70.29915474787602
no said morrel   227.85150547123578
unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn   90.03533281923407
i know he is a gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me   152.97699625470204
and that   85.70839317609833
who   125.72454579083823
go there   143.72656511436426
what is your sister valentine doing   173.41696000520517
at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also   158.14969935933345
all eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse   107.3446310261862
i shall retire and die tranquilly at home   207.72263508758564
he himself was not in question but his horse was   113.76723568198547
albert turned   128.98901854138518
what do you intend to do   131.1632814110158
pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please   116.09678966808724
the four or five remaining hours before nine o clock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visits designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker s in their gayest equipages dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative   81.10270258727562
but they were uttered in the romaic dialect   147.7025189943014
athos s idea   144.59699760107242
debray m   84.97904468489406
they don t burn sorcerers nowadays   83.88792045916475
this very instant   171.7300759342856
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever   89.20310577767691
d artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen   123.50112341467482
and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant general the count of morcerf peer of france   123.71490696446986
only for him it passed more slowly   18.81160885111234
but although her voice sweet full and sonorous vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut   179.9829143921965
nothing can be more agreeable to me   53.807793714849595
c   168.24841209740526
i i mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers   177.56002639545375
and how much is the pension   190.91367389324478
that s well said d artagnan   15.522429539185566
as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning   105.23786524850289
on seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you   106.94474983647297
above all things be always on your guard   39.88902522044985
the queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence   242.6468169474529
what are you saying sir   229.82078510038434
the true one as you say   101.9517601462539
i rescued from the hands of mazarin s police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile where he had been for five years   107.67234680169797
as you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon   136.88862598910328
which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july replied danglars   68.83944915711717
at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him   127.63976000593306
you are thoughtful said mazarin uneasily   166.9963632997365
as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance   92.76705918155156
gentlemen said he monseigneur s order is you know to conduct that woman without losing time to fort la pointe and never to leave her till she is on board   177.0746561831942
i breathe more freely   15.636402490990406
the celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the count s possession   79.09591989079345
the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on   120.23626349821396
at the end of a few minutes monsieur raised his voice and said i want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended upon   131.0803644487927
and yet that villain benedetto will escape   44.7577129635652
and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of st   146.40237660533586
in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentine s   177.80255463393186
sir replied mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall   158.009327116428
the treasure when dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found faria seated and looking composed   157.78449776167324
asked albert   103.54068666421301
thank you my friend thank you   96.23774127660603
he has this moment returned   21.37910523581303
is not this true fernand   153.66464214742365
no pardieu no   95.19295941360058
that evening d artagnan went to present his respects to m   105.07879654690205
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force   150.52468846490896
is yours   113.49101410052846
it is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine   216.96534171872025
all is not then over   168.56662569398313
at these words madame morrel rose and threw herself into her son s arms   185.11192980084948
crown pieces only silver pieces   135.10639646987593
athos shook his dead doubtfully   191.92774879320245
de saint méran   99.31043844894872
he pretends the air of the faubourg saint honoré is not good for me   154.45049242297839
you don t know him perhaps but i know him   101.11906027512691
that is well said the king retiring that is well   179.64502653513594
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence d artagnan went straight to the residence of athos   64.18848295864112
you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived or was expected   128.46388598930147
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to d artagnan s chair   58.39185714041526
the game began   117.93652615313547
swear first on your honor not to inform him of our return   224.0826360477552
he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that monsieur mordaunt   63.60650391020001
grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere   111.82953404477212
he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial   105.79619911875825
no   101.70412869537807
the sergeant began to laugh   28.975240930008482
but she declined availing herself of it   43.49533533309288
then turning toward planchet he made him a sign to uncock his musketoon   127.2985238724409
good bye till we meet again   54.62188926287703
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed   79.96538259481888
he asked   79.42464098350442
at the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads   136.52074457446727
anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head   121.57572496447938
the duc d angoulême on the east from dompierre to perigny   104.77849846627664
i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero   110.12570472627252
yes   91.56327365714675
if anything yet remains of that great that sublime king henry of whom you have just spoken he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself   234.65800682629555
are the english expected by land or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers   14.05764955848818
you know that i am not alluding to you   123.20463489323036
he was the first to jump on shore   59.25313397879384
albert she asked did you notice that   118.60129752410447
put the gag in grimaud   95.48925422361563
an event took place in the church of st   29.23742424841049
at the end of the piece étienne entered and announced to eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits   9.643277830034691
once outside he and planchet set off as fast as they could   152.09835343720286
adieu adieu   60.49018701777294
oh their heads are soon cut off said danglars   141.98667313881958
what the devil captain one can not win all one s battles   133.32579851064327
then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta   202.67262816513238
today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect him it is equally your duty   139.49445125465812
well he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from paris an invalid ordered country air for his health   1.6223413008652443
your son shall be happy mercédès repeated the count   136.54053240623477
i will find him as i told you   28.80582331565978
but you know he is now our friend   127.73750983769372
at ten in the evening if that suits you   90.08411584230812
i do not know that   204.09086966550115
he launched into a eulogy of his eminence and said that he should not have failed to enter into the guards of the cardinal instead of the king s guards if he had happened to know m   96.44050844759708
you have water woods flowers there   53.60457131826311
he then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs   55.83217525520883
by degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will   11.009962189185543
are you for mazarin or for the princes   147.91433655365717
well what next   104.17289128622174
save the queen   111.2514637171227
upon my word said monte cristo paris is a strange city and the parisians a very singular people   122.94270351883121
the queen spoke with some impatience   162.49551205693678
in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being   180.06559228815365
that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him   128.3824752292036
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brother in law monsieur de tréville is particularly attached to their majesties   108.0695314032596
oh yes especially beautiful   62.488795693677694
where is valentine sir   104.22168819206857
you would like very well to be at liberty on that beach   65.08696828942351
in twenty minutes they were at auteuil   70.43044558886524
well yes pretty well replied d artagnan   106.0835509374561
but in that same banker s study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocket money you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry   198.2782805728442
that of athos carelessness   130.08935228154732
you have lived on the money he has given you   70.6640747972941
d artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him   42.733837045127785
bonacieux re entered   64.28754390592798
if you will help me to drag myself from under my horse i hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey   141.0998496118163
no said aramis but that fellow is a fiend   82.09671866978624
very good   114.3122437981873
of a woman who calls herself your friend   207.9457893091698
but my dear love reflect a little upon what you require of me   178.84345164599398
therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects   141.8429726907356
here s half a pistole   117.02463084037207
to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellow a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer   56.777193376878635
not the least in the world   51.907932852918776
what letter   107.18005056160148
yes monsieur i know only him   158.16400084817766
one day to rest there   9.12158808802478
i have distrusted god   141.01339186525888
for within an hour the ballet will commence   196.002635298421
and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said porthos   233.97391274595444
and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear   182.98106198918322
yes as an augustine monk   7.217058516479298
de villefort was as usual unmoved   130.75264731935346
at the same time he felt the duke s arms on his shoulders like two iron claws   74.22157264862176
now let us go   155.89730812889195
better my lord   128.8506634534168
i do   118.74501292833074
egad said d artagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren   240.33321890012922
and who is this friend   180.82404109768507
calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship   145.30127036282656
how much   167.4384256618599
yes if we are better mounted than he   51.05234438528154
morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained   199.9758663841305
dantès waited expecting a question but in vain   18.7852609444802
we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them   99.4309065061839
yes said aramis i understand   62.727966233784514
yes   17.365143913428298
yes   126.85177947235995
monsieur porthos was six feet high   37.70584013293042
but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation   185.2611537453854
tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you   47.7782106807463
leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret   231.36044457552828
and as night was approaching and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next day   196.65885990082404
he could not believe in such a miracle   110.38929468984973
i thank you madame said he for the deference you have shown to my wishes but i think you want two of the studs and i bring them back to you   73.73143538598687
and remember that two legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others   65.5472527183896
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m   194.79445660575635
1 through 1   162.4698942044554
counting his treasures replied the governor   172.61877283087782
ah   95.31697515030231
one can no more now reckon on one s friends than on one s footmen said porthos   121.50634067578365
but the culprit   81.49378167642094
cried d artagnan   127.61466263928916
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the king s bed ready to die for him   143.03209329867974
d artagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and listened   134.35838996910155
the place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions d artagnan had conceived   73.63605639053736

god grant you as much   86.84767445320927
danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed   168.31972086323952
the idea was not that of a christian i knew   146.36358288012343

but as before she expected him in vain   131.55853493733954
three or four times he started up imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing him   74.23544001847056

the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression   64.50821821363428
a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was   54.024282908976986
comminges had seen rightly and mordaunt had really acted as he had related   130.17262853617373
i have replied morrel   54.95412923072906
he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed   47.332648757591386

morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say here i am maximilian   7.436601861409812
and you understand that they would have saved the king   129.19339995090502

the explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present   151.8389381084082
then assisted by bicarat the only one left standing they bore jussac cahusac and one of aramis s adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the convent   166.01502047726575
listen said he   223.29943267538903
said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast   124.89608880121662
maximilian villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief   83.86684488713016

alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again   82.07408443711418
to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause death so pay attention to it my dear monsieur danglars   81.83282803900352

these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo   21.359676934061383
the day passed thus   157.76855853729637

pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors   136.11535441954243
well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple   99.32430528975715
and at this moment albert had nothing more transpired your father s cause had been gained   107.00781681639373
besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man   94.82734121157284

in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand   126.12253070032725
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent   60.64639474389265

they know me by heart and are steeled against all my weapons   172.9842567326563
it is too bad a habit   124.55970531963841
god help me   68.58194280082188
let us talk of something else said he   43.063171829128464
they are hot royalists said groslow   165.4769763963996

war has broken out in flanders   8.252967147140481

dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles   136.54011495951104
captain groslow   92.60859721055674
he alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps   96.98691667203536
ah   181.42769035383918
sir replied monte cristo coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs   112.06184517693079
with the queen sir   99.78428050929676
then he said aloud the queen my lord   122.32906860307648
yes but beer   95.96633291811185
he resolved not to reach noisy in the day for fear of being recognized   49.409930342620584
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect   83.07810885627703
said d artagnan drawing his pistols from his belt you will kill nobody if you please   232.6631882856877
in a splendid chamber of the palais royal formerly styled the palais cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers   128.99962988183665
there is another way said morrel   110.64150507091303
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating   58.23189028652277
bring her in said the president   87.87052139799864
the queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question   234.31178458705625
who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed   245.98970581335715
at châlons i was put upon the saône thence i passed on to the rhône whence i descended merely with the current to arles   160.5155393254347
mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage   180.09734117300164
and i say that murders are committed here said morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months   71.63144169199492
but is there anything impossible for my d artagnan the noble and loyal gentleman   64.36346331671189
asked mazarin   98.29806112432887
this is all very easy for you to say replied d artagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him   48.855852564958425
no said villefort burying his face in his hands no a hundred times no   115.53627233264359

albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hands as if to prevent the light from reaching him   60.47073378083254
oh very easily   189.56463190449205
at this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure   150.26915177732727
in the eyes of many benedetto appeared if not a victim to at least an instance of the fallibility of the law   214.35480728867466
but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine   38.41756680158829
when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place   164.0032069085686
the felucca is mined said d artagnan   89.06051502310335
i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself   21.440864398106868

gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through   28.03928169485104
then i shall also remain   207.1846335171063
the count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart   232.37513260014057
one moment yes answered the queen   120.19289993186972
cried the young woman falling on her knees   179.22223026933
one of the two guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after that   193.45224452221458
how is that mousqueton   120.88754577823167

henrietta maria and mazarin   160.28064067005602
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horses one for himself and one for each of his companions   98.77825557051594
cried the brigadier   62.21684722572624
my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper   99.39621260294683
it is worth something you see to have been brought up somewhere   127.6942187752873
certainly   188.04702902373862
for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspires is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon   107.40915891490654
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages   97.28644595966254
the house had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine years   142.18558536305838
madame i have never been false to my word   140.31542795043754
at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village curé   135.56757749109843
thank him then my child in your very best manner   94.46761039330057
then i paid the host six   88.41730853498066
cried milady   90.51542724605709
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion   107.61609674179975

each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold   100.07452891643868
the first risk that dantès ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven o clock might perceive the change that had been made   21.03983424919072
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is capable   67.95816074221142
i bear the traces of our friendship three slits or slashes from your sword   112.89259953152238
no door gave entrance to the room   205.80216887857887

albert bowed to madame danglars and advanced towards madame de villefort whose lips opened as he approached   67.29908184680927
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself   114.9877496598131

what a godsend this would be for his majesty who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers   61.40509469396688
i want to go into master broussel s house captain replied friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of paris know so well how to assume when necessary   103.22061080346572
then come here   187.80872846514967
just under us   47.04991497917304
for unlike porthos who accompanied the variations of chance with songs or oaths athos when he won remained as unmoved as when he lost   228.52214954306785
this is fine   124.9460538135095
said athos useless   18.901130755335686
d artagnan s ball took off his enemy s hat   254.3667634934353
he will be found   201.14304396903592
the police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer   92.15055645977698
from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchen garden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market gardeners at a yearly rental of 500 francs   228.26380691626144
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell   96.72919775978048
well then to my health   133.3649097396121
said monte cristo   132.39601411090194
yes but in my soul much more than in my body   95.13719617493227
before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramis s ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement chevalier he said get up and don t make the least noise   130.07826889314097
fie   176.35026797713718
this peace will require a negotiator   21.65046517746171
morrel started   119.03395820291546
amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you   145.32864599710535
30133m indeed   133.08260110822852
that proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted   203.1430887159819
for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible   34.63942037993124
monsieur du vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about money   229.57216228042012
my lord said athos we are just arrived from england and our first concern is to inquire after your health   155.14804888993982
danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so   125.1937926807185
pardon me   129.34506899080463
but dress me as well as you are able only make haste   164.06166338273061
it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us   165.4260174172529
was ordered to remain at martigues   146.7528659605851
aramis awoke   201.61306255569684
i have found already   99.62730171914123
you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people   180.37214838370608
always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile   133.1815833293646
well i must mortify myself   38.96889146158671
monsieur de guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army   178.50312237884555
suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves   64.46837145633035
well yes and i had good reason to be so replied château renaud   124.85427848904409
and further that he stated to m   152.55512502226705
here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been assured   72.92496997411013
you have then been induced to alter your opinion   96.26462568499404
do they know him   186.07015377271995
they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and m   191.83104363415865
see what they have done   215.92877883137032
see said the count how very ungrateful women are   153.63615328303757
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him   94.64159955682811
he has a prisoner   193.76024125059558
two drops more would kill you replied the abbé   105.57295385812539
they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen   156.73395906319337
porthos wept   166.07074319134645
give it to me said d artagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate   93.18165166206015
it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan   119.45495097025216
i see you are coveting a good draught of it   175.0463955387532
the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres   128.09401230598723
ah   154.19092062454618
said porthos   146.03083748596308
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voiture s works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutor he is a poet a true poet   84.03691631174539
cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword   74.29272155069242
it is the same   126.9941633597424
cried d artagnan you will be shot   166.23186388655168
but instead of listening m   133.26911369483494
mousqueton grimaud and blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street   160.53519282511587
i think not sir replied m   124.77097417687747
de villefort   163.91700033107062
a daughter of henry iv   123.33538995782683
besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress   86.66971286910248
the very prosaic one of our landlord   118.31174117305069
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room   188.9241029111006
xxii   65.52574197216475
mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices   148.12978600328077
50191m the carriage stopped at the door of the house   108.81268059528836
so they have picked up the word and the insurrectionists are called frondeurs and yesterday every article sold was a la fronde   36.87686267853158
but at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken   279.2784371473345
so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner   152.44224442189915
and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses   74.43213154184986
a man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and looked   116.87695294536881
and when next day taking a fowling piece powder and shot dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude   92.55070436376641
d artagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort   199.17636591435968
i mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these   161.8624229916733
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near   116.6680166621953
meanwhile villefort and d avrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold   47.915472336085955
nevertheless let not your majesty be uneasy we will find means   109.4460746776794
yes   187.33196481493542
well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared suddenly   129.47804643174047
fine spoil captain fine spoil   152.53322214641548
let me know what crime i have committed   184.4694658750562
those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony   125.11677903347487
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing   105.19996834864703
the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed s head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself   29.38962898465411
you were asleep you are fatigued   96.20975838531359
yes yes   195.36301679494596
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d épinay   149.13209311894542
mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league distant   207.62970122484865
it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame de villefort   177.64329977600732
he does not himself know the amount of his fortune   116.90072426800354
undoubtedly said aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if i could have drawn without being recognized   139.53126276326543
it is useless to let the cardinal know   137.58715440592107
beneath these lines was written in another hand see note above nothing can be done   66.79395398947852
pray said the lackey say nothing about it monsieur   146.56152315417577
but at last the lieutenant s horse refused to go on   82.62065504486752
bigamy my dear   135.90997248384372
and they finished her off with pistol and dagger   71.98968901848869
their vows were sacred and irrevocable   92.92422877285225
inquired the young man who was in command in the chief s absence   112.20627119319613
and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of m   186.1152111419517
dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth   43.57460960886634
he extended his hand   13.207443206709428
the coachman received his master s orders and drove down the via del babuino   11.916528203953888
come with me then   184.44339034179205
so saying the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations   134.05233196363602
in the corso   59.83539406120741
no no blacas   119.54031595059713
this instant i entreat you   203.89859764883417
father your coolness makes me shudder   162.99470036833839
as he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said in a voice perfectly composed to the palais royal at full trot   56.016381950792166
to send you the chaise as soon as possible   48.90897162504342
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m   64.16312230547899
athos counseled d artagnan to dismiss the fellow   56.41631125132638
grimaud was walking before him with a lantern   122.66385586367943
bonacieux had not been abed   96.63552743725486
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord   71.26927254140644
how could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income   41.11712948340467
he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughter s name   73.40593959332969
that is right replied the mendicant   38.91697902961293
when the two musketeers had entered   0.9217521472573225
morrel said he as if he had just quitted marseilles the previous evening and had just returned from aix or toulon   153.56896038191718
yes christian and surname are the same   225.82474909519186
monday next   61.811314526807124
my orders   89.95745780662855
pray do so i delight in stories cried the cardinal   61.729777447951854
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed   91.13526862877097
will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject   71.45245582922354
stuff   203.04734868182263
this letter had been conveyed by d artagnan and had arrived in time   57.73834039358913
however the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite   75.44180214543553
the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips   191.16552077498852
the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his eminence   86.17059910576945
i thought you wished them to forget you   183.26012511863536
above the king there is god   83.88008512529046
yes continued his eminence   104.2701474744183
they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not   57.28724125950328
and do you know what has become of him   83.73882945861314
i understand and foreseeing that such might be the case i took in spite of my ignorance of affairs certain precautions   84.49634545196801
a gentleman turned around   230.56945484230377
oh i repeat it edmond   18.55984054238921
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companion s half reproachful observation on the subject   177.93039272427797
aramis shuddered   160.20368743478306
13 murmured he growing still paler   54.68391364283049
how s that   212.60617888673605
valentine whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily   95.67917093493546
look at my hat and cloak   170.69046453766495
no no make your mind satisfied on that point   21.447815208888656
royal honors to one whom they have murdered   97.48728294838548
this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day   147.8096663811491
but you forget replied debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free   57.767135247715
d avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative   206.27479961260718
yes how do you know it   53.79004209752348
i adopt all customs speak all languages   74.47807515141994
try to gain his esteem   136.52898805665484
the young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal and took his seat   110.8849696345416
bertuccio knocked the door opened and the concierge appeared   175.113329119044
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire   150.7518601865715
why he was not altogether forsaken continued caderousse for mercédès the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him   59.95949633929639
athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied we had a short discussion upon dress   80.31169144433731
m   176.56391936785957
when you see one prisoner you see all always the same thing ill fed and innocent   36.43530584918878
replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the sorbonne and the rue de l universite   119.57893556531641
he has been hanged and quartered i hope   108.72321227788741
a hundred louis   61.32125078430635
said morrel   193.25978335340488
d artagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head   118.99525871544449
and you monsieur du vallon yes you sir   128.89768202540128
de tréville crying to the rescue musketeers   1.5727830272699919
then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends   77.35516574933618
him   136.0832384618159
the young officer however remained mute and motionless   102.52671888901195
murmured d artagnan smiling as he pronounced the imprecation   101.81637961755025
which means said d artagnan who began to suspect the truth   82.8421008367581
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis   40.70496321301822
planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible   34.831550193335914
i give you my oath that i will not   166.42277356371815
he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered   80.12536051901947
germain   75.35762422308525
he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague   92.9726899460661
we are carrying too much canvas   217.71708368605005
that is impossible   153.26776523751468
i who have nothing to lose i should go   260.1642761481812
no lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of mehemet ali the sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle me   39.93900420930109
well leave them with your porter   18.943318259655854
yes   73.03898534882637
then these 1 000 francs said mercédès shuddering   33.595922095174316
on reaching la storta the point from whence rome is first visible the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of saint peter s which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable   67.16031256375298
i spoke to her once or twice at madame de morcerf s among the rest   179.06467759343587
george villiers placed himself before the glass as we have said restored the undulations to his beautiful hair which the weight of his hat had disordered twisted his mustache and his heart swelling with joy happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for he smiled upon himself with pride and hope   100.60138660213455
cried morrel almost overpowered   32.3250875590206
but beware if you and your musketeers are guilty   100.84260150905273
on the contrary everything is in the kitchen   96.24850484396961
the others withdrew   148.49462978954273
willingly my lord   150.44398293369065
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty   183.43036475542556
he was the friend of the king who honored highly as everyone knows the memory of his father henry iv   106.27920004480458
come who is my father   90.72617996854675
i understand   120.03296551671514
aramis was the next to come in and to discover athos almost insensible   93.20180039422732
not at all   155.93600239909694
bonacieux dead and d artagnan in a swoon   9.491438415870803
andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing room   64.24001040013756
i always accept   211.8746731315166
he reflected   131.79559026950386
and i shall be at the convent of jesuits   178.66554564786895
here are two other cavaliers   144.20423416793784
i am a priest resumed aramis   87.97949388983855
so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent   130.3551529213352
all this showed d artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something   75.42950762841517
sincerely madame   311.5806173048619
who goes there   116.57153433446386
they are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions   135.6447511007018
and will he aid this project   124.97673990436544
30101m this time at least i do not deserve your thanks   188.52151201499748
the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard   188.73088457564293
they are bad managers said d artagnan shrugging his shoulders   150.47165205870198
leave you   188.38403099077843
we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter for whom he seemed to have a great regard   95.82353407236874
and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness   133.0785786459758
caderousse s hands still grasped the gold and bank notes and la carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest   200.07094520029744
i have   73.69068854311257
was he liberated then   124.28809319575248
cried the sergeant   116.219384145826
said de winter   89.05588021921918
when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font madame de longueville contended no longer except as is the custom with pretty women to contend and defended herself only to surrender at last   67.64685001385813
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered   126.170382314268
no monsieur jester replied d artagnan   67.08714409650422
you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont henrietta   155.73004159067642
well i will amuse you   221.2982180266174
but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years   147.01685791128352
milady looked at her lover in silence   114.83810864364125
you are quite decided then to leave it   69.25008418560171
this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was   146.39297233706696
said d artagnan   81.39187104473422
oh by that by that i was branded indeed   71.79162454194379
so once more good night   113.87553478752285
hush   21.486797772704477
i believed it later   80.66055602203949
the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued god of vengeance   129.53423784499518
eh eh   139.1384104628676
tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced   125.91972783802463
his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze   147.4858627589654
and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse me he is inflexible he will never pardon me   157.8331465189926
albert had often heard not from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangers the description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina   157.06876306473143
humph   125.0739662343344
he then looked at the objects near him   3.971675451073395
a week ago continued madame de saint méran we went out together in the carriage after dinner   9.782865068729194
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct   91.563629603461
remain said caderousse   133.45000882402536
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant   163.06396771331111
bertuccio   88.40141670996711
he followed where they led him   172.50844395500943
dear valentine   219.03656263624953
exclaimed the queen and i will prove to them i have not left   6.477537756268859
d artagnan came the next day to milady s and finding her in a very ill humor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m   47.03042839969024
a frondeur   67.57906693842281
what ails you baron   78.68502525537556
he was charming   103.32761960397659
but if i mistake not continued he here he is   163.69899740517914
a thunder of applause saluted its appearance   200.32116914098987
approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known   97.13874094897976
bravo   132.33742018681798
i am choking   213.44001889967083
i tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle field you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons   41.65299767937677
well baron i promise you some good exercise   110.50806884049464
as you please my dear sir said the jeweller   139.35711597167625
i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo   108.48933495076933
as to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet   12.04249760877778
50282m during the perusal of this letter which informed valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother she became pale a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom and tears not the less painful because they were silent ran down her cheeks   121.7882282670841
dantès seemed full of kindness   185.67474078336926
you are a capital companion d artagnan said he   122.39891101599986
he could not endure it and sent parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king   189.1326083866263
there was an impressive silence   193.11776781985003
cried he and why does he come   199.82969996388243
oh you beautiful good little creature   217.67590724012138
it is for me to give orders here and not you   147.21896125190742
you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them   71.65437175056113
the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight   121.53779131214826
sometimes he hoped it could not be mme   54.26599418393663
you leave paris   102.23145520989041
well monseigneur replied the latter three musketeers and a guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion st   70.24041448153224
i mean active service   147.60695258922317
to the soubrette she had given the heart of a duchess   155.2750198599824
that gentleman your friend defended himself desperately   154.19446832494742
this is what has happened my brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me   254.37564952174412
and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance   98.33351578466755
8 or 1   139.51592491267638
without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it   194.58594570697056
on my honor   117.49685731357471
you have it already for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet   80.39992321477561
then d artagnan told m   206.6520879125584
athos moved toward the door   91.96879821564568
we believe like mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said athos   156.5474778453367
said porthos   138.93269413568598
cried d artagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement   272.1747253722731
in their stead d artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall   98.02865938959951
he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape   162.9556228315285
in my office or in the court if you like that is the surest place   231.68473857950235
but de winter did not call   15.739394375344943
but your excellency wished to know two things   260.175986812677
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise   71.93332148944563
if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests   158.34776290093373
well said the marquise it seems probable that by the aid of the holy alliance we shall be rid of napoleon   74.45772728611233
aramis instantly seized and read it   133.0185013558454
but my purse will be exhausted   101.85626697803647
he asked me   46.54487811638805
i will take care of mousqueton said grimaud   183.4125747572583
do you wish to go on the water sir   105.3253199907952
that may bring me bad luck   18.82959446300164
one of us would suffice   129.78116912906455
and who is the judas who has concluded this infamous bargain   23.335263366232013
six o clock   201.26175062521418
u   156.10799793055605
and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs   156.8515718059816
descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance   97.59046804000945
only at what hour was he with you   162.72283202645298
ma foi   63.84136326743715
precisely said the cardinal   108.56441875150594
it is so good that i have distanced m   148.1551925895265
it would quite cut me up   148.92828251097245
yes yes said felton   142.71222423249898
shall you never leave me again   104.43770904969998
i gave him the helm and descended   188.30344961306187
de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort   99.19200320842249
come morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage   141.9634839037743
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions   70.23698973238008
we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin   99.11268869265311
what   100.80817286593694
you tell me said franz at the moment signor pastrini was about to open his mouth that you knew luigi vampa when he was a child he is still a young man then   89.53658717856004
i have never seen her   98.59086626059316
i am sure he hasn t yet arrived   229.77765840999606
where was this window with white hangings   89.393180850684
he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abbé   146.2248331981109
caderousse awed by the superior power of the abbé sat down and wrote sir the man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon   266.57294552314625
nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him   42.18663417106298
it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself   103.92692934816704
i assure you i intend to play the devil s game to night   200.98546206504886
all hands lower the mainsail   86.01713099823831
it is an affair of importance on the service of the king   160.14798486730098
the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold   147.06001847639055
on the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in front   147.91087141010237
dispose of me then as a friend   124.78710350325528
be so good as to give me up your sword count   105.72529590776038
bonacieux and that the man was aramis   44.704020672091545
in my country the ladies do without chambermaids   122.07244036430598
i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune   109.97666800006982
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the gospel   102.94308583851966
fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome teresa   89.06067116696889
monsieur and dear friend ah yes   37.473873284132864
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution   65.4063353020191
you must go then mademoiselle said emmanuel   117.6766431181124
but added the queen in awaiting the cardinal s decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only   105.38876896134086
at half past ten   90.78805078934195
the invalid s eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable   194.11020888386543
monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you   159.22168706525682
30119m what precaution   180.36886244640755
are you alone reverend sir or have you there soldiers ready to seize me   130.36456261500342
in which the plot thickens his visit to m   132.4223595775462
maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her   129.39604124657546
why it must have been the king who made you such a present   2.944095946120626
besides we are sent here by cardinal mazarin and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal and are therefore as ambassadors able to act with impunity a thing that general oliver cromwell who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general is quite the man to understand   86.46232600122313
he resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance   202.0837402309857
i am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance   130.34931908735092
zounds   204.30269006501769
the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching him   111.24006077339011
it was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of henry iv   144.7031105581387
yes i wish to speak to him   98.28767461603566
you have befouled the face of your king   119.27205154547046
they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen   87.93957934751438
either you are a demon continued felton or the baron my benefactor my father is a monster   118.01883172974624
he first kills m   165.18392773412336
the interior of the musketeers chapter viii   177.14527630274506
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry boxes   115.35705323672977
tomorrow morning at seven o clock you will be with me will you not   168.31062342130195
thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say a throne   102.99844955829785
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m   192.60649212824146
the first to return will recover his chamber   201.39327192354216
oh tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail   108.7424284225808
i say he is a myth replied albert and never had an existence   246.49210007060736
i am he   142.68273245896796
monseigneur said m   164.30361034620807
i was born for a diplomatist   105.42462752517126
i have since learned that he was confined in the château d if and i should like to learn some particulars of his death   159.08624595099138
athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin   144.20127216841806
what has happened   128.94720047639203
comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor   88.0747895515734
i   21.764014141102777
may i ask how much he allows the young man   25.854842110451983
in fact they touched the sloop   31.642951233402584
this insolent boy chastises others cried he   219.20104357757268
these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of barrois   120.87610702952284
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes   90.23085151908069
aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively manner   116.99636707841617
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way   160.76531504056393
he put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanied by porthos returned to settle with mousqueton who naively and like the worthy steward that he was handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself   92.42562865654058
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away   168.72187174879303
the road to bayonne   95.24244809234793
well porthos follow my examples   104.51945941460394
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1   51.67727054968424
where shall i find the governor   171.97882347670904
d artagnan became pensive in his turn   43.0435073964851
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth   253.56077427223948
but it is well known what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers   90.84914196400712
bring in the monsieur d artagnan said the commissary to the guards   183.89843340205954
milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it opened   118.81761515548618
do you hear how they sleep   190.89754512010725
what what   60.49358102588254
port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by d artagnan and himself   111.91011368791561
if innocent to be set at liberty   160.53461759784645
if however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill   92.50190043289027
then would come night and with night sleep   71.28593716111733
well sire the usurper left elba on the 26th february and landed on the 1st of march   143.47256236141786
i thought you said you were the chief   203.58784404159417
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness   124.27325278065202
swear what   180.2033706021293
inquired the innkeeper   121.96038380875426
my dear d herblay   115.21111755619529
yes was the reply in a low voice   149.72678735263676
with it matters go on much better and more rapidly   112.15820234346701
do not be intimidated   16.9588635752241
at eleven o clock albert had not come back   55.57995951708412
keep the commission d artagnan   183.68182501035085
where do we sleep colonel   100.86264879009647
you are a provident person i see   21.79334002556915
what have i then done to you said felton much agitated that you should load me with such a responsibility before god and before men   172.42154454605011
remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service   177.6799844267327
he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock   79.90546163623574
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her   61.87172705399561
what s the use of mentioning that   140.83811482497245
therefore i shall not pledge myself   1.0775683649625734
who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go   35.682889845196584
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson french   50.7754588843636
why for heaven s sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark   202.10690403578695
several men rushed into the chamber   175.99600313982745
asked the poor woman have i said anything that has wounded you   83.07171962223484
oh grace grace pardon   50.325049878142266
the two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley slave   94.83256834770924
but he had too strong an adversary   178.03901401489188
but availing himself of the doctor s order the old man would not take any sustenance   134.84676604666262
d artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out   126.63909715589362
one instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridor his ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder   47.485426976703266
but we do not go far from this place   187.3578540395282
the king advanced toward madame the president with whom he was to dance and his highness monsieur with the queen   9.269103384575999
but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters   179.15536307396346
why yes very nearly   146.81359999585354
morrel i shall have his place   63.933679982261076
d avrigny which he now examined so closely   31.87143377396778
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile   81.35809095835994
de blacas we can rely on the army   31.37148660021117
the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep   162.01581849069538
for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the law made man   177.68473554097125
no   64.96039962325386
your treasure   127.87079285901468
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april 1625 the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller   104.44270508452226
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations   17.536780783858347
he will know what that means   115.66576436446056
with albert   80.81262660902632
and d artagnan who was very weary bade good night to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him   193.07131787531677
indeed   123.77138421004845
he was an honest man said d artagnan   125.03407005883989
how madame   108.81937911119294
the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not   38.85574620861833
e   161.2013881636222
well after all said d artagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris   58.16089270069827
what he   22.36189326899151
franz d épinay   150.97301829276145
madame said he i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant   162.5065068916435
i knew that from the mixture of greek words   183.3767967605446
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well   180.71675893514836
because before then we shall have carried him off   79.15241136648368
and that is true   162.32138696461124
come come tréville hold your tongue said the king   24.477618997447664
said he   169.43689562826233
then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the child s lips   84.4255160480534
said morcerf   2.713248690208374
will you not come with me   29.42190479175136
instantly   100.62401963439021
in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new born child   194.9356770057465
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place   178.08196112993153
and madame danglars will think me a very ill mannered person   132.78570354324697
his fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself   67.56230829281232
during this time madame morrel had told her son everything   216.73522706300403
i am perfectly aware of that fact answered monte cristo calmly   149.37781857086074
its agent who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of 287 500 francs i will not say granted but offered me three months   219.29364085057028
nothing good replied porthos   83.22790191994163
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs   173.39711925127557
and cheerfully would i give up five years of my pay which i am never paid by the way to make the king five years older   80.48687970395659
athos   213.3192185027661
asked the host   130.50900073429042
morrel swore to love him with all his soul   136.01902886523135
the carriage again moved on   122.9672301010957
yes   82.72725391986884
like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen   164.40892842069246
has lamoricière that ney of the south been killed   115.94415229769658
as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being used   53.43781292070276
come count you do not do that young man justice   140.67086830417136
at arles i was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to marseilles   192.22107596391754
barrois said valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you know will you open it   172.24939886839257
the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles   209.98309606922987
i would almost answer for planchet   190.48498645680877
but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust   182.55371970374716
the army marched silently the prince at the head of the column   110.62693770323797
and what did you do then   41.03533518714018
let us sell the diamond   174.26725971161227
yes i think i received a flower pot upon my head   142.39935704680227
upon my word i think he acted very generously   28.156106698392904
are you satisfied my lord   4.735304880217683
and the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn   114.15966950630485
then in addition to these concealed or public secret or open wars there were robbers mendicants huguenots wolves and scoundrels who made war upon everybody   136.38976185003912
something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne   135.5892789668548
you did well to defend the honor of a woman   85.63237630771849
let us return to your apartment   70.50514984484039
so i have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone   83.68432794712709
yes go go   45.890328166393275
as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom house officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past   9.741120748879709
now after what you told me this morning of your heart i may believe well count replied morrel gayly i will not dispute it   107.21125674963913
a quarrel and what for gentlemen   68.16968036702198
she is all powerful yonder   267.5348426396867
and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer   111.88699334619122
said madame de chevreuse hastily   237.42985461775498
replied porthos who   35.73345288249109
and are the first of men   15.351967308775826
do you hear not a single creature   104.74218473784046
by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct   151.9415203741811
mademoiselle s lady s maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly   52.17590610787276
morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude   207.4120781854661
how many have we killed of them a dozen   45.71283577924751
keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me   75.13396729037103
and i i tell you against both   214.56543472317932
i will listen   26.925678977781303
the interrogatories preceded by a minute search operated upon the persons arrested were almost always framed thus has madame bonacieux sent anything to you for her husband or any other person   97.1199423518933
place confidence in me madame   78.68165358273023
he had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke   135.43819223113096
but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed   20.92691446302861
yes   128.01272643345794
having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the count drawing out his watch said to the attentive nubian it is half past eleven o clock   172.54885332736808
château renaud recounted it at the jockey club and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister   87.94662956453307
one is weak   105.4622345529871
d artagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of a court could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception   100.44689304343584
that is the way the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma   138.8646251002157
i will break every bone in your body   50.49568729685565
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together   128.25064447410523
everything is best in its time monseigneur   181.69597824509458
that is to say the sudden disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder   89.28383527425552
the woman especially was hideous   167.94911079769244
the major s eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment   235.108888463675
come down   155.63141987131573
s   53.16438555403095
he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy   82.9607050623798
yes you re right replied the companion   177.56407706221825
will you speak   156.07044485727494
like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love   26.407535289719945
danglars retreated a step or two   95.17310596513238
when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door   195.00429390741562
they are no longer sure   129.77464181792143
deep grief was depicted on morrel s features   184.08057641481398
so he was called the queen s invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs   194.44794983843803
he stood badly with the liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists   27.83273224698243
nothing replied maximilian   96.30373560993146
all goes well in this direction   172.42231137671803
i did not seek one i did not ask for one   82.73283289560005
you are brave monsieur d artagnan continued his eminence   136.61827298523028
to my offer of liberty he replied that it was nothing but a snare and that before he came out he intended to impose his own conditions   75.19853391500553
we are listening   238.81572099711676
ah ah   217.2244243772783
submit this honour to somebody else   125.66756529099816
noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel as if to say perhaps i may   161.02038245780346
in favor of some member of your family   155.2242207987112
this he said to planchet must be the archbishop s chateau the abode of the fair madame de longueville   118.94589509758445
what wounded man   144.56867558416556
shall i tell you what you ought to do morcerf   11.431682838255355
said monte cristo extending his hand   188.33525321461823
positively these four men must be on my side   126.04428751182311
the other by buying off my judges with gold   123.58709152115352
you are the subject on which i wish to speak   101.12950927751386
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure   91.79304133981074
well said château renaud i was not wrong just now then when i said that houses had souls and faces like men and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters   109.45131196356613
now gentlemen a sortie   125.33601887580133
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed   124.87735712801522
the symptoms are marked do you see   82.01971488312418
hello grimaud   129.84936854023476
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances   156.10780916832869
the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and sausages   99.22440015047549
detach the diamonds and sell them to some jew   139.68019767513866
and if they will consent to go with you to england i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave whitehall   96.06255771687188
cried the procurator s wife raising her eyes toward heaven   21.220158635513258
very little except long live cromwell   4.041161879119784
it will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo and we can not get you ready for sea until three months after that   112.2832022607984
said porthos   72.05250884373748
you have come then at last   99.95219263310204
well said d artagnan i decide that we should adopt athos s plan and that we set off in half an hour   105.42487786911613
be assured i shall save you   243.93683705092496
the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony   83.74047753211273
finish the bottle and you will be completely so   142.9999039913365
we no longer know anyone madame   126.73929070975629
i have heard that name in greece   37.581315200564646
i have caused you to be named lieutenant   195.97821936652034
anne frowned   249.97022257504017
and all the sovereigns of the earth even cæsar borgia himself could not deprive me of this   24.873564718486165
a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal   50.33011903565486
m   138.0611302799307
salite   174.3990383384048
in a moment   29.653168397081814
again danglars bit his lips   146.66820221002675
i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money   38.267747561670205
well listen my dear aramis said d artagnan   101.89503324029913
when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue   98.09559822470176
oh my god   46.130790938663324
while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars i was reading the paper to my grandfather   45.21437498091717
20295m and what did you do with the child   97.41870841881234
now gentlemen cried the king forward   71.18349238488639
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it d artagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you   105.61789184301169
the sermon over the procurator s wife advanced toward the holy font   190.6338598015418
amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the panes   25.586225690079928
but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason   143.1528864536517
shall i tell you plainly one thing sir   143.73547650984398
i ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like you   97.48111822906395
the young princess clapped her hands   190.97498298495532
to the questions which d artagnan put concerning her health she replied bad very bad   131.77177782240827
but as after all excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable the procurator s wife had been tolerably liberal that is be it understood for a procurator s wife he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind   81.42335351269426
whom   109.56583345372474
whom are we going to attack sir   155.7401453723507
at this time athos came up to d artagnan   130.06121240958117
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois the only serving man whom he had left   117.815276096426
then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès   120.72186805860714
come let us come to the point   104.97566199089685
answered another voice which d artagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis   66.95665242875951
indeed count you are the most polished man in the world   144.35632046233758
if you forgot his features you would know him by that hand into which fell one by one the gold pieces of the merchant el kobbir   141.61426749040936
if your man is mine with one blow i shall obtain two revenges that s all   161.8109007468363
and you aramis are you of that opinion   122.75949337951374
i shall probably kill you the fourth said he to him holding out his hand to assist him to rise   63.846335636120095
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards   30.047831061150532
be seated   145.70614211664653
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit   157.48007684097806
it relates to mademoiselle marie michon   66.88035393740901
what   130.45318751234527
good   141.47034442898837
the beggar of st   134.97402570435278
over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a full length portrait of anne of austria so perfect in its resemblance that d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it   258.8722938298016
what are you about   88.88091169402304
here is the order he gave me and the cross i took from his hand   113.20168455204279
andrea assumed his gayest manner   268.06793414998253
never   66.48225847601421
could you ever have credited such a thing my dear danglars   88.39301466081841
but enough of this here is my card take it to your master   119.09554788867693
do not mistake   159.98539100910187
but the paper nowhere identifies this fernand with your father   100.99443566110776
0319m you are welcome sir most welcome   79.51526710567947
monte cristo became pale at this horrible sight   228.15337919997182
then you will dispute the more   123.59371031631962
the ball was given by the count for the particular pleasure of his daughter carmela whom he adored   111.97202738664608
we did not see her monseigneur said athos   124.55862191671278
but is this little woman then to escape his eminence   109.87743017826466
thirty strides brought them to dry land   89.11017662961657
any money   15.266070566045471
old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond   37.07250636589616
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work   140.5247683992948
you will not love even me long   226.0039513635263
all is over   70.79908607217754
30283m yes truly   228.321583208111
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal   228.0907658519268
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis   97.74414600066352
you are not angry with me   209.20557452605635
he must be enormously rich   104.91398081130949
alas monsieur said she that is too bad   93.31984535971077
exclaimed porthos opening his great wondering eyes   120.12547731485041
d artagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of porthos went straight to harrison who recognized him as having met him at cromwell s and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could   157.32086713922703
it was at this moment d artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor s carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them   103.81484711557044
no one asks for your secret all the world knows your discretion   106.99152962171814
i believe these fellows have managed their business   87.45103803722226
mme   117.27440445239266
noirtier s reason answered morrel i can readily believe it to be a good one   144.04958672317733
lucien a great event has happened   73.89007179951915
felton snatched away the knife   128.53573125725939
exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time   107.63660688540136
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo   85.26742157982054
there will be some one at hand to pick it up   201.70090421885908
she is so noble a woman   37.5221302230283
impossible said d artagnan   127.46854044674622
i fear that is true said d artagnan in a low tone   188.4954709884927
that just shows the meanness of this slander   78.51507561831363
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime   106.43819957639812
two of the studs are wanting there are only ten   146.2067784404871
i looked carefully around   158.98886803064693
which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious one   105.2784888700411

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses   85.12428241560525
you see plainly that i listen and that i am anxious to know the end   59.164623106243006
oh that s very well young man continued m   81.02979698794644
danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed it   124.02540412115135
they wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them   161.1439424549274
indeed   116.81925264586319
that same evening upon reaching his abode in the champs élysées the count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner   106.82786062459729
yes your friend at least hopes so   42.34092662753811
lord de winter was not at home   154.99476228939128
this young boarder of yours has she tried to fly   160.56153262294333
the second operation was as successful as the first la jeune amélie was in luck   182.913582032629
ah   152.67298222141017
i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger   108.01501409552407
at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened   7.876595132028811
leave the saucepan said dantès   77.11020327231296
then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which virgil attributes to his goddesses   34.62627697130033
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which d artagnan is blindly governed   181.23939286346553
said athos   112.17933424208952
on you   195.5516745839388
danglars sighed while he carved the fowl   203.3000094069966
i fancy i must have mended that skull somewhere or other   47.934165819070344
he asked   127.10168502756683
should your hand still be too weak to use this sword raoul so much the better   93.43023286970768
don t be afraid   83.54762209742702
i do not know   67.72749395909844
you intended to give me a two franc piece and see you gave me a double napoleon   109.34146580339275
in fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil   166.1840818813105
our companions will be riding horses dogs to hunt with and a fishing boat   136.9992670215589
the effect of the present revelation was stunning   90.23906800731423
how not agreed about   149.64063266768707
if it is god s justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house maximilian turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose   193.81297947864005
but madame morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper   47.735901243555205
but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle   90.88717705305262
murmured d artagnan   192.38187689176297
asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarch s life of alexander   161.7958869783349
is there anything that i can do for you   135.3999112155851
you must be tired said she to the jeweller   75.25197582672908
i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment   154.3122139240756
yes and pretty tight too i can tell you was the answer   101.15572834929074
monte cristo drew him in gently   104.63891244141608
monsieur de tréville awaits monsieur d artagnan cried a servant throwing open the door of the cabinet   152.08486872171912
but the name struck me because i also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him well   4.124389107076681
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead   166.80662632492394
the man alone submits to force   202.54730179003946
asked mazarin smiling   155.38275926740786
i will go there where i expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to l epee du grand henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty   97.30030240487459
monsieur de st   153.41926891070023
this operation proved as great a success as the first   146.96831374812513
no replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen   97.43439648891864
that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said albert you were quite correct in what you said signor pastrini   201.600689226072
noirtier made a sign that it did   120.2479679513189
good evening m   134.59952531548294
if you make a single step to find her you are lost   82.86197432744778
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil   165.55203589450002
here s a promising fellow and it is i who have found out his merits said monsieur de chavigny   150.8470423278233
yes   97.67276866843444
said he   132.92132752843415
cried franz   182.1158454340618
yes   123.0890449869987
this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste   86.29343156522127
de winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of emotion   96.43849674789212
and when do you set out   169.0482190690816
and the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold   147.68411828650443
probably said d artagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to whitehall with three of his friends   116.85589027347315
stay said beauchamp surely i am not deceived   16.375547161586937
did your excellency desire to see me   174.14369682889074
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake   124.67244806180379
50267m my friend said the count i have still one doubt are you weak enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings   131.77744957012428
what my own feeling is you already know   81.2496294954822
they bit their lips till the blood came and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might   175.78155194032584
we have plenty of time to spare   78.43749339536637
oh nothing but a scratch said d artagnan   99.76588154800889
at the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew his   73.69619335930682
monte cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent   109.5578743045759
the poor devil would eat nothing from fear   107.54279027481155
the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter   123.12617576899338
come thought danglars it is the same old story   209.04049664089393
cried athos at the end of five hundred paces   153.0432740743899
now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it   76.39953074804218
during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life   108.26902300436217
wretch   125.16294763137643
my lord said athos we are satisfied   63.29519288075919
and what do you suspect   69.07317631951126
you mean to say then my dear monsieur la ramee that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird i will continue answerable for him   203.87318012923356
mon dieu   128.40375517522517
inquired d artagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse   151.14126227053276
who is there   151.6139032563284
do you think they will grant it   28.536921598095702
this address delivered in the presence of ali who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on m   64.94698588538246
these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo of which bertuccio knows the secret   3.8486857741878993
i kiss your hands   0.6860141106039634
but first barricade the first door well   250.5794092850604
yes monsieur   177.95656714506993
yes replied porthos with a sigh it is amusing   52.915379058615834
ja   169.80991853309433
raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure   178.20170440664702
when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously   150.83558364628573
to the wall   131.4987996699095
for i begin to suffer again   156.34654431211965
who goes there   62.68064917973528
besides if they do we can easily make an excuse   34.221041280807526
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness   207.94959363743405
with more of mildness than severity   217.39368773954243
he fancies he possesses an immense treasure   84.04000129746157
athos did not move   118.4632412387838
yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saint jacques   60.21050239718138
by her step she must be young   171.90133930677237
yes sir answered raoul   151.52176207449457
why does not god if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether   101.25728910827875
by whom   110.13008893070769
the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense   162.81556533955015
if it is a snare replied d artagnan i shall scent it out be assured   20.313035624454272
less love than politics replied d artagnan with a reflective air   78.7012526311532
her ladies that is to say madame de bregy mademoiselle de beaumont madame de motteville and socratine her sister so called on account of her sense had just brought into her dressing room the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped   248.8153759378035
parry closed the door and approaching the king his face radiant with joy sire he said in a low voice do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise   121.66763522754566
he was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die   16.150372493848238
i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty eighth strip about a week ago   142.78316827606812
that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me   252.97094158164415
have you no friends in paris then monsieur porthos   203.13095579341456
yes monsieur   84.96292856787011
your eminence doesn t know those walls   109.02656823736822
yes   80.40752740882265
come m   16.42850251470132
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man i will let the count know that you are here   78.40801450696182
said d artagnan   201.30724549277178
that s true replied d artagnan   56.62205904034651
but if the queen be guilty let her tremble   48.41593206839639
oh you are good you are great my lord   130.05831045577304
thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too malcontent   141.8425047609824
chapter lxviii   24.523295808919784
raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out the spaniards   21.34313063837989
you know that it was in leaving his house that m   79.65396284489458
there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes   172.3942547153243
i suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander   58.27438681925455
oh i take everything on myself   91.81934099150739
the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man   89.22953296509976
nonsense   128.2757923384055
nothing   124.6668197327798
but we can not swim to the shore   188.3802085043664
yes   28.49224450779903
when the evening came i was so weak that every time i fainted i thanked god for i thought i was about to die   190.8611212128469
so that i fear he will never return   120.07185899989163
this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of elba   192.8524442310626
what do you mean   161.04824248026932
and both with free use of the spur arrived at st   130.00488956941433
monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word   113.05547447639331
we shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escalade   54.63033236507968
but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la réserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart   156.52209318103579
favorably or otherwise   191.4999356411828
on   264.5863706670939
d artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword   36.2819061591683
the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor   91.7116840931636
cried the king taking up tréville s words police affairs   32.234877771600054
the three friends burst into laughter   74.7046510763081
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening   64.8477930716326
thanks to the influence of m   229.47710652983062
there was a momentary pause   79.15739638744144
never mind said the coadjutor   225.41319486834382
and joy the surprise of seeing you so suddenly ah i feel as if i were going to die   78.92606787588122
count count added she you know that i wait for you   93.31350277034535
demanded he of the paralytic   120.65772168448119
how is that   49.00756673199622
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends   181.81847716822224
why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual   78.75245280176847
cavalcanti continued danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million livres   118.22953385967217
i have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it without any fault of mine i can honestly declare   164.61325106232715
do you think he died a natural death   11.83048616739751
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant you who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris   9.89785357881027
we can talk while performing that necessary task   115.84940149446673
bertuccio my steward takes me for a roman   144.23954514911037
he will never leave me   96.18251337768264
i can pass   187.55272869253236
in this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night while m   26.075282374719407
bernajoux at your service   182.99747452818337
viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you   40.3175804363331
i confess it replied albert   157.41625717526497
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his   176.26033004255854
i want to see it   122.93788878801519
about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe   76.21929666930427
if you prefer any other place said athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves   127.71620506251092
how miserable not to be free   95.18990524254481
i too could have a tilbury   131.61795316751284
take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave   17.994801877508877
repassed the bidassoa   7.666738972666607
he exclaimed   31.758892852236812
de villefort   99.01558616588419
besides although the ballet was danced the evening had scarcely begun   97.37807545649201
guilty   113.99703990440979
pray do so   93.68060117602256
to reflect   1.5653935036434916
the old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and fréjus urged dantès to try and rise   124.8590531078797
listen my dear count   44.62097861725877
there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society   76.14442794206049
and d artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket   1.866858734451739
richelieu knew that in combating england he combated buckingham   38.19789091995585
you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a rider   48.80864632470848
peppino at the same time that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou a man travelling post on the road from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente   112.99612194227501
shall i send the father to you   77.15052567324472
only we conspire against the rochellais   194.57348040998272
there   93.61830765224663
who art thou   113.66193363070464
the scotch   105.1342222554834
ah   105.12857387496203
bonacieux   109.14504917050253
he he   74.38679998553604
unhesitatingly repeated debray   110.7708183859335
yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and i would lay down my life for them   93.04919477654352
the other three exclaimed   144.21009485600388
every one according to his nature my dear d artagnan   166.09239669026175
discontented sir   76.79778071801277
what then have i to fear from him   56.44070306526632
because you think i am drunk   173.3265973850733
ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered   174.1614027880495
every revolution has its catastrophes returned m   109.25150186021435
here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain   113.09295025772778
people will come to the rescue   230.61130795888516
i   127.59711898050898
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely   178.76250691144253
falconers are declining   105.5006297450762
the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses he saw albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need   22.897404719446726
de tréville calling him back   199.46597706967827
louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance   64.60496320453146
said athos laughing   164.42114404709164
it was situated in a very private spot   109.69412073441514
he has done wonders   1.7860721826846202
well i will tell you   150.85884258408575
and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step   228.098269186825
yes sire said aramis yes you are right   72.38251037408423
there s nothing in the wake of the ship   197.32800328133993
today   119.45142953357062
milady looked around her as if in search of something   186.38437014636798
20025m the englishman smiled imperceptibly   42.98642224930889
i ought to ask your majesty s pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth   77.38804843240894
he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in mazarin s life   128.01394362646917
but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market place with stones and halberds   96.7235252080754
have you not tears in your eyes porthos   107.31088426160115
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still   5.047629248255106
may i not drink to your health and you to mine   108.02139838395742
that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship s owners would have his preference also   204.38139916577592
at first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year i became used to it   166.2007649374266
i see you require proofs   16.73596852702046
just so returned franz you have guessed it   33.22379675601809
but he did not succeed   229.54287116278238
well replied mercédès sighing go albert   194.79049360951845
it is a brawl   154.28883994393763
but suggested d artagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so well at chantilly porthos   116.19591466946103
but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind   152.92087840435556
come in come in monsieur porthos   38.38001905897984
oh   154.5874776650659
yes   142.31721348446894
asked madame de villefort eluding her husband s question   129.35988345441226
cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere   91.38543025852869
d artagnan was on guard at the louvre   47.992514668809676
well then you shall see it now   145.79555889578637
from heaven replied d artagnan shaking his head   115.45688478993458
franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting place and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui   146.97220717208606
this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing italian duets with cavalcanti   174.98293570678638
shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all   196.44674349012126
d artagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart   92.78963779408035
why how could you make such a mistake such an old stager   39.36908408262394
there is no drawing back   98.73544999245419
ah monsieur de rochefort   64.29597159683468
athos said the musketeer   24.524759036235963
no try this hare which i had killed yesterday in one of my warrens   137.3492321081773
you know it don t you   40.6982231368998
speak to your mother open your dear eyes and look on me once again   116.54112344527555
or of wisdom my dear baron or of wisdom said louis xviii   169.69878177826013
yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing   177.42393682873097
cried porthos who was breathing like a blacksmith s bellows   98.78064373478581
and what effect does he produce   3.889372661486007
do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his eminence is indisposed   48.64719346233768
but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of god s creatures since that day the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair   162.57539530200452
the war will not only be approved of but directed by the church   98.35572071038321
yes but it does not   87.18819814977036
behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps   66.29653446113164
for us also   125.83445022187769
the watchword is king and ré   180.34478161996094
and i have noticed that what   106.09172858846068
de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter   157.9428434761325
will you accompany me to the harbor maximilian   131.94814358645843
the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia   116.75863371642305
it is 40 000 francs which i now owe you said monte cristo   61.23183805264979
does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday   115.83484279255515
till tomorrow evening then   247.96616665113038
va bene   47.77664572685475
the landlord dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger had consistent with the character he had given himself judged it prudent to decamp   132.31917253439514
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son   86.04327558416774
a square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle occupied the center of the room   58.713925724275455
the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal shaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin   56.88253804487351
order them to be sought for   164.14308261228618
you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your son challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live   83.07527988455583
hullo said albert   137.68910927629378
villefort was no longer the civilized man   182.16164418656928
he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers   155.2862651430327
why do you remember when it forgets   159.08395234670326
come now what are you telling me   115.95927071700653
but if he should be a cavalier   107.00429484391726
i am dipping a biscuit in a glass of spanish wine   51.19706555369012
the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel   127.00056035869949
they reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have been   142.3018310214376
20355m scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars dear hermine i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom i little expected to see today   96.25467031080566
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced mme   137.43784098712885
madame de saint méran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m   93.38884333744704
at this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name   228.66800650954656
besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english   289.1836969772425
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto   115.50901582382312
twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next morning   175.00324423078956
nogent beautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment   120.45892676312886
he will indeed give us the favor of his company   133.64920590194976
perhaps   46.54442891059318
there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators   141.4730944390045
nevertheless he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front advancing   44.044782707799854
this time he had decided to relate all that had passed   85.26148049087934
you know how i settled the matter   22.16842357930983
no   103.74161599833707
but why must you leave me so soon   106.52840687884336
go said he in a subdued voice and find rochefort   163.62473577680487
the one you bought will then become useless to you   168.66505941460787
dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open   42.55849045053371
chapter 22   92.75884651023482
i am john francis de winter   162.73459964146542
ali returned a sign in the negative   90.29877801417463
de villefort s hands then i shall be contented   46.35907205361495
she signed a patent   154.4911409244807
ah m   39.363100646871004
exclaimed porthos in dismay   137.29362922279853
he called out his name and cried for help   152.49696663349823
her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts   164.5886737499372
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh   197.3172770435256
said the englishman i have the key of that door   69.74910042699504
yes before witnesses   148.77793763148577
i will take two poniards and give one to parry   180.446643634289
he was a simple looking lawyer s clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener   168.30665099019768
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large   95.85521267949534
i see they kept their promise   135.1089104517121
however difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished him   101.19810213497007
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner   239.6804859765504
has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands   100.14848608448186
i could not have thought that there was an englishman in all england who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom i was speaking   124.76086932278153
he stepped forward   154.56521409244164
but monte cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man sir said he in a solemn tone i consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet   169.3065753383249
one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the background   105.72186825481212
40154m then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife grinder   201.22360750662477
he was informed of it by a letter written to him by the abductor himself   120.11708183158008
cried caderousse   210.7596132503094
he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul   48.86102440781295
de wardes one of the cardinal s men a cousin of rochefort   24.017584231874608
i wish it   183.51299569960952
so you may plainly see tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked   138.0734632443503
her name was my god have pity on me   99.38534293621069
i fell upon one knee then upon both   163.61887580539454
the french ladies madame   76.11236699417945
asked athos of d artagnan   179.52353207160476
i tell you what i have been told   166.24750745675706
i have nothing but memory   169.995318693705
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done   66.13730723950826
but you will not be dead   110.68990764169351
said athos   109.30146032828961
but d artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall   36.310583897007206
my lord observes that there will be enough to go around   156.2530065530456
i saw the soldier s shape and the top of his musket   127.9260565442559
villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy dead   152.37549833780616
wake madame de villefort   38.37759721148558
i know it and i have nothing more to say   9.990055583084796
you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows   118.50806687118762
as edmond paused the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at the door   49.97160059863175
then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders   6.697138296625454
bravo   140.82301380145887
since you are here it is well   128.76392189199444
diavolo   67.86414964983842
twere better we should not be seen together   155.83325041096947
what a delicious abbé you would have made   116.40283611728395
cried d artagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the night   136.682654138889
that would be a schoolgirl s reason which i consider quite beneath me   264.8590152967492
it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m   91.49908967862643
but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her   122.75105554376478
the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited   148.60639833087433
and could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying down with mazarin as fell those at jericho   147.68276018598718
there i am ahead of you   138.04476769580307
whispered caderousse you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played   220.42477209889972
ah   88.46443153762813
de villefort said louis xviii   79.90795819492402
i may say with lucullus if i could have anticipated the honor of your visit i would have prepared for it   69.41745844563044
oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as mazarin s than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right   97.40650740521023
what has been the result   202.86101079181753
there is her husband changing his jacket for a coat   75.36218593142675
in the first place then who examined you the king s attorney his deputy or a magistrate   112.82803969491944
are we going to continue this pace all night   109.39117357341517
de villefort s pardon   137.56434213726635
oh my god   172.8152209235512
then are your names gentlemen   53.88016825422917
pray sir said villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb yourself   101.75110049538543
then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress   63.82115736398674
d artagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous   186.8860758151921
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you   220.12169094328857
at the cries of m   208.443359117268
but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world   74.30795619069993
asked porthos   77.54929461290769
franz de quesnel baron d épinay   104.46020487145506
explain my child he said explain my child he said explain where did you find this purse   216.32947907277259
the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient and locked the door was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the king s attorney   222.18107059559696
the road to picardy   115.17865215169095
one of my friends one of my friends please to observe not myself said athos interrupting himself with a melancholy smile one of the counts of my province that is to say of berry noble as a dandolo or a montmorency at twenty five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen beautiful as fancy can paint   21.89431993103571
mme   29.403731962729267
lord de winter did the same   137.89534605843517
athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr king   162.26390155763823
i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it   89.0247044760202
i am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible   104.77609063197289
then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife   138.42706110294532
another nod on the part of grimaud   131.07613297937834
it will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the neck   127.7116795773807
he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need of me just now   6.2399415361786055
if you had been a man you would not have let him go from here   9.586103821822306
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort   151.04546538645533
i shall be a bad judge in such a case   7.714545590367564
he belongs to the fronde and you to the queen of england   61.53664232723439
no maximilian i am not offended answered she but do you not see what a poor helpless being i am almost a stranger and an outcast in my father s house where even he is seldom seen   3.0929512680056774
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton   117.81397058291131
my clerks are honest men who earn my fortune whom i pay much below their deserts if i may value them according to what they bring in   86.60536642090736
all the world was ignorant of it   115.4159339955299
yes i fear   97.18530487970598
i hate them   109.18710349410793
felton i dare not tell you at what idea i smiled   149.882835528429
he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection   134.81698994609263
i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends   96.94644845289466
i have heard talk of him   192.0869875180934
besides the end justified the means as you frenchmen say does it not   165.1696286144747
i had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or musketeers   108.09643662829185
monte cristo approached the window and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight   41.53557509641735
i say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resistance   98.12667171799038
no   78.30606845753172
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch patrol   211.44533207690122
a deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to paris   238.37077596727144
but one   173.28846177247016
by degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his course   192.541960566351
so much the better young man   179.84781296750828
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they can not or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks   129.10837996432844
for after all who procured for me who had never seen either you or your illustrious father the pleasure of your acquaintance   39.29016848193571
and where shall i find you   86.42378816533693
i swear it by our god   102.22457765151111
eugénie has left us   158.34370730519618
which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen   60.694490397418164
not the least in the world   95.9679625418709
what weapons   95.85650260619764
on the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious   176.81138561532921
in a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits   115.06687369648004
debray colored slightly and followed with his eyes the direction of beauchamp s glance   113.43650340587926
at this precise time the first gendarme andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door   73.05339057215407
you are certainly going mad   22.128394530650297
one of the persons whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house   188.11723819355285
i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money today   232.82566269884552
and by doing so monsieur the governor said d artagnan you will deserve well of the cardinal   229.3309285180792
do you talk of a sacrifice   206.73494848303682
aramis colored imperceptibly   78.16664920975967
from an apoplectic stroke   67.58497271766848
oh they have a house to themselves   181.40474939974064
beauchamp one of the kings of the press and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere was eying everybody through his monocle   123.72161332453007
oh m   95.38435817222012
cried scarron i should compromise you too much   3.9782350499922643
your song is as dismal as a de profundis   266.5295428939746
certainly not   194.90838560429904
a last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them   22.17977805968016
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never   240.5267769213648
take   106.64191853794796
said he to the host   126.62229135106605
he arrived   109.60067718620441
there only they explained to them the matter in hand   67.12675408781108
this diamond was to have been shared among his friends   47.82959474249907
the gratitude of anne of austria   110.71893398060132
well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with d artagnan porthos and possibly even raoul   81.26741403722629
my sole heir that i have bu   133.7670330924171
of course you stopped at your father s   164.11466549782205
no my lord   61.0907535613315
by the governor s orders said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath   46.96550066170896
from the queen   195.04292038973182
i can not explain myself   72.65483421568312
the pope awaited him   110.59866932592584
that the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could see   247.24154012620087
asked the abbé   136.69571454764258
well how much for the equipments   79.96731300657979
cried porthos   233.62225091632502
occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event   95.80612276966085
and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to me   176.50279587514314
in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them   70.38517600161516
cried a third   54.740382382169045
alas said she i did all for the best   140.80057389805614
he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one   59.691323899026834
charming   145.6270718787315
in truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers   147.740378943556
release broussel from prison and give him back to the people   115.84463323840181
lend me your back but don t let the cardinal go   173.82018019601958
well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you   111.11742766546043
eh then what are the sentinels about   160.5492627467268
no no continued d artagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman   243.6468210863057
besides has she not yes sir said the major she has 30127m paid the last debt of nature   38.599786646000496
your courage can not be doubted   30.758630742305
i draw upon him for 600 000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400 000 francs payable at his correspondent s in paris at the end of this month   45.713445955824426
perhaps she is pretty   119.5922997958075
mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door   88.03079079233922
for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred   120.92781996735665
only three days since we looked on him as our best friend   82.59543034151407
i will write to him then nearly in these terms   173.1894976404637
on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk   90.80013031521655
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken   178.03113976312545
ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment   274.96187416539084
that s correct said the captain   60.11910404675966
de tréville was not at his hôtel   62.537027623447074
i desire but one thing in this world edmond the happiness of my son   118.50562312573025
cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m   148.76800575423178
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives   151.05234033372398
well   113.79983267017066
the rest ordines inferiores of the ecclesiastical hierarchy bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels   207.6413091206762
oh yes   104.03492008675207
m   124.01273274683842
40298m yes indeed sir continued eugénie still quite calm   167.98591773746432
employ me in any other way   138.1988451864221
the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues   212.1651846076071
for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven   230.27560301700947
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy   138.17910389035652
he was as this remark shows a man full of philanthropy and in every way fit for his office   133.95994700933431
i will return home instantly   156.87664728142852
designs by decamp as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa but more poetic   102.24942527266471
our former life has it still no attractions for you   178.17732525597472
cried d artagnan which well becomes good citizens like us   118.27058244326295
planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same   225.86808341217505
they are the spoils of victory   145.8037056659153
no boat   141.4694679523678
he approached her   85.35697845340275
we were in a place where it was not very cold replied porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him   169.7934050394464
yes   74.24012664273772
cried the stupefied musketeer   177.8211797732804
he had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy   217.73919014636527
i know your devotion to her majesty   125.69083043219274
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily   101.45852491199223
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo   98.57085034567912
said danglars laughing in his turn   193.56737670077774
at ten o clock the king s collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st   173.37701404452912
with whom are you going to fight   109.22158706653488
the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper   120.67938349292447
repeated the king   175.13147230926677
debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie   40.70004721446834
the shade of cardinal richelieu   89.81661332421857
gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one   181.79306099567918
he was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis   96.87666268567651
and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me i hope   67.45234819627746
ah if you command me that s another thing said bicarat   15.925978704866338
that completes the 250 000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains   176.2725384286041
a trade   103.13415294082627
spare me then i beseech you   71.42305511064716
and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth and grasped the old man s senseless hand   136.87842786057246
de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine well grown girl   163.68393375294937
still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of   152.8276259037786
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne   47.59856902973705
should the ransom be refused the prisoner is irrevocably lost   140.22963747780986
valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m   104.84146694526461
is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites   140.70209449002945
the comte de la fere lodges in the rue guenegaud hotel du grand roi charlemagne   111.83831497743984
you are about to become captain at nineteen an elevated post   163.169266239806
villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words   24.934510996741352
yes monsieur replied d artagnan   89.4929075065919
the plan is his own   164.83110184657517
ah you begin to awaken my regret   70.39942079297407
i have forgotten the other key   131.3933067119762
lack a day   147.47793883194925
thought the dying man   206.75081027598975
therefore he must have made 300 000 livres   170.56402093532026
but you can not break it off in this way   76.48111957710307
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly   114.41433382992695
andrea cavalcanti or rather m   11.491602522242573
ho   166.57878182382441
and whither am i to go   61.9764199560693
so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me   177.54224854082196
then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god   105.55343486879131
chapter xxxix   52.16016573336417
monsieur said athos i have engaged two of my friends as seconds   16.986848482562635
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m   49.51860943430508
if i were a frondeur said d artagnan i should knock here and should be sure of a good supper   183.81046998349115
horror   162.01603861068241
oh sir twenty five years   156.10105662098755
but a confession made to the judges a confession made at the last moment extorted when the crime can not be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty   99.7388649382878
ah   106.76738768589121
let us go then   211.12598322312442
oh murmured the young girl   45.235214352598575
certainly   133.00093680008644
then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist   146.87996424077627
the papers had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galley slave   136.46895484157082
idiot   92.32507962980053
herself   213.00926934924888
oh we can scarcely say   68.62430641233006
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself   134.68467874039303
she extended her hands to him with a smile   243.12342663912779
are you hungry   74.35530800695793
accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis   13.802704520557683
i purchased mine at constantinople   167.42813566344793
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science   86.66611328429707
but among enemies it would be only a stratagem   71.41769682929917
he began his day by breakfasting substantially a bad beginning when one wants to employ the head but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body   51.34178869087654
ah perbacco indispensable were they   73.09035749410812
are there then two parliaments   40.92223808656182
half an hour after the entrance of the king fresh acclamations were heard   81.77910796764154
his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed   133.87707272484715
but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths   155.9294909881681
he listened to know whence this sound could proceed   110.684653387557
and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his band   49.027808903425935
i said they would skin me thought danglars   116.59294687574219
there was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti   211.59150655383922
and the guide went out   101.57724632587652
without further explanation d artagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the richelieu gate   86.03061632289783
it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings   109.8789409095683
patience patience   0.39559344860380463
yes   123.11076962641948
and what did the doctor answer   162.89595532920978
a tailor who never disappoints you   102.79114323451711
give me drink said he i thirst i burn   21.383567152593386
for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation   238.07924253899628
i have remarked also another thing said athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched   178.95103457242976
and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers   128.4222010361431
hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself   112.460421040426
said porthos   107.98244303086265
said danglars he is not one yet   172.34193728586965
then it is danglars   17.043782281423958
danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker   64.67422269159864
at last one day when for the hundredth time i took up my spade i asked myself again and again what the corsican could have done with the child   104.45927038486606
three nights   92.99811387605075
still the death of one old man always considerably affects another   103.69123421168119
but said d artagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal   139.04686143234636
bertuccio and to a king s attorney at that   140.52059205463712
if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe   106.26647486295903
gentlemen resumed aramis any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have had you arrested for we have friends in paris but we are contented with another course   121.5986896599979
said the pilot in bad french   55.302538977897285
you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough   108.53139855803418
not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me 4 000 piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than 24 000 livres of our money a sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country   203.7919867202711
asked the cardinal with a certain degree of anxiety   99.42992897902067
and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow   156.5442660421178
they both stood in amazement at the door   147.221968113256
from day to day he lived on alone and more and more solitary   20.444632461907958
d artagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeer s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it   201.80738439703867
scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants   66.7143281043191
but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice   148.4999109835484
but there was no look calculated to reassure her   121.32657907470373
i will do mine elsewhere   20.132385719942462
why so   38.865744664888894
noirtier you killed my father   61.75735676301102
zaccone   143.64204113894655
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo   78.94862664884504
the morning dawned dull and gloomy and villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink   88.35193549267389
and what have master pastrycooks to do with us   98.96951905919016
dantès did not answer   163.10628973277386
his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern   83.88006420677259
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an avenger   153.21952527340056
i got such a fright last night replied dantès smiling that i have almost lost my memory   114.70888055837052
meanwhile albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying florentin is your horse fit to return immediately   99.11209808664734
but in case i feel disposed give me some particulars of today s executions   172.5397503597836
he was a man of twenty five or twenty six years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates   116.87931316623269
it is excellent advice   46.294592310638095
athos smiled with ineffable pleasure   0.02639609195135506
cried the owner greatly delighted   70.58095681785196
certainly replied the jesuit a little put out while the curate greatly delighted turned upon d artagnan a look full of gratitude   122.73564673706724
you permit me to tell you that i do that is already more happiness than i dared to hope   115.61167941810173
have you enemies then   142.36851392105845
apropos my lord   123.72145600677278
if monsieur aramis hesitates to come he said tell him i am from tours   71.8144811455258
madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunes it is a punishment   208.27471738272362
said caderousse   167.68908110678586
bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description   27.45916540716354
what do you mean aramis   94.81872180178195
does madame de morcerf dance   203.5858631153839
de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal   214.3717366822765
she returned to consciousness   120.15479876922569
the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment   203.6616876829509
do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to sunday morning   82.18605422125697
exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french   87.35403837644245
what is he waiting for   103.87180798576054
comminges smiled   78.39497811014613
madame de villefort is dressed   145.62495051234288
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness   100.66586305992959
ma foi said monte cristo rubbing his elbow it s all your servant s fault   24.344379304773838
ck from the small creek to the east in a right line   228.96960179386576
or sully louis xiii   141.2122311072418
this oath was no longer a vain menace   108.01833300810648
but peppino did not even belong to my band   128.01331848220738
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp   92.2825309397598
every one arose   120.12676356128543
where is fernand   125.31094480222481
oh you are beautiful always beautiful   180.01761994877808
it is he   165.9105170011775
just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon   113.39236545586836
i will call thee mouston   28.376712042910484
monsieur d artagnan promised me his assistance   138.25837328275466
i told you we were informed beforehand   151.45153278374357
cried the king in the highest state of choler   22.344686983063625
oh nothing more easy   251.29428173972113
madame said athos when must we set out   32.24614598750064
no he will not desert said the king   113.63178053962078
for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides   28.909056862144823
you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation   43.48894929070086
and now gentlemen that s well continued the cardinal   188.22912797091624
i had been tracked by a customs officer who had lost sight of me near the tavern   89.6247281870502
i believe he has not a franc in his possession   247.52073352135213
i have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend   207.3727017055784
god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space   50.060965745288726
i can not bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all know poor franz d épinay   20.194974217566383
these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused   12.985690532005975
we are near athos s door   169.8309687410347
since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room   142.7168014138884
then dantès departed for genoa   79.86547551438295
chapter xxxviii   73.5008575082567
everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow   171.9193850245592
nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own   87.06775799272224
said she   178.39356806064708
all villefort s influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dantès had so nearly divulged   150.5661819952713
the deuce   62.12311459701388
but as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing rooms   140.0210863689739
they had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries   120.99687404001298
inquired eugénie   100.02651222249006
ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence   224.8149415447405
replied the marquis let us lose no time then   49.92938324844695
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour   109.5064065767064
how do you know i was praying sir   97.12696085278608
i knew that said monte cristo   218.89779047842822
but at the name of milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents   89.20898341358152
they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop   165.08922074715926
of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg™ name associated with the work   49.3771918473756
to prevent recognition said d artagnan   181.62450879830996
these words gave great joy to d artagnan   68.38536828324234
ah indeed   110.22164689273481
alas alas   39.5817139574296
why you were drunk   114.20721831092062
come my dear albert said debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes and that like madame de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story   147.60954984658704
cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep monsieur d artagnan   18.470061875795594
he rose gave his seat to m   121.37100565574329
albert advanced towards eugénie smiling   198.31955559165638
the count fancied that he was yielding and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the château d if   162.57454775103344
org   107.69552410384804
just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn   118.564548471358
but you have the first claim m   62.544252974037654
i want to be convinced   102.79204677888227
how d artagnan and porthos earned by selling straw   249.74166620363266
there is no doubt of that   118.01785708855793
i should find myself therefore more at my ease facilius natans in a subject of my own choice which would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to metaphysics in philosophy   182.98394330330828
villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others   158.87436219278482
well then i must be contented to imagine it   288.8344419129574
d artagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him   58.37311542061451
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood   160.29459302191964
come my dear bazin tell me where he is   123.72875870193845
general i wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me   54.028238682561906
the count smiled bitterly   91.55823915034426
why this very morning in my rooms he made his entrée amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement not even excepting château renaud   39.079770679495454
at a league from beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud   20.098757776320284
after a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming vigorously   55.663845736977535
i ate some bread and some fruit   125.56569548753598
athos appeared   74.97123604427046
my intention was to inform monsieur laporte through my husband in order that monsieur laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself there   2.823394760602966
but now he said that you are a widower your wife s connection can not injure you   46.73414045957486

she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him   143.80578848582766
he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do   107.108461967972
that s it said the cardinal that s it   203.2671210648224
said d artagnan   173.6381967498902
said morrel when he was alone with the count   192.9085248567159
a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him   141.55793525593128
monsieur the cardinal   173.094772502184
said he   192.18783512210405
i hope you have a sword at home   76.1675060863025
i shall always love you   42.09449458909057
the king called the cardinal   136.9361812696293
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms   155.69829231901116
an old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hands   177.3106612879036

it was you who when this rival had discovered your infamous secret wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins whom you sent in pursuit of him   118.76675379116669
what are you bringing me   168.10366786699217
asked the prefect   140.01667282131405
asked the two gendarmes   175.3501969017697
here i am sir   160.16181786987113
i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance   154.6791581710612
it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened   64.22668686002638
we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome   136.94464902062987
monsieur cried dantès i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity   113.24018197331527
well then a happy and merry life to you   66.23920834210377
but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention   103.51087886614059
albert s lips scarcely whispered good bye but his look was more explicit   26.785977921139377
and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence seemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future   165.91390260384267
amongst the catalans mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any   170.60430420081673

madame   82.19926502769334
do you want me to go away   211.0152957352421
brother in law of the late king your husband the consort of madame henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr   175.25687660544827
i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase   60.39907925875892
come in said the officer   12.435274733137135
what can he be looking for   128.0348949131366
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand   157.29493225311703
forty thousand francs income i think you said   187.37044168433005
and what am i to pay with brute   131.66937091835973
but i sent the ring i had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted   142.69681053935008
the carriage was upset the horses carried off stifled mangled by the crowd   185.9305824615295
and do you understand them   173.16292604591857
it is long since we have had a good dinner   90.2126717397555
they turned round and saw diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his arms   143.32581747464423
he then gave his friends minute directions as to their route   184.06161397952513
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister   159.65697626886248

towns fled from them like shadows on their path and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once reached   42.86346713211897
porthos devoured d artagnan with wondering eyes   61.003473879961305
my god i am lost   129.5340826671187
at dinnertime we will rouse you   103.17587852072577
my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed   105.25781032151717
a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long athos will act   130.8291090269311
indeed they are not   120.89309014176638
they passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open country   77.9521035859429
i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others   53.37610138883098
i thank thee i thank thee   150.78555593739355
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told   49.6675683541947
athos   158.81807837641534
it s little enough   73.39020617583935
i know it said château renaud   111.45003857498106
dandré is not a man to be accused of treason   129.24767484901193
dantès sighed   187.56540122709853
25 the spahis are french cavalry reserved for service in africa   92.64009419707253
is not death in my house   153.34976648249466
better if i drink   145.66188920945623
because your strength is not in your head porthos said his friend   147.0761775044952
i had a plan   160.5438892885674
however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover   28.304877657155814
i say you wished to avenge yourself on me and i say that it is horrible   95.1017294717655
in that case they have eaten everything   260.44136279872305
what was the cause of your quarrel   212.62809812333577
but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry   193.43357413039905
the queen is too virtuous   16.916961927965488
for france   201.95526720416808
i will watch over them as i have over you   191.80385057324335
but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king   139.80098908317674
said a low voice   141.52336175267908
de tréville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you   138.07533686157825
the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue férou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abbé busoni were within   196.97540398533704
it was cold and motionless   136.29736872590098
d artagnan and the englishman chapter xxxi   21.29829687486496
athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read dec   119.63864859359087

there was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house   47.92543213794927
i beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but i believe you made a mistake   59.878583110648364
ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind   162.99256467585883
on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable wife   167.56401333100308
listen   19.75969744329052
said the officer everything is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house   139.3823350784757
the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside   106.2610491151485
can he be seen without doing so   147.64936664356674
you are of my opinion are you not viscount   155.78409148528698
athos you make me shudder   178.41708965965043
asked madeleine   58.66892400008629
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled   48.6644642868244
i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin   180.4559609022844
the idea came over my mind and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance   132.73612978298564
the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased   79.94543009930955
yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone   118.86358434634997
you are right planchet said athos   270.7429002271746
and to you also m   73.69559647144855
but the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow   188.81947028674156
go ahead my friend said athos   68.33006352836088
what that which brings you home to me   114.33097531804823
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in silence   171.18715049672318
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber   172.74191463562568
i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at rome   64.08488326819904
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword   195.02795194377518
but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings   132.12640539758053
where are these papers then   140.37705918023212
no not me but a young corsican my companion   147.85546363034013
monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness   166.65428228297628
the festa was magnificent   143.5563941598098
three months passed away   100.44120861026173
but this last circumstance was not striking as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much   38.070636572937644
morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles   135.3872619548167
said monte cristo smiling   177.32030809298462
exclaimed morrel   158.07291962829007
the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed   49.13354274013503
of course we do replied albert   90.70268604250396
i am told it is so very amusing   60.060608127889985
said he   191.95668186590697
said porthos   139.395008002407
said he in a low voice   125.03553649192978
the story begins in 1815   90.0591209231879
the jailer brought him his breakfast   130.18094042046746
and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished   62.33253904803223
they saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned   204.28061086307534
he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent   102.41438110495274
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy   214.025567394287
poison death   99.01947626481993
it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease m   142.18070776647443
moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper   34.83134301089561
rest assured cried the duchess i shall do what i can   141.72337581628182
she screamed aloud   158.54398223246932
yes he continued sadly shaking his head yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us   141.64810553623624
but d artagnan was still in a desponding mood   20.013364659602857
i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twenty two years ago you know   185.3920573807901
then ringing the bell once look   171.0777884192267
you are now master of england   121.43157605210098
the young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of lucia di lammermoor supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy   99.87250036593704
my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not intoxicated   80.05123268205463
but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive   202.40866732219013
my position is not sufficiently elevated for that   114.41538121354226
but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages   196.15826294529728
at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio   180.6151961714044
and the door keeper appearing called out with that shrill voice peculiar to his order ever since the days of beaumarchais the court gentlemen   75.40415988606637
the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard   104.05294447180815
i would arrest ten of them ventrebleu a hundred even all the company and i would not allow a whisper   87.58689224040785
be satisfied replied felton   162.31845354131482
asked aramis   165.4769672407989
what would you have   109.20747358274855
well one can never say what may happen   122.96114214379847
eh sir   142.76172323030545
the walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid   258.71653636691485
i shall return immediately   92.82893173693563
his coat looks nearly new and his boots are brilliant   14.420574534218076
f   0.2951439607383861
said valentine   84.79482674800695
he hastened with franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner   114.3239667118091
and faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the apartment   182.76984291035626
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal 100 000 francs which i spent in four or five months   60.01435947882258
and d artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal louis and rocroy   203.77733731951028
and although her underlip like that of all princes of the house of austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt   185.64553181745265
he desired they should be returned to the queen   125.14520443091469
aramis my good friend this time you are wrong interrupted porthos   73.27628839654591
he was told my lord will pardon me certainly speak   133.16968794855907
it is true nevertheless   144.40325189001987
and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal   150.3039198029613
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket   16.808033704795065
he then said something in arabic to ali who made a sign of obedience and withdrew but not to any distance   170.1329255243122
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fère all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said   197.7545042984035
noirtier   119.96597439917515
cried the young man whose agony drawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble   107.48886909124019
has no one owned him   72.7440713739101
de saint méran s   116.64882574679967
we have a rendezvous you remember at the place royale   66.42197175343114
coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good housewife   94.44173190105833
at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken   62.377985056384524
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room   97.18339860131444
go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister de longueville that i thank her for the present that she made me of you   133.61658805848805
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count   149.2348819915573
about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner   94.69279284185446
well well   93.04433833556239
and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss   348.00212407068517
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight   179.81642741358735
but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dantès i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end   261.6122236219356
the parliament condemned charles to death as might have been foreseen   176.63655924648714
but if you love me as much as you say replied d artagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account   110.35497654925548
grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time   134.0117707966041
if his eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my musketeers said tréville the justice of monsieur the cardinal is so well known that i demand an inquiry   237.63454381776182
i recollect now   48.99036192445109
half the 15th of this month half the 15th of next   93.51740467058033
or rather take horse and ride immediately yourself   131.63970996378777
ali cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong   97.57051037137771
ah   60.213171766923075
but as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief he should have been louis xiii   164.93062080635002
then i have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees   247.94382685730756
if we are attacked we will defend ourselves   200.87463985038306
yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq héron   172.94278646511685
de tréville chapter iii   216.1575705813549
yes said the old man   163.989425478995
who and where is he   14.481785675997571
no said morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my enemies   107.28549753930079
inform him that it is his turn to sign cried danglars to one of the floorkeepers   87.18708214959744
your excellency lodges at pastrini s hotel   110.88844729364502
what is that   67.80303787691253
mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd   109.31022766138946
are the half of the sum mother   144.56699541349406
sir unless you force me i think i can effectually force you   45.28568145854243
the laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark   24.782653875986185
it is useless   118.37731725640413
i depend on you   164.3729837103271
danglars then opened the window   209.41627996104177
it is of an original color said aramis   178.03196976551882
and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family   115.9898870776212
rue de la fontaine   105.0585094891939
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read albert s letter   106.71940072924151
you are mistaken   142.769284078549
he has grown a good deal it seems to me   161.00355820586282
cried the gascon do you think athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and aramis   160.77840176399107
the night lamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimney piece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned   220.87997631548126
and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard   183.26409063181256
i was not willing to fly   167.50729367057048
his misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance   32.43444999695562
is that she mamma   207.0003043016946
aramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest as they quarreled formerly over the musketeer   88.20394791296559
hey   12.339296928984197
you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love   165.4038964911015
oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me   124.67566119370414
listen to me he said or rather look upon me   96.9946265338853
it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen   142.18461846938558
free to leave me   127.22839815645122
he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and re enter by the porta san giovanni   107.90083582289242
no it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you and believe me i take no heed of such dreams   125.12876253659714
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up   178.82815000804067
oh blind self love   17.377378045185566
i have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer   226.47133593696572
do you know what those three windows were worth   41.15909919518592
we have a fixed price for all our provisions   109.51924586902574
it was then half past six   125.83554752237039
madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you   110.66641178272863
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend   55.728282944300915
these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which m   107.00596248151628
take care my young friend   153.9478793020565
yes much said d artagnan who did not well know how to answer   48.96068265917481
it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death   66.30179675933317
you have done this i hope so at least   161.62086563364826
villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement   114.32926596257076
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too   125.43145081712136
why how can you manage to do so   181.84553570117765
the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain   60.690747577251656
no you have not   79.10382741265069
he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one   86.03200300230675
both are easily excited but they quiet down immediately   71.64857383187068
for third rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it   120.10619707616901
disarm him only make sure of his sword   132.29057797510006
no your holiness i take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor   104.41460576797755
asked mazarin anxiously   132.21584495417054
this arrangement pleased every one   135.46794914730242
and sir continued the wounded man i suffer much and would like if possible to be carried to some house   113.4095591918733
you are mistaken my friend replied the abbé   216.15570029728724
the captain of the king s musketeers   55.35986010775391
for your example has given me at the same time hope and courage   175.67722086493592
i am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean   77.87334833928182
eleven o clock had struck   31.068201310287904
de tréville   70.41025944948224
later said athos   139.18573763100903
and once more he bowed low before his highness   137.68307709335227
impossible   132.94863033780257
is my mother ill   154.33741940743732
but you know guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage   72.11248527227367
asked mazarin after a moment s silence   122.53168919048312
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me   108.6884583281279
but how could you have these fish brought to france   179.6168509668498
the mistress of that fellow d artagnan   188.50578888235572
said danglars   188.8683989656929
come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you   49.252160936016324
there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets   214.90606742997812
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence   58.67470225124948
is this the man   105.99175513308481
very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day   240.55868962590216
you are afraid planchet   227.4752317970886
yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my arthur thou art a fond and faithful creature   159.29303543376506
you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural means   204.80533344484394
morrel smiled   180.34623900999821
franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows   132.38619144077006
monsieur le vicomte knows that i never joke   28.053219476504808
in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred   84.28712530834797
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances   16.23377913743849
can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties   136.34372849187125
how so   217.50413229965193
happen to be hungry that s pretty good when i haven t eaten for twenty four hours   111.27545628654916
20139m under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance   62.200218091934836
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle   74.94478444233461
your pardon m   177.7375769148202
good morning creditor said he   192.33802147245973
oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing   156.57692437031758
and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols   171.763760354608
aramis wounded as he was seized the mane of his horse which carried him on with the others   138.9121895546898
yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly   61.13995718133403
that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink   95.4685582441401
we have an instance here   201.24419106427285
sure of himself convinced of his own power certain that the laws which rule other men could not reach him he went straight to the object he aimed at even were this object so elevated and so dazzling that it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated it   135.59968478872742
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them   118.43626356302725
it carries me away   137.15218089830708
but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows   74.48379871929166
he fell back cursing with rage   224.74603167888512
allow me then sire to intercede for her with your majesty   98.14876488889449
noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter s room and watched her with his paternal tenderness   128.3773855306077
cried the unhappy young man if you doubt me question me   64.77351189819969
then who reigns in france at this moment napoleon ii   88.69608680890435
d artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward   5.154262760231475
that he was leaving at the same time as his letter   144.98741413020778
upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead   60.276838393690795
a great misfortune more important to me than life   148.26919140312197
in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers   94.79832428418621
i know it that is sufficient   153.5501769281941
did you remark that man who is following us   40.086876635295454
he struck his forehead on the ground and groaned   167.584432757
he threw himself upon it and fell asleep   131.66110394791633
those guides are nothing but spies and might possibly recognize you   161.87636431426915
you know well that we go to breakfast there   113.87979112681408
you still confide then in sinbad the sailor   30.271922366912804
he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot   117.0339878974481
albert said beauchamp with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and talk   142.6229264146782
but really said d artagnan   218.6878847108606
the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead   108.15233087485011

just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation   14.925288630498386
dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about him   116.3578037680459
the young girl made a gesture of rage   119.37231071503197

as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his peas   137.64579311879035
he spent fourteen years to arrive at that muttered the count   149.39562618022575

these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation   30.05419604694943
but on rising from his bed of justice on the twenty eighth of june he felt himself attacked by fever   100.41897946944005
let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts   24.46509472183898
i can not speak latin responded the marquise   164.49178844462276

pardieu   161.2464533337782
said porthos placing a finger on his lips   115.81597495599965
but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife   73.4633997001853

there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy   119.89272481796124
it is a demand that porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds   109.83298081938912
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you   0.17078438755912373
but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy   154.11276111668892

madame danglars and eugénie were going out at that moment   85.98669684987875
aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached d artagnan   101.92396185758139
but first give me this letter   102.10954603263346
on arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital   137.19201371850212
bicarat was a gascon as d artagnan was   41.60912853940394
upon my word you would make caesar afraid   103.7126020510502
but here the wound reopens and the heart again thirsts for vengeance   106.9411161468878
he is very susceptible   224.4430886104695
well then instead of pitying me you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your mistress   150.2442024851651
cama the pilot of the saint ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales   135.86261002914898
he could not breathe   73.9762850490657
cried the lieutenant   153.65855609998977
it is over now and i am much better   126.23133093423486
and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him   169.30720981050698
i swear to you monsieur commissary that you are in the profoundest error that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done   138.44357721592613

he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that i see you nothing more   98.04579482217406
i know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myself it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice and i must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god   14.243981571783877
let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing   100.03566625218184
you are an amiable and charming young man said mme   161.36297206254028
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him   113.94596202745213
speak to him yourself for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest the duc de beaufort this officer and i have been on bad terms   129.4307097096287

the doctor left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it and going up to noirtier said abruptly how do you find yourself   144.9705136075729
how sir   160.09520429168262
but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent   157.85785188906576
now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery   56.535912966989635
ma foi said monte cristo   187.27212164157157
i had left bearn when it arrived and i never received it until the month of april 1647   160.22488534221398

sacrebleu   103.89804676360808
exclaimed porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach   37.286243065792846
if these five men give themselves up we gag them   117.27311734912084
yes repeated the executioner   118.98397937889045

no sir he is not with us   83.39039500006506
the two friends mounted as did their servants   187.5703615850959
said eugénie   26.16625910580595
woe he cried to those who confined me in that wretched prison   48.08734253502318
i never ceased to search and to inquire   124.49854469120812
to this athos replied quietly we also have money left for i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs   70.17072989043814
ho there my friend   158.65085454276823

many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the foot of st   139.91345067170374

she said that the cardinal de richelieu had drawn the duke of buckingham to paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen   133.48534146776802
if you die my lord i will die with you   125.20237696908457

he sent them two excellent horses and the fugitives went out hastily from tours shaping their course toward spain trembling at the least noise following unfrequented roads and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn   51.22223409826064
well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another   136.49008659370867
why   126.81111264532055
i wish i were on board already and he looked back again   215.57536908922742
but if you think the king s life is not worth what it must cost there s an end of the matter and i send to groslow to say i am ill   190.43498918294708
this look told him all and his anger waxed hot   207.25909059604865
during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali   148.70153898284659

rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the church his costume being similar to that of the abbés in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet   74.491547483929
and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased   145.70362338099073
my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified d hozier and jaucourt   99.17419656901721
maximilian morrel said she   127.59405384520926
yes but answered la ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes can t be sent around a ball like a letter   125.62622874993878
what do you think d artagnan   113.72739525543398
meddle with your musketeers and do not annoy me in this way   112.7369238195873
but felton did not come   152.4136024325005
we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child   168.1616300295983
well here s the case here s where the saddle hurts me as we french say   83.3745742571154
if it brings us back to france well   64.52421296575686
but i can not accept it edmond my son would not permit it   151.5001779762349
thank you count thank you said the young man evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation   74.34720066817927
come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody   129.2817749426368
instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to st   189.06352764695447
if we can not we will do without him   98.14418891041441
just to please me albert said mercédès   56.14340281574246
but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name   126.02189813909206
that would be contrary to all custom   148.54785603954934
occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lichen   189.99737564739246
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count s pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting   198.0882143393157
and tis a child he loves   70.84970404082526
thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it in   194.80874839309354
i see you are a thoroughly good fellow and will detain you no longer   72.92577369948141
ah you surprise me   79.73713647833739
you have understood me then dear monsieur d artagnan said milady   46.95758511064017
the comte de rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and retired   83.00282359953519
how so   203.20683161433527
and those gendarmes behaved shamefully   217.09868123730007
well i will take it then said d artagnan   17.81440010655055
with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich   83.66110493353304
said buckingham   114.69336430522144
when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the gold headed cane which he held in his hand   97.17596584246502
there is no crime in my house   126.8963909534692
but how did she become so   129.12139809997575
good morning madame said the count bowing   229.0885683758791
that s a different thing   207.1967987937166
50145m you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven   177.43341870958764
now i recollect said the afflicted old father   61.37930730033172
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit   171.27725048169253
there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall   99.18110604411532
every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl   12.187170876181682
said valentine addressing noirtier   52.96290965437613
the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent   85.28040392754966
mazarin groaned   197.9537077763364
it bears his signature as you see which is all sufficient   143.85677702361474
i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me   103.4936070293368
i   203.2837576647606
she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal   110.15355167121588
said d artagnan   101.52617870526271
sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither   202.81846508560156
then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation   161.422641253268
stay   118.40884880169169
my love for you   145.48134156126608
the silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie madame said he at length i pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here   180.70162828790004
it is not for me to judge   178.97142152909646
and how long ago was that   173.25521152685786
do you wish to go to m   100.71799005661245
it seemed to explain to him the change in athos   118.58614765120329
morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses   3.8650567229523034
sir said valentine i will do all i can to live for there are two beings who love me and will die if i die my grandfather and maximilian   113.0772418916851
he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation   172.17175479780497
i told you this i am now grieved i have kept my word   117.07861580032878
soon strange fact aramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which porthos unfastened his entirely   182.41044895674554
in a game of tennis for example   26.271437932983105
that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public   107.97320406499404
so then sir said morrel you hold bills of mine   119.51765477868885
is it then so terrible a poison   88.64334495111387
which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets   96.19917377666363
cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force   75.86541305815149
in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man   176.37656323439552
mercédès however paid no heed to this explanation of her lover s arrest   162.161509983995
send him away or you will never make a man of him   96.55410058077364
but surely you are monsieur d artagnan   95.45403641563485
at the same hour as on the preceding evening d artagnan retired   153.77956134539693
true i forgot   164.61971606699223
perfectly   125.63889047069281
two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass through   44.435062975692006
i create nothing   29.30838770147598
of the war yes but in politics you must know it is not his element   159.52506904871677
said athos trying to smile in his turn   237.25213670009987
you monsieur le comte de la fere to the right of monsieur groslow   27.61393812398677
it is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery   172.4261678245094
he made fruitless efforts to go on   210.14309828023656
p   121.08372846519116
the fleur de lis is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices   88.45177273575833
you belong to all our party   97.15318060753788
cried d artagnan who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him   51.93317264435328
but this war may bring round a peace   130.33784329879174
this letter was read publicly in all parts of the city   155.04632278005263
each had his own particular visit to make   102.11804556491484
there is no god   182.02214364956498
yes i offered you escape   131.9541192217648
he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell   74.91814322591898
and i said tréville coldly i have some pretty things to tell your majesty concerning these gownsmen   191.5467874267929
for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not repress   175.77890673051309
how far distant   232.37650223235102
since we are recalling names let us remember them all   86.57007502698906
answered the voice of her he sought   43.735204173558316
you are very kind   96.10633336945155
fifty thousand francs   112.15283146764213
i will keep my word   181.21977744974419
monte cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured here beneath this plane tree must have been where the infant s grave was dug   68.5782590459589
his brow was not one of those that long remain clear   89.22040316637354
yes dead alas   183.4697195318843
i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness   55.08755911822857
had already placed his hand on the knob of the door   12.738576150576975
the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of la jeune amélie   121.14389245089222
there is only mademoiselle eugénie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me   101.8837416139227
on the contrary i have come to a decision   88.1090797968228
bah   147.82506913409847
you are aware that may be bought   49.854725352956194
it may perhaps come to this in time observed monte cristo   93.95451620015363
ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are   161.88908154106744
lord de winter thought athos was mad   194.34136654777484
he was a merchant monsieur and had succeeded to the business of my poor father   170.09386946308467
he pronounced the words of the holy sacrament and retired giving the benediction which was received by the kneeling communicants to the astonishment of d artagnan who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself the famous jean francois gondy who at that time having a presentiment of the part he was to play was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving   45.29758099935323
one may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced   134.9462590882525
ah   92.9265917254677
do not despair   129.25296222812372
come when he will it shall be kept for him   210.84547118810832
grimaud said athos still on the breach another musket   11.440725380484395
albert sprang from the porter s lodge to the steps   165.470368631856
asked danglars   52.749373351044184
by all means replied monte cristo   111.6338344313975
dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock   132.86539207819914
did i say monsieur de beaufort   84.35613761517823
having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say   194.85396586220574
pardon me my dear friend said d artagnan i think you said pardieu   12.027388891428373
monseigneur your eminence has ill understood my words   149.22348034624386
what do you want with us   52.302657807538
that night brought together all those comrades of the guards of m   182.45744330242215
why does he take my comb   114.75968626043735
said monte cristo   109.41141055454382
thrice for my steward thus i do not waste a minute or a word   70.50948380624334
ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels   3.1178736919739833
my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which i shall be able to procure will remain my own   124.6609447709633
no one answered to his first knocking   83.52495964549203
said the president   113.0869004583852
the cardinal alighted   192.42989614680903
you shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated host   89.72438662579239
you are more impetuous than you were returned d artagnan   56.45281708057826
at the door of the chapel d artagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for athos   215.3216883039694
now mazarin was alone and defenceless as he well knew   146.78325805077833
but is the matter certain   85.46082171188806
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination   71.8220173802236
at this rather impertinent order peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt   88.9749921342599
devil take these civil wars   146.67615917596368
dandré himself   230.80694820359565
have it examined by the governor of the port said the shipmaster and give me the preference   147.44989831764838
she passed the night thus   122.97357239950273
then cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man   113.87501002111182
my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation   78.89074418293706
farewell monseigneur   151.56810306604805
what asked the duke what do you mean   95.1772302598288
but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness   200.90819338553388
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin   75.19781918678419
de la trémouille s domestics in daring to make a sortie upon the king s musketeers   230.31417279665845
it would have been one language more   241.65459441485615
i took a wax candle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my match box being empty with which i proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers   67.195182815991
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m   66.19786830493726
monsieur d artagnan is not with me   142.46828704077012
only one thing said the italian   107.86120651483752
what could they desire beyond their liberty   101.05503462179861
said albert the engagement is broken off   79.79367245114932
a shudder ran through the young man s frame   97.16537930230939
no   206.90846136144717
sir replied raoul bowing i am entirely at your service i assure you   78.65228597083795
that shoots me said the swiss   96.46967932432337
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day   115.4229303910612
be kind enough to pardon me madame   177.15765366928233
that comforts me a little   48.073302609574284
have i by any means displeased you   97.88592708677733
and she rose with her hair dishevelled and her lips foaming   115.9728789930677
cried mordaunt springing off his horse   141.7306118062663
so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more   107.11551771765983
added she to comminges   43.92705109114681
bonacieux at home it was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king   132.79741223432026
i am ready   166.16323142730073
speak not of it reverend sir   118.07288721513815
now we have not a moment to lose   93.48376962247168
though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of harrison and the king   123.39542252407324
he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly   59.338813273471416
lucien half smiled   116.24434196791907
during the three weeks that he has been with me i have only had to reproach him with one thing being too severe with the prisoners   183.52554721007436
d artagnan porthos and aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords   26.20111404386644
i will so advantageously bestow 2 000 piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for peppino   143.98235154273834
eh pardieu   60.47877321592833
replied mazarin so you have no money   81.18517775310141
who dares to answer for another man when the wisest when those most after god s own heart hesitate to answer for themselves and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate   153.38935316816185
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious   57.315966199982476
i should like to offer him a last salute   126.03622291504021
asked athos   162.22812720602326
i am satisfied madame that he did what i have told you   142.22067574150296
it s somewhere in the chaussée d antin   147.3642773408666
it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her seat   234.7849096471526
indeed as if de rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall   103.00854219127146
of monsieur de bouillon   119.01087218569006
and d artagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected   46.69032164108549
do not call anyone do not be alarmed said the count   90.51053055267644
you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning interrupted mordaunt   83.25739231717085
yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone   77.17178834724078
and as a commencement they were to sup together   44.14724557836871
he returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed   140.63562923328507
danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner   190.5105600395205
emmanuel sighed and summoned cocles   74.41898832327249
cried kitty   77.75096198806602
yes madame m   170.70750183984845
there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all   75.16462394811444
observe it is probable that i may not be able to remain here   112.81135869734274
could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute   98.59101781710568
no one answered   93.34601130245588
fernand do you mean   129.62635803573988
that s true   164.5421220274904
the order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source   42.62049761546068
i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth   171.97435263150243
i see   4.082656535000623
be satisfied my reverend father i can answer for myself   162.47957439024066
but i was hot headed just as if i had been drinking   155.5212928822489
where is béthune athos   58.22129443905616
a vagabond a corsican   104.6520206954661
oh pardon me pardon me   124.87235344733406
haydée scarcely had the count s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughter much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural   145.33826992617702
valentine trembled and looked at him with amazement   123.86448431886743

at eleven o clock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved court and the rue du faubourg saint honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess   146.60593886530515
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him   17.138177579226323
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him   210.93041026466003
but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror   126.73998611169156

there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles   267.86322624825004

but he rid himself of all his spanish shares   117.71323277747146
athos smiled and d artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover   45.55039209771718
we know him said athos he never left the king   62.44970169336187
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor   188.20337058935684

why said porthos that was very good of him it seems to me   90.12252529147801

yet i am sure she is not happy said caderousse   112.10844586959448
it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provençal kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves   27.869926928738423
the count then placed his foot on his head saying i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal   161.10154938138555

what do you think of monsieur de tréville telling me when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday that you associated with the suspected english whom the cardinal protects   129.3235489976832

asked the king   206.79604876974628
0037m worthy caderousse   110.03337887637468
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken   179.56937214919108
directly afterwards the moon rose   195.98777059010953
asked the count seeing him covered with dust   161.7031652758808
unlimited credit about two o clock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his features a person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron and directed his groom to inquire at the porter s lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there and if he were within   165.2807081491175
see sir replied caderousse in this corner is a crucifix in holy wood here on this shelf is my wife s testament   4.956990808973103

tell me what it is replied monte cristo   119.48300645949122
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went   96.57109520930439
d avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death   11.504155852914451
he persists in remaining there   101.31098875954346
the next morning when d artagnan entered aramis s chamber he found him at the window   19.26584730397913
ah monsieur it is silence   160.55354565040915
now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday   155.53104934654826
the dishes were of silver and the plates of japanese china   33.29039369534988
exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds   148.68288523147993
their horses were fed but not unsaddled   80.61309158439282

pass on before me i beg of you   136.34331602773872
of the evil you have done said the voice   233.11739426478317
a nobleman retired from service is he not   71.0053001596868
several horsemen ran quickly to him   120.96424925116399
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore   102.92041753089637
i was no longer master of my senses   103.54326433555654
you had your secret and we had ours   62.178545491593255

colonel colonel cried mordaunt you are betrayed   102.63613209258902
d épinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of m   123.41267439019327
why   239.2781816292673
so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience   25.15022803382635
but your excellency replied bertuccio hesitatingly did not the abbé busoni who heard my confession in the prison at nîmes tell you that i had a heavy burden upon my conscience   88.65213426333858
so that on returning home d artagnan found the reunion complete   112.02170787824397
here it is eleven o clock   71.86761183637165
paris is a horrible place in summer   80.76566159368124
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps   63.39663297847872

and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue   147.0690640644302
you are right   119.71374026029794
he grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treachery   81.20509971235661
a man of about forty five or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern   104.67455798285444
27 and stopped in the yard   180.19099057349607
thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures   82.9579799349859

they rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and dust   123.72801368492212
ah what is that   9.55143064059466

his name   141.7362948260684
it is he who should have watched over you he should have occupied my place he should have emptied that glass he should have risen against the assassin   99.15793416873723
one might have fancied him an apparition   35.533459175804154
thieves might strip the house it would annoy me less than to be disobeyed   137.14630409919295
the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs   109.51824091421646
monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting   80.77654850398494
while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body   86.98085664088217
how is it sir that you are acquainted with this man   64.75859699836938

the mêlée became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers   92.94573568259506
athos and aramis bowed and went out   312.50872842055406
and therefore continued athos the cardinal the true cardinal the other one determined one fine morning to arrest poor marie michon and send her to the chateau de loches   160.78251590986955
but get in fearlessly for i myself will drive you   138.55763988164387
i like that   116.54574919745947
at this moment the clock struck eleven   100.4617656990903
now my excellent signor pastrini said franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the count of monte cristo   189.6045941573825
if you are determined said athos do so   74.61344185598895
only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as i have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession   80.12851041234961

and the man opposite to you is the man i saw go in   105.05925317673618
it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all   47.99649822838941
asked the governor   192.1513899530509
an enemy in my house do you say edmond   107.11253593747448
toward the end of the evening however the beautiful lioness became milder   79.59432760395569
and now said morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away   146.2210561753563
and what kind of a man   85.88301226364993
it is a family affair   149.85653873271932
but it is d artagnan that will come   133.86182886601247
but it was without wishing to do so i swear   117.17534665704916
tell him this gérard   63.23278350952336
is life worth the trouble of so many questions   98.56980974557874
really my dear gérard you are but a child   150.30937391340547
with the first rays of day their tongues were loosened   140.3235203540498
and m   7.533918209553505

no   144.90058297828426
so that now it is no longer hatred but vengeance   77.7767979093297
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody   113.42319864402705
sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome   158.42376025282817

the steward attempted to expostulate   198.25090929468644
said the procurator maliciously   154.91506536030272
and why so   14.518469909130602
that may be said the count turning pale   176.97745374632973
she perceived felton who sat with his back toward her   127.2920779242613
porthos could hardly keep his countenance   103.40202291434989

monsieur said the young woman you weary me very much i assure you with your questions   148.97863369735177
and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning post in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy   114.05226071878482
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formed a little fairy like figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue   120.24210992494544

the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges   206.7438865098242
he then walked slowly towards the allées de meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story   211.6614500732583
you appear to think much of your horse   94.55974115243035
well everything was finished as you know   178.04662830119295

asked the man   136.7118072286995
but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress   157.83447870894298
then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought   70.42529557331349
and he listened toward the quarter indicated by d artagnan   234.95376196963886
as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet her   123.93913459640775

oh then let it be directly   140.46222580706413

and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs   73.0571401633764

of high treason   122.66463745693814
when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation   100.0041996937006
then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him   51.808682558529014
i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow   114.7014946797859
ah diable   35.14013074210807
but he can easily become one if he is not already   31.515588551088044
because monseigneur mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to breakfast   156.67621002354977
the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle   42.17241601591773
d artagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen   96.24925432217228
they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons   194.97075649806976

there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs   108.92700305228838
by degrees milady became more communicative   56.51908738220187
to the left a bedroom and a dressing room   111.85880676217663
alas no   43.057528690126446
presented to whom   105.33153749769639
she was of the color of ashes   23.33095843150602
you know they are my witnesses   32.33966270494972
as to that cried d artagnan after a moment of reflection i shall surmount it be assured   109.23694446448306
i own myself conquered   62.45645092876552
i feel myself called upon to treat that and no other   215.77645607323663

did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris   251.61054090365587
chapter xxxi   24.116420537469708
grimaud sprang up   171.38882093855364
tomorrow this evening perhaps i shall see him again   117.14990392102976
that is our brave musketeer i think said the cardinal   230.51054453387508
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau   144.78315518211616
in an instant i shall be dressed   126.90954019004933
cried athos my son i entreat you   196.8876304910254
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife   127.54182448205292
then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan   56.164827302831036
why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m   94.5474541086414
this is what had taken place we have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner   168.72761880104323
ah that is true said de guiche   60.559556662143976
no madame replied raoul   178.7450712534436
as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought   153.22454870577286
in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio whose servant he had been   134.59394447965857
i confess he asked me none   94.76322880554793
you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head   116.2317535236933
you are sure there is nobody there   96.61962948849015
die in peace   92.35435332873948
the one that is most in use just at this time   110.44253690997216
how so   91.4018447999483
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it   116.26178450464243
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france   70.02308625945125
she noticed that the young man did not say my father   151.74318797128896
do then as i did my lord   191.94628184694193
but they all understood what carlini had done   61.86804838747915
true   41.51509336138686
along the wall sir said mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves   153.40351473063072
i will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament   197.4993352825492
0243m i awoke as the clock was striking six   76.36436034410856
you are difficult to please viscount   122.38710684443006
i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless   67.2674014202438
oh   214.04463472393326
valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror   153.84465465960483
what passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony can not be told in words   187.44542311349198
but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction   14.43203142469605
we learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these victories   110.25583759043909
ah to see me   134.62843313291893
this valet whose name was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of papers and in the other a packet of letters which he gave to albert   68.57495819006064
well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy   122.84045532776851
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti   76.30491498034795
pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me   146.5294865649975
excuse curiosity but i wish to be enlightened on the subject   117.48411955356171
de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel   13.846519227496813
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell s tent d artagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle   204.6260586014871
the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle   138.0237752971512
they proceeded then on their course   60.387939736581366
at the noise i raised myself up on one hand   123.0172476281742
porthos and aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword d artagnan turned to his adversary sir i am waiting for you   75.60317084780134
the servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere she would receive him   99.7111741858332
patrick galloped off reached the duke and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited him   70.0449335499633
but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent   109.09404963142077
ride fast and give this letter to monsieur de grammont   255.71868233688943
but no one thought of monte cristo   100.8408515973638
i think he is a delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably   24.343337563245086
doctor cried villefort alas doctor how often has man s justice been deceived by those fatal words   98.18112635401039
i have another commission for you m   82.82137894910684
but it was a legate à latere who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him   183.67376545166547
my dear athos i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you for my life   173.36530384062797
midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose   158.4012553361269
at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away   131.33254545831483
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free   69.653490311984
on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him   166.61990746516383
said the queen   140.66738100393516
to the world s end   179.51012630274977
the two guards led in athos   116.46721160492575
there are four men come to arrest me   94.58383510178936
true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken   101.61258898736622
against whom do they cry out   115.66589655757066
yes with count cavalcanti the marquis his father madame danglars m   119.73076876668456
night overtook her   144.42961811249486
d artagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to return   150.1786904073671
replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port   195.03813123298892
well then that is settled   181.09467012946536
valentine promised all that morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz   290.5659849387192
probably   85.92670848389103
d artagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love   108.5196682454213
ma foi said danglars it would not be a bad speculation i fancy and you know i am a speculator   88.98211332233274
yes surely he said he said   202.1420926378333
oh dear no your excellency   194.4825785401888
we are dying of hunger   80.80851043566159
d artagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captain s alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them come along he said   97.15083761046377
coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment   153.8978784364782
count said danglars are you speaking seriously   113.94995868976854
said porthos what a fearful day my dear d artagnan   83.90293845904611
help   176.97677560537545
and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself   180.40750713398617
it is fifteen years since i gave up the office   196.09722077158094
he answered in the same language   245.94109995057005
and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lips an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also   158.67703936144247
caderousse drew a deep breath   113.87198457315489
then i am also a puzzle to your mother   114.31547568826049
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1   102.67144797172978
buckingham threw himself at her feet and before the queen could prevent him kissed the hem of her robe   166.75013392254644
bernouin went out and soon returned with comminges who was on guard   231.73614493231733
do you know my dear villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries when questioned by his majesty s principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condé   107.94100042829167
bertuccio   162.00704677359494
do not be uneasy said mazarin   46.12755008752819
at that age he can not be a traitor   130.04885377917003
in order to meet the payments then due   138.65044965494647
yesterday her fever amounted to delirium   94.93355249346723
therefore you love me a little i hope replied athos in a tone of emotion   20.006868221476395
a horse for planchet that s all   59.88623067981058
i said my good fellow that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included   74.1291693238611
said monte cristo starting   191.87813876451128
oh   81.73820969668887
your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides   136.80765683764844
the sea continued to get calmer   220.54977795174423
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith   207.06025893137345
i am but a poor friend to you   113.43933385501768
then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed   144.67771361383345
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne   108.43349373939697
said danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me   100.15141736151473
oh well i don t know   7.879853992565671
see aramis as i have told you d artagnan is first amongst us all said athos   88.68612986181824
shall i repeat to you some of my verses   118.68033233076538
d artagnan ground his teeth   185.0462072379213
here i am dear count   61.846535225889724
20105m a girl of six or seven that is a little younger than vampa tended sheep on a farm near palestrina   175.43082369792376
he said take this take it and send for something immediately   211.79949636648493
no no   149.82265012459936
although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all d artagnan wished   164.01072346301018
in this case he was not the judge but the executioner   171.65752292368526
murmured the gentleman   194.95261835515407
you will find in the same way four relays on your route   101.68003465120725
and do you know the man who has committed this deed   57.678980040054576
i have no greater regard for the bastille than you   251.28865356316604
she was a most atrocious woman   52.47853106959727
some of that at the bottom near the laths   82.0437977965508
d artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had formed   208.2620198105506
ah   158.72355629468558
it will not be a house i shall see but a palace   77.50020068112511
he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and bone   43.60926488220571
and what did your father say then valentine   170.32964086630838
but go on beauchamp   8.63049025057235
she might say that athos had hanged her   64.37003014380542
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me   73.26897752938919
but what were you to do with that woman   25.70473327156111
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity   180.67035425695923
i hoped to be able to rely upon that   109.30432226937337
it is useless   144.39071210505065
good heaven said planchet what a misfortune   196.70701274811626
count i have reflected on the matter said franz i thank you for your courtesy but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo   151.29355382624777
you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name   81.75195554135087
and do you not remember the frenchman s name   128.96278125686268
he took the opportunity of calling out his guard the swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the palais royal on the quays and on the pont neuf   132.84852374505266
said aramis   129.2866239062065
who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england   135.57423889171702
take twenty five of them aramis and give me the remaining twenty five   80.64340917830842
before fifteen days are gone by i shall be away from here   91.04949824519325
but the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the bandit s wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor   53.67731883601215
if the thing were to do again i would again do it   141.3494643377472
no it was somewhere away from here it was i do not know but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fête   30.647112155377556
bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him   125.26542848607849
ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy   223.9876334623916
where is she   140.97014311744874
nothing is easier   77.5348025851587
i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans   57.471786347205054
and have those who have lost their lives lost nothing   151.8269611831585
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine   15.206874877955897
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground   97.94334830667171
so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the 21st of february   120.2300760311299
between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged   155.4970180825401
let us take our precautions athos   96.97724753051087
ah   151.81223300380123
there is the hullabaloo louder than ever   164.11610341359537
i take charge of everything   91.19840639427109
there she must always be   5.812664549297438
with a heavy heart d artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry   204.6618862517939
well now my dear gérard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me   12.251631475263963
their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way   221.17519241976913
he said and put it in his pocket   235.37309955019194
have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape   101.99787427042523
replied the commissary   127.73835363076597
mme   150.6524735080951
chapter xli   120.47145743618371
and he felt as if he were also dying   260.1396434363236
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort   116.19593262724574
debray because i have no friends now and i ought not to have any   184.41584261634216
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark   4.392178891678157
i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted   167.57423162476175
and the royal father of the princess isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle   49.64812941434765
endeavor not to make me wait   97.07782102598557
you are mistaken viscount   170.280783207016
that man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution   138.1080741943997
replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming   71.90486194766294
hold your peace porthos don t remind me of it   98.29423397816227
d artagnan seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard   207.45590103058458
of course said he   135.20368847090577
said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count   169.60570423248828
whatever may ensue i will go   142.8599294370525
i won t be their dupe i will answer for it   177.01700743062963
but all three reflected upon the youth of d artagnan and dreaded his inexperience   48.575899320911205
and you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons were separated by a distance of fifty feet   136.29961484199947
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and d artagnan remained master of the field of battle   143.96951233096365
fernand saw this and when he learned of the old man s death he returned   147.02888869599985

it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all   165.52719003926197
although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome face   100.01035812798851

and then he added in a low voice tell your master that his eminence is very well disposed toward him and that his fortune perhaps depends upon this interview   136.56923075283842
wait wait   99.38572464992814
and yet frightful though this spot may be it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered   225.6658174866648
caderousse was like fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier   130.06271916226515

but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth   171.44095488524948

yes monseigneur   186.76923075967142
he can t go out without being mobbed by his admirers   78.62033163271234
then he paused   74.4676978807067
but the other four cursed it heartily   155.1178751841917
what you ask is impossible   185.6326352564098
and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat   1.8398223671768648
are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears   111.42600892144205

chevalier he continued addressing aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion chevalier porthos and i run no risk   183.01064234034698
cried d artagnan he s just the man i count upon   180.46009492167158
ah   211.31711185494441
were they then so necessary   87.49631987159334

the door immediately closed and d artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity   75.9714610328836
asked debray of the sergeant at arms slipping a louis into his hand   71.04082755335216
each fish was brought over in a cask one filled with river herbs and weeds the other with rushes and lake plants   169.2561615499538
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty   174.92609274742685
and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria and took his hands   59.59280676863255
the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in   177.60902970666726

you render me still more unhappy hate you blame you you edmond   144.15739703419894
she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her   204.64252201796086
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction   132.9960064523296
but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted   157.72412077917846

how soft and perfumed was the air   118.01357882826694
dantès reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge   144.602398659327
i have taught you how to handle a sword   46.1322193713889
four large vessels recently built had just been launched   86.68143159519366
but tete a tete   96.98894112960407
phew   121.29889866451366
he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste   236.01245891194637
afterward mme   42.49063761196156
aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion   148.05999844518877
you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you of am in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and i unable to do anything in the world for her   171.0522772251382
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same   60.4741954133481
well   38.663510071255004
and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it   286.8226512803228
i knew very well that they tired out their executioners but i did not believe them so strong against their lovers   130.28390202447238
so you and the cardinal have been talking about me   171.8535288023537
athos pinched aramis s hand   184.9766563757661
we have walked eight paces whispered d artagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery   110.00251841275497
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo   123.91215451226647
aramis bit his lips till the blood came   103.65922266037421
yes indeed to you   114.41840231793329
but i must not forget one grand point   140.1630502798433
no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him   147.65772390980752
that s ingenious said athos   174.97294910591717
this mendicant insists upon speaking to you and pretends that you will be very glad to see him   81.96319111520248
bertuccio bowed   203.88369529895493
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance   70.30562246223059
certainly   72.00786950986405
he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow   42.52297000336614
the idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes   186.4903930965716
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy   158.75457233296498
well   102.95424301534061
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils   148.69115274591704
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice   139.90593800556957
that his eminence has ordered you to england and that monsieur d artagnan is waiting for you in the stables   23.932139971173342
edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly   146.9989546644215
now when evening came dantès put his plate on the ground near the door   39.801125716256095
my dear fellow i think we should ask you that question   198.48374999744215
never   97.25743877070497
mother and son the count of monte cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with maximilian and emmanuel   150.26384486513314
one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not blaspheme unhappy child the crime is that of your father not yours of your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive   74.18558000141027
why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better men   88.85037376731323
and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once   177.6982096705776
but no his heart is beating   205.4413529053549
cocles made no reply   56.51643804855399
go to the parliament for it was from this parliament the enemy of monarchs that the daughter of the great the sublime henry iv   134.1033980992354
repeated monte cristo   92.19542999829191
well said the president   99.6550125751517
does your majesty remember when playing in the park of fontainebleau or in the palace courts at versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder   159.71848814798864
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind   118.17283168822117
in fact the count s face brightened   191.133936416354
these are my words exactly   170.2641956986169
it is the former executioner of bethune   93.13233095468209
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable   3.1479798927598353
said aramis   98.70302964440559
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then i can continue my work in safety   237.05430916021288
valentine groaned   13.64857018362406
replied d artagnan recognizing athos who after the dressing performed by the doctor was returning to his own apartment   19.669973217837523
for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father now a madman and her brother who died last september with his mother   102.53332959349359
and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness   174.7080152829953
he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived   54.28343559952269
the offence was public and everyone is already talking of it   160.47814310821957
mithridates rex ponticus said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast   132.45975310087545
the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and deep   133.54678658033856
you seem a worthy young man   179.84527238156136
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind d artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice   28.13967109871625
the two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated   244.0856135353401
and this very day we will write the letters said aramis   255.7720484937957
and yet it will not be the less said we were four men   93.90455198411303
moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd   66.34632365292956
you will have pity on me   15.21655107058038
then i must go to the rue st   132.8545868390672
go on sir i see what you wish to get at   161.36380395033564
i have a presentiment that we shall   166.82495168365747
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action   189.74300293862095
the count felt his heart beat more rapidly   47.07610598542928
but what attached him to the cause   124.85323904549632
ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the street   119.33205318143932
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed   90.93474208769847
possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor   154.66013347191023
a groan stifled by the grasp of porthos was all the reply of poor blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank   140.4172266798861
i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me   100.17299736826689
i came to thank god for my happy deliverance said rochefort   121.5580480762309
is it important that you should go that way   83.51894768332366
poor king   159.64906152830818
said monte cristo   80.88234986829058
yes that is a great word sir   31.988754361321014
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work   11.486830187069728
monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it   37.873826297632746
as to porthos that is certainly droll   91.94753970298815
tell the count that i am well   215.9442255623245
the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule   127.08966606027101
see this gentleman out said the count to bertuccio   153.85747106356297
he would have inquired after them of their mistresses but he was neither acquainted with porthos s nor aramis s and as to athos he had none   125.3925558409129
but we four altogether would be equal to thirty six more especially as you say the work will not be child s play   28.709870943037373
then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frock coat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travelling cap and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes   124.05982318305098
was it a corps sent out to make a diversion   157.0749325213735
yes   74.520949516675
i will come again at that time replied the visitor who then retired   111.68270987659614
d artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron   13.73519066606238
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning   70.03298444711247
de morcerf said the president as he unsealed the letter   55.10048374243838

she required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order   68.58600619026078
the war with spain being ended fernand s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout europe   80.36905058048947
do you wish to see her   35.965502212108575
the flight   145.8194413776576
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say on   110.83896928744282
alas   160.58897215179488
all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle   59.37137042581887
cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master   124.0162274791936
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him   140.45032081047836
i should have thought that his duchess oh porthos s duchess is dressed by her husband s clerks said d artagnan laughing   52.8519904719057
but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever i may be you shall be welcome   112.02398584768528
should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the pharaon   98.46603821603357
very good said the major i do not demand more you understand your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it   214.55529383246022
my god   55.987467580334396
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter   113.87397631158485
e   72.63999297554884
and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master s guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill d artagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of d artagnan or rather of planchet after d artagnan had saved his life   82.27096867299815
danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife s favorite sitting room where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself   70.30505615161479
cried d artagnan then we must stop   126.09122015200147
this movement was observed by mordaunt   134.05337333534817
in bringing the horse out to the water they ve allowed him to walk over the border   83.32015525277147
keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts   70.97890063274052
i am all attention said eugénie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze   95.4966727839161

the gates   143.27072104565937
chapter xxxiii   198.71933518634387
asked d artagnan   176.84525949688816
and what was his mania   81.1355444200334
no half confidence or you understand   124.82535442666122
then you are wrong madame   119.87756361595628
and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor   91.08802598198008
there s something promising said d artagnan   152.09182223232767
d artagnan lifted up his head   199.29318441439068
inquired de guiche   130.86535438963475
but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms a certain embroidered handkerchief for instance to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance   132.24396239072217
she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth   85.84406838040351

well what do you see from this window   221.15090397216255
cried d artagnan   190.42713805088806
i swear to you again rather than betray you i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces   94.65307285646068
the executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard   144.21584773544484
but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed when a company of the guards of his eminence commanded by m   153.80253550155584
it is enough said athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours madame   140.78985004527323
de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past   113.97135900067259
now i recollect what   142.7911503929554
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence   142.90557354878575
dantès himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb   182.49251384613132
i know nothing   106.84442343906757
said lord de winter   105.55814107478342
bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way   15.49227507522113
mundane presumption   33.574281726846976
then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads   49.55225135930789
baptistin who rode in front attended the count   57.824753983520345
my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen   94.9798519558087
cried dantès in a paroxysm of delight   14.26888656187684
the major made a wise choice   78.23320737688408
i believe so   153.52884839502806
asked athos   111.08075009272308
asked mercédès with an angry glance what do you mean   3.114456941453497
you do not know how much i require this assurance   24.162399330678795
a table ready set out awaited them   106.94540435668672
well then at the end of a month when drinking water from the same carafe you would kill the person who drank with you without your perceiving otherwise than from slight inconvenience that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water   162.42129775745215
but he had gone too far to draw back   138.658856593116
he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a musketeer apprentice   59.07900537257447
they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from acting   225.75593766811295
thus while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left she broke out into sobs and tears   74.27450701426478
are you fond of traveling   169.0482037555367
but take no notice   68.57426904824867
oh my god my god   70.07517236279574
thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission otherwise   63.88957091935622
what were you doing   175.16666268885032
who can possibly have told you i had had that dream   233.2159888156088
i am neither an angel nor a demon   58.63016605096406
and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes   78.6268760602756
are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw   121.89911351483956
to which he adds that of bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my troth   78.35724920774385
and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abbé resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table where did we leave off   186.16482269637459
franz d épinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will   4.653360530699217
are you a surgeon   185.93462812616562

here said milady rising with the majesty of a queen here felton behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl the victim of the brutality of a villain   112.53452503516196
as to d artagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards   95.7219671514557
taste the hashish guest of mine taste the hashish   63.39983114340641
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me   145.90803770828893
yes sir   181.57990732918825
when their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom a messenger is sent to negotiate   59.77657708181982
zounds   65.31982806777438
my name must rest unknown replied franz   195.52265776249274
porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly and shuddered when he felt the knee of the procurator s wife under the table as it came in search of his   113.72783530363732
exclaimed athos pressing him in his arms   35.6002199511486
like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous   155.8000508543265
this last explanation was wholly lost upon dantès who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth   214.8531546970404
he said   170.92991737139513
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project   135.91424876894595
well sir said de guiche are you going to reply   130.96783018445709
on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you here   75.16357709166209
cavalcanti i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends   80.75459217032636
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven   147.67890970001156
it was not your opinion that i asked said the queen sharply without even turning around   208.38394061533853
she was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted out   89.87454679038991
a fallen prince   132.114196906888
felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening   164.0303687040025
say there is no need why dantès should die   55.87407629747718
come to me   175.99872308873458
monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer   55.527543698220455
an explanation at the opera   273.4646508139067
what is it   100.12240952917618
madame henrietta of england daughter of henry iv   12.328045060888513
my intention was if caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the custom house officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew   88.82080642966596
there is another method said aramis   68.48443660718806
for what purpose   117.33284434639398
and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times   115.79826862088157
yes let us go   123.43126537111986
oh said valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear m   23.54358471590953

bells did you say   178.50468390179003
asked athos   141.41967832693734
he saw the deputation from the parisians enter it   138.68511988600528
d artagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise   85.34236795395607
pray don t mention such a thing said the count   26.81591525537111
putting the letter in her bosom she took her son s arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs   86.64021302671577
i am cold sir said mousqueton   25.42975278633743
and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away   82.00628058037995
but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt   159.90999955607992
your private adventures have touched me to the quick   67.59216482829791
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole   78.6385528401889
andrea sighed   200.28005174698575
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage   195.24767280095335
who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him   129.16176869458442
athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled   148.69188547746847
when   124.81908090117574
count said villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes   134.62824086782007
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best   172.43122557786282
no doubt   213.65720610819034
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my father s brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse   140.195000395204
never monseigneur   110.3522482962363
but let us be united as we were to have been and then leave it to lord de winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife   99.29896240155259
see look at fernand and follow his example   108.013635144241
fifty thousand livres a mere trifle   155.6725122984318
read and answer or i will blow out your brains   157.49927936148674
the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded   131.0987335753188
come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they want   210.6058651789382
do you fear he will not understand   185.55821974416628
à propos of the cardinal monsieur de tréville i am vexed with you   39.98108080522866
no she said   146.6509426266032
dantès saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand   218.44732219466243
my dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within   126.63271443167947
the pretty landlady was desolate   107.52871876822263
i am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well   77.65920010208237
he found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound   71.34536303672925
were it not for that i should thank you for you have worked for us   121.65724562454714
planchet all astonishment was busy grooming them and had already finished two   121.69371644095737
the sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor   228.6827946527427
but where you go i go   192.70321135999063
but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation   78.68021906926998
people fight for all sorts of reasons you know   113.19208033855415
as we said before by ten o clock almost all the guests had dispersed   67.30054448840036
how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend a friend lost to him forever   190.24535071353336
i will show you the way back myself said the captain   148.70890829534582
villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child   191.2188143595689
d artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter   145.19518020322894
well grandpapa said valentine kneeling before him and pointing to maximilian i love him and will be only his   105.3247520801733
cried charles juxon thank you my last friend   85.35622371812049
but who then is andrea cavalcanti   87.84461784490838
porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size   161.4198608828904
you are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely   121.8937877153073
asked the king   69.84570625657099
god s death don t fire   86.28565008022252
i hope at least that you may be mistaken   21.981757331100226
and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her life   166.99424558127737
i command thee   122.97304144388079
nothing else was talked of   65.73669578728915
then my dear mother said albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber   82.93551987746216
albert shook his head and looked thoughtful   212.51399738232993
mr   0.007991523953648993
m   104.67421079897836
it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria and in making himself loved by dazzling her   82.33650143300571
i killed the duke of buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain   182.36027989500468
he then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered   232.60586644768233
i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is   214.6079939214935
richelieu and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can   135.0892097232051
but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me   77.84316425900215
wait said bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted wax light with which he started the church candles   132.8302597746795
what ails you my dearest father   306.445500350584
said planchet   166.35914070666848
now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon   104.27819343018074
monseigneur replied athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him monseigneur the musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys   158.56723338381784
no your excellency   219.7766802558836
i was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me   169.41077116239404
he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw   168.50886150273965
but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared   131.6442150091574
yes count returned julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen   221.85602278688614
the other members silently dispersed   321.8550698456131
why didn t you do it   120.15841789994616
noirtier let his head fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful   78.32354747113922
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly   85.77304805914719
i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated   153.9442680998058
well then said cromwell i promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request   6.608140057973145
scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son s room and inquired from laporte if the king was in bed   192.48671815184642
he ejaculated italian   206.6396345173319
28 gaspard puget the sculptor architect was born at marseilles in 1615   93.0329101107525
that is that i have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation   126.56595132054127
because the fifth is dead as i hear   54.032610078927405
besides my friend d artagnan has something to say to me privately have you not d artagnan   170.05245524593727
well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder   167.4999736540555
you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d hôte of the hôtel des princes or the café de paris   2.687286105492376
19 in the old greek legend the atreidae or children of atreus were doomed to punishment because of the abominable crime of their father   72.41791037348878
there s only one remedy dear raoul that is to marry her as a compensation   160.87061324344796
said d artagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to him   124.20244364329761
i answered and we perfectly understood one another   236.20386789284342
i feel the blood flowing towards my brain   115.4914691817365
you are my own darling child valentine   71.44239737243149
a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast   198.5939393514251
and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my man   101.29026973311696
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges guitant and villequier mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man   181.4059995952032
continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me   168.36990404124776
you had better see him for his madness is amusing   159.34956881481952
never sell it   142.7947547669744
mordaunt followed bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out   151.359475540826
chapter 75   145.4248742504977
he is the evil genius of both of us   143.4208862310197
nothing   57.192808401708774
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz   144.34044436342418
nothing but bitter recollections   114.17807574923965
he called   54.65959603219626
rochefort extended his hand to d artagnan who took it   118.38931260759887
if i sought your ruin fool i should drag you to the first guard house   150.82281511670072
the monk   175.01249175125707
but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate   130.35332103732986
we have reached it   122.31006814743014
but instead of growing easier dantès pains appeared to increase in violence   107.55863361192553
return to camp and you shall know   139.66084288809873
among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him   178.48994336241645
d artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp beds   144.34282685513892
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos   63.79737087896757
grimaud began to scale the wall again   180.56608162152457
yes   73.50856588900531
they were placed in a wagon built on purpose and thus the sterlet lived twelve days the lamprey eight and both were alive when my cook seized them killing one with milk and the other with wine   178.71038881162747
madame replied de winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you   89.29477658798032
fernand mondego   109.79332604651424
on the cross cried i rising for at that abhorred voice i had recovered all my strength on the cross i swear that no promise no menace no force no torture shall close my mouth   82.12870266750994
they would hate us both less   122.83817832788331
but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible   187.57484270836935

concerning a court intrigue chapter ix   171.7745171163419
d artagnan in his fortieth year   2.3912975088451844
the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd   171.1533786102585
what did you refuse to dine with him   45.057074908202964
oh madame   74.8793504198349
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it   57.64749260019308

you knew him   30.31568496776299
let us see said the queen what the count says   120.00641255166472
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life   119.99754141069829
who besides don t understand political matters as we old soldiers do   155.45135114870783

monsieur is as usual led by his favorite   138.41942548588216
asked aramis   93.00631524479809
asked villefort   202.4701511475402
but he did not appear to recognize him   73.13162082592844
good god   67.41198138744568
should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured   113.41539466816644
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep   90.09072976555507
i will do it with all my heart said comminges   93.99271773635638
oh valentine he asks if i love him   95.21664549202842
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken   178.28852094761226
aramis here   163.43991033489723
then murmured louis he was well informed   3.287819867141124
andrea cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the banker s house in rue de la chaussée d antin   80.17801492440879

he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name   98.5780301659364
and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme   39.35233213108275
my mother was a christian and she prayed   103.38733612519157
we soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into it   107.54547348679888
but hush here comes somebody   130.31390421928788
and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat   72.84408009347
the procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m   45.147147382523514
yes yes everything for him   101.07291183052472

i am sir a living guaranty replied monte cristo motionless but with a threatening look   179.07753820003188

dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door   90.86991665567609
the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old man s bed   102.30200058864352
but you should take me there one day with you   134.93168460247122
the messenger resisted   240.77392260234876
now then who are you   85.823628002448
ah my poor friends   146.94862914697086
parry bent his head and whispered to the king it is the comte de la fere and his friends   109.85140679254934
said porthos to himself   122.50218457489295
we must seize the felucca said aramis   204.3345391426849
d artagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis   106.18125240058146
the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion   95.55974676414411
in addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous he has received another right through his lungs of which the doctor says bad things   132.9337562813992
aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood   129.95914100839005
egad   134.18208868189137
they then went down to the thames   137.60426627830614
to morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent   83.77451428360519
i thought perhaps that the king s death has only hastened their flight   90.53341078828868
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum   111.83214193907915
it seems that he is a spaniard   120.39616011863744

but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard i did not lose a movement of his features   168.38429983381297
but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him   152.47019419210602
that tall harsh looking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute   44.23348799414424
during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape   197.87669580449233
but d artagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams   26.01446528519726
said baptistin as if that name sufficed for his excuse   57.55618890971978
oh spare me   157.07710303547688
porthos bowed to the cardinal   183.71719766591616
your excellency it is done already   68.7807578654288
it is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at tréport i felt the electric shock   92.2408255928668
still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partner s murmurs and lamentations   15.826616333713702
ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears i see that i am condemned to die   195.18989977016795
but this first desire of the heart is imperious   59.2158649721558
the bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques rousseau you remember the mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger   14.340348216917889

the cold sweat sprang to the young man s brow and his teeth chattered   50.032470609161464
four hours later he was in neufchâtel   197.9120395144088
whom   54.21156205696259
you see it is not my fault   194.4630624566036

i have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire   157.20427193665824
the woman s lips seemed to move as though she were talking   20.99678564578491
he cried   94.4823486366934
as to aramis he never played   69.25056337936505
it was your excellency   100.16899455646217
the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that   210.06459234735976
this verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer   6.805526863619036
do you know m   32.84221313650305
you are wrong replied villefort significantly   48.820564912735804
the valet ran directly   81.31691126864465
coward   232.54285948038984
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role   85.6706663135107
are all these crimes committed on his account   121.03842088680909
suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard   157.17987613164448
the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said you are monsieur d artagnan   82.73078389872236
i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort   69.08788093113168
and in case of surviving he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct what a madcap i was and what a stupid fellow i am   100.66036245894615
this chancellor was a pleasant man   175.0827206677263
let us do justice to d artagnan   55.787566970720576
for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea   226.77597099417486
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done   172.5375340058135
he inquired   31.209714355079257
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me   68.39177789711215
and perhaps my god   60.785025434883316
my lord you have abused the royal power which you have almost usurped   150.24214936225758
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house   48.36367203527426
and has he conformed to all that the letter specified   164.61120286904028
he again   60.55809481269113
you frighten me not executioner s axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and i strike you now waiting patiently and christianly for you to return the blow   116.22064075998638

one word more sir   156.99021561545368
22 now in passing through this room andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him   96.12135924889128
that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten   142.31450098792615
she gave it to me herself   164.72022790609924
then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris   91.69607827765242
one can easily see it comes from a priest   117.90371613784042
morrel he has stayed behind sick at palma   78.95763197431478
the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of raoul   98.8469210440443
and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve   152.3386284254986
confess   108.93949597059013
and franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day   79.679902024758
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects   109.14638468802423
he was alone again   72.98020734677141
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes   47.59063609434172
do you see   79.57423210687972
d artagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating air   176.85249190548268
at the fifth stroke the door opened and lord wilmore appeared   126.01018848604656
i thank you gentlemen   85.63377926157185
pardieu   112.09676038031789
indeed   85.54945284458488
porthos began to be suspicious   167.79409808158698
it was a very serious charge   158.55155077535065
you are right said du tremblay   162.56417421883253
let us be on our guard   185.4254467068746

the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme   129.676027874833
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti   114.39477073265888
have you forgotten anything   92.47805009979817
indeed   40.29430992971666
for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone   6.968994603371968
like everything else with money   62.350881819253814
père pamphile had seen dantès pass not ten minutes before   166.26701593711581
you will ruin us all   77.91648478898875
only when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre and that he might repair at once to his post   109.3669106501487
and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy   178.79881802266706
and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter   10.149761095088166
and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent said aramis   70.92664371418518
but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him   157.54050328671025
and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care   146.1408086783486
the count who perceived that m   47.87559612195143

in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her   84.67834371677996
cried athos   179.08916384444308
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg™ work   113.4741928978955
no no cried the abbé   122.9556823305412
he felt assured that benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self love which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart   101.19549767308087
oh yes   196.5950213763604
de villefort be for all your goodness   110.01186318265346
or his mistress interrupted d artagnan   161.58563420334016
the usurper landed in france near antibes in the gulf of juan two hundred and fifty leagues from paris on the 1st of march and you only acquired this information today the 3rd of march   137.08322268972603
but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today   170.25140816007095
only it will be an infamous shame   81.85725592921723
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself   128.83326960892558
but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say   89.93072723622733
insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong i sought not to shake it off   233.8830375867669
is the young guardsman at home   118.52563236425793
besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible   79.60941303046636
i did not observe it yesterday   116.0855689776358
by my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied aramis for even i feel a shudder at the recollection   235.7361035743694
oh this is too much cried milady   133.89725076613377
but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye   182.344889546126
well sir returned mazarin prudence is a fine thing but to day you might regret having been too prudent   232.53701859629143
i regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the gascon impudently firm to the promise he had just made to anne of austria   102.68113269489528
there   105.28047591067349
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite   13.358347087720915
you will soon know what to expect for here he is   92.99575533680206
parbleu   38.14439940003706
well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess   208.67340007865664
and here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse   93.30802407500634
perhaps so   97.12376263975419
i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m   172.30057792724753
we must therefore watch and play a close game   117.76858268813402
the next two days passed in much the same way   194.32464059227348
but could i do with a million   91.89222850448802
muttered gondy taking his hat to go away   86.79588082364225
the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the air   12.598006883201634
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity   93.41822635442608
oh merely a paltry fifty louis   118.60664539503811
who knows   91.27891555613336
he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnères luchon and cauterets   3.0960125325656804
it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it   84.95019642467226
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat   196.87569687021966
they are friends of the duc de beaufort   199.6881601764068
porthos instead of returning directly home d artagnan alighted at the door of m   128.99762116861285
why   100.7838851154023
de tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair   162.6205772241275
his singular host evidently resided at rome   34.264773651315934
nonsense let us break open the door and if he is too far gone in his madness well we will kill him   112.21563822103626
de château renaud m   100.1116597320869
grimaud bowed but stepped back   122.86709198219688

and as i am going to the red dovecot myself i shall know if you have told me the truth   18.688240829526848
and it was this young man who brought the monk to you   165.6383360197015
happy on the contrary for what am i in want of   86.76926199826642
de boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twenty four hours since m   157.64605759607656
good said mazarin i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation   138.10183743877286
asked mazarin   156.85354267475665
moreover you are our prisoners   54.05822736707272
morrel looked obedience to her commands   123.43323667082554
chapter xxxiii   52.022822277495976
and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital   138.51440771784047
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts   153.91400965245884
some insisted she was making for corsica others the island of elba   135.28439572406893
there said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire   131.9373419522264
eight or ten days afterward aramis received the following letter my dear cousin here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of béthune the air of which you think is bad for her   110.43592312713626
turn chartreux or trappist and relate your secrets but as for me i do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms and i do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening   207.22388308684702
he has just written to me   124.08853519780382
de tréville s private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl   14.466658995510329
lend me your livery till tomorrow   128.63414807465526
ah   125.56401528137097
in each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be levied   100.65950322070033
four of these men were our musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just received   70.75980084844718
so it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and la ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster   75.79545339399439
i am like nero cupitor impossibilium   109.53320484913863
well i call you and say to you friend felton john my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this woman   18.068128910746054
he knew his time well the hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty   88.6909281012479
every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice i am he   125.83378537957155
an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death   77.04474195067266
34   112.70701250529201
he was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and hair as dark as a raven s wing   38.50731232861298
but she is not mine   69.73487625912277
it is men who drive me to death   138.31856471449518
he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand   76.6734175122163
fear that relentless pursuer clogged dantès efforts   102.64839773677163
but don t fancy that i am going to take you on your bare word   36.98794946173611
said d artagnan   95.53832146813502
her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect   151.61957818659448
what man is that   143.4604926851553
the four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared   184.58623261898282
true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest   98.68203077552849
morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns   67.45709627665157
but no i found nothing though i had made a hole twice as large as the first   62.37211250517972
bills upon his majesty s private treasury answered d artagnan who reckoning upon entering into the king s service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood   189.88656026663858
my boy said caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating   166.65322601113826
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happy   157.65813604657035
after giving some directions to ali who stood in the lobby the count took albert s arm   100.5454578457818
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark   59.091546334849504
d artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box   98.04539361572594
i have that honor your excellency   79.1341507246036
this point settled the duke turned to d artagnan   199.8883505667577
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird   151.0301692510422
alas   120.46987872950228
all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf   136.52044610406247
athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands   30.780603783977682
i possess nearly 50 000 livres in right of my mother   116.51431570022189
the four others were french and wore the uniform of musketeers   78.43665490770942
besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on that this issue was near and could not fail to be terrible   165.51280620749355
command we shall obey   161.09425069249414
one day he had the imprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal   104.0600706181298
say no more about it   85.31697018344389
but drink some of this   109.43931234354656
the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man   140.5768712284624
you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body   144.51706069514913
and if it be what i hope you will do well   233.54405442086187
you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions   233.38512219386112
on the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own subjects   85.61664620270483
you never knew her   91.53902248147969
said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven   6.063306865845561
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine o clock in the morning to take a third letter   149.99649095974283
the moment you leave me valentine i am alone in the world   36.75021345485381
that will do   113.82747032049826
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera   103.2888884707323
through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley   101.64752258384794
there was firing nevertheless i heard he said   197.0694827507084
she went to meet the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham   148.28616798391508
come with us said albert   122.30077897747526
the unhappy young man had not thought of this   143.47806595317223
exactly   104.00966763706806
no no no said comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were i clearly understood what the cardinal said to me   120.74872839737586
and he smiled on receiving d artagnan s response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages   180.1782555793026
conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis   151.6134235286682
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century chapter xi   125.50544119726428
said athos satirically i saw him   138.38806135334337
why is that gendarme there   83.65920324626791
and you say that monsieur d artagnan was one of those four men   102.88557294906867
and therefore said d artagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abbé d herblay   128.48071265423843
have patience   222.6523777487091
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death   152.8774972942034
said d artagnan to himself   121.06449823767664
if he stays in we will break in the window   97.4771551057275
but what are your intentions   70.83222134400934
but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished   187.32412629111596
yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis   190.92070714919532
interposed laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle   82.97287743334903
well   143.51339344768192
another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements   40.90959032008121
all four came up together   141.32098246234656
planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servant man with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself   168.4976043516118
the prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court   195.63325374408785
egad didn t you hear   183.4012191207031
exclaimed the young man   50.91654386838209
then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open ledger   38.187514605088765
than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion   98.40685743264794
and yet he but desired the good of the people   179.8417293282562
said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men   213.12501151619108
in the midst of one of these swoons i heard the door open   177.693526075133
no madame   257.6628953935068
and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert   176.13088174432647
said julie   176.55858598742043
he exclaimed   77.87678990281073
traitors   179.01095196482788
danglars withdrew   111.48716318431349
as d artagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything   255.86536396117506
let us see said athos assuming in advance a critical look   18.076867569465506
ah that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess   89.05389516145158
i see it and i thank you for it   114.66150342603333
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice   33.939909740186394
yes by a blow of your fist if you can   81.44137080438253
heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him   90.71971018436207
both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking   187.22128643165078
that s well   121.39921629936048
this was too much for felton   91.21575530579793
everything had gone on as usual at the palais royal   86.83758159726166
you are looking for my daughter   75.3062547576128
he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a tree   207.7899499676941
and danglars sighed as m   122.21123825151163
but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him   70.18338583288579
hum   34.902898659629884
ah this time cried d artagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me   84.27909363004217
he gave me a sign in the affirmative   46.706124335899105
and you have seen this cavern morcerf   117.98542869373735
then both mounted and departed quietly   167.13268151720263
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless   130.3948843192943
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father   155.28665329081127
i knew a lord wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind   97.2133670300583
but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions   97.4566783527165
of a woman to whom you have told everything   99.65706818008707
is it more serious than going to m   122.03592931940004
yes continued caderousse so it is   113.29695547976179
he is sure never to leave my service   194.31212022594934
i know that by name at least   229.03437896944456
porthos   68.34408253182502
if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose   193.85850336774058
i know not sir but i thought it really very fine and grand   151.2895122917538
they sailed   21.97426344630763
if monsieur de tréville heard you you would repent of speaking thus   157.3039769120219
and i will pay you or i shall be dead   87.42080573313987
for as i am in great haste likewise i wish to beg you to render me a service   153.9701103075088
when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that   260.81440346468503
planchet yes i have found him again but he is lackey no longer   84.4118336643914
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man s eyes   221.0470360722843
i faith   189.75922082104364
the gratitude of anne of austria   108.15769068787321
d artagnan remained for a moment motionless asking himself where he could be   151.3709229796051
what next   134.38887677895497
it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean   166.152909326403
is what you tell me true   119.2599997583662
vampa in this attire resembled a painting by léopold robert or schnetz   126.0822192133008
who is this young person m   143.17810119622754
but time fails me   80.91571510265476
the anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer in spite of his efforts to suppress it terrified his sensitive inamorata   145.64997516145598
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met   90.21396757356541
after all i am not an unreasonable man   122.67069993218995
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity   79.03742923424957
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed   162.80560602263955
this was done instantly   69.21352925682098
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of spain   170.3296167121591
pardieu   124.2784759479538
god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home   28.556540338273635
d artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal   190.61647655039982
well   131.63594699509363
now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine   105.47670912802421
very possibly   129.34907076968864
replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back   129.7227297051339
there could be no fault to find with this arrangement   82.88042414235377
asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm   106.3504370980645
the stone seems very brilliant answered the count   15.08569326363562
and the spanish woman   141.06894144045117
and tell me did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume   101.2879742349536
ah my dear fellow said he to franz   139.04588135548536
m   104.66418812615552
and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him   125.68917310404152
when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere   207.55034460356364
what   200.2700422432316
the cart must be tastefully ornamented   175.60584449769289
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time   182.91336838627865
the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney   122.94143827278204
but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive   178.3194787473518
and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire   208.25578185966432
tis caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return   161.89316798708327
both   52.36903139980258
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals   114.99566635333827
there that calash filled with roman peasants   115.4888444406176
the man of meung chapter xv   58.491253542221955
he remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed him   209.2176980496858
more than ever   85.12657588729333
resumed the gascon   154.5147468283895
in this case replied caderousse let s have some more wine   28.98046892534893
grimaud obeyed   23.13185927598296
what circumlocution   116.01998027372098
the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the banker s house   26.09639485041572
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the count   145.5205452990435
i do not say there is any truth in what i am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night   167.12572697028668
she exclaimed rising   225.27626117684488
morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his forehead   121.65670703766001
you have probably guessed right   208.75768794634007
another person was confined in the château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest   92.07552771914625
and he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of mordaunt   154.25399972273988
very well said he go and attend to your affairs since you seem to be in a hurry but come back in half an hour   140.13222500367604
you see you were deceived murmured the magistrate   126.4559789269543
at four o clock as we have already stated the mysterious personage arrived   237.2647170959051
the register of the birth of andrea cavalcanti of your son   172.6359363708984
there s a life for you said caderousse   150.4883348139066
go on go on   132.2217468398419
be satisfied my lord i will tell all that i have seen   121.01845106553233
cromwell smiled   63.13008601687344
and you assisted and took part in this great battle bragelonne   219.31739540767816
said a loud voice from the staircase which porthos had just mounted   39.77002438274795
it was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short summer   123.76179157298314
but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another step   160.62933649929806
making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than napoleon did of his battle fields with his sword and his victories   101.9541269139095
and then the baron hastened to the duke s chamber   95.71588964973111
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens   43.99950238288709
old pastrini our former acquaintance received the traveller at the door hat in hand   164.4302288313263
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven o clock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity   198.28239384069929
and does he not live in the champs élysées   130.19758064214167
the pharaon left calcutta the 5th of february   26.39214958820466
the dead once buried in their graves rise no more   26.034593327898833
it was illuminated by lamps with ground glass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoy s weak sight   49.43670866956569
if he demands my daughter let him fix the day declare his conditions   125.59872401798681
while speaking caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions   202.26161171150557
we have lost too much already   19.86513213932085

of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom brisemont poured the lees into a glass and d artagnan desired him to drink it for the poor devil had not yet recovered his strength   33.16401047318614
he who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there   33.777375638621336

like a genuine frenchman albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening s diversion   106.7570911304907

vampa then rushed towards teresa   178.63558890516543
the young men had no objection to this proposition   86.88121923944792

whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here   51.09912472906902
bonacieux whom d artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him   118.21961597894449
why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me   94.31201840901582

prevent me then   139.1554192596848
monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either   103.2635864088871
why it is with him i am also going to fight said porthos   122.33592933541674
and that was why i threw myself between you and him   114.08927325114078
the little old man remained at the coach door   158.4137481878043

planchet shook his head and said nothing   45.54980195615808
what is he doing   117.35314315586128
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to st   190.28301037156757

why yes he is actually insolent over the matter has already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker   125.91759779479051
and then my lord continued rochefort you understand that to emerge from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change one s prison   139.88323798188316

this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word   34.648890018445684
i trust all this will soon be taken away   97.58164715318841

here you are   124.68477811837434
then approaching monte cristo he added especially before young m   72.59344362901517
the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris followed by mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm   35.55282382480648
i never lie madame   108.1481205467155
we can not fight with such names   89.06068887750246
is he tall or short   119.10608435715848
i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are   187.73038306840562
oh as to that i do not engage myself   31.239205433920745
he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit   136.1757703272648
then pursued the young man eagerly   191.29213434972843
are you not the beloved of one of my best friends   39.96608647250632
don t you see what i told you   86.64014794111743
they were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of d artagnan and porthos   147.94635848559238
and in order to spare you all the annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing i send one of my officers to meet you i place a carriage at his orders and he brings you hither to this castle of which i am governor whither i come every day and where in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other i have prepared you a chamber   108.54352113397347
and if we do overtake him   95.20059885135494
but you only asked 100 000 francs for a fowl   139.80966603611822
ah that is another case   99.23036103455803
yes that i have suffered   50.832262981413564
was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one   109.28002004063623
d artagnan drew up his request and m   126.15397454572377
with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of cahusac crying to me monsieur guardsman   11.702446063668376
if succor be sent to me i will accept it   61.141590774051394
the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor   132.2746233429851
obey laporte do you not see i have no time to lose   229.21013701410686
vainglorious as he was porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least half   6.2306279529749276
true replied faria we are prisoners   16.33994178358941
that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen   107.03781004128072
is he still in a fit   92.4583729950975
chapter vi   202.93000537427275
the devil   147.26418886009776
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape d artagnan appeared to authorize the issue   206.88542963504318
well read the letter again   21.545964670632145
he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather   39.96257495431169
i have learned some fine things concerning your musketeers   101.25125721826882
i don t speak of my brother   131.70004815648494
she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant   91.07242108808535
cried the duchess seizing athos s hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you   86.57561589608116
at these words there appeared in noirtier s eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there you are mistaken   157.71820286112774
after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of   21.104583790627473
suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at vampa   58.57242231247111
does his island produce him such a revenue   57.39120486352178
nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said d artagnan   88.89639212943209
give me one i will give you the other   89.19023950859983
de boville   126.03656570364129
i pity her then   181.39387388865157
truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate   96.57872863495201
what a brute of a host   96.75140822061954
she will be the sooner with her mother   132.1963812389497
the 5 000 000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand   90.70282636244949
once in france he turned his course toward paris and reaching paris went straight to rue tiquetonne   1.2964473974744095
de tréville   136.0129506327984
you remarked that we were all active vigorous and armed   74.66544755746239
do you remember sir it was my idea the scotch treaty for giving up the king   71.93577568942536
in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another   154.56918642959732
noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer   119.41664064988778
de tréville hastened to report himself at the louvre   108.27420125890151
is that all   28.559838675037668
at your age   10.316526781318089
said the englishman   113.53622729819809
at the same time d artagnan felt that planchet slipped a note into his hand   119.67587968488017
d artagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive   108.32061067017025
he saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery   98.8272164761058
the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed   234.63147647959252
a name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way   138.5377692455556
propose mine to him and let us see if he will be more condescending to you than to me   77.72472118139471
do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands   132.0156481857289
and rushing towards the door she opened it saying here edmond here i am   128.22920853867927
these 3 000 francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future   87.78677683219215
while this dialogue was going on the two young men and the poor lackey descended   144.77866897337276
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria   153.5423618029461
no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening   159.96639053619919
we need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels   145.54596467096468
excellent   116.2030226623314
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants   180.0321609339445
villefort started with joy   170.12184210761313
sometimes with the queen of england sometimes with madame de chevreuse   115.82949766336532
i am a supercargo   166.94971128188985
i who have a seraglio at cairo one at smyrna and one at constantinople preside at a wedding   190.6251464876566
the principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep mme   21.96974037521005
but no matter   105.92591085126406
athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street   133.68921658524005
very well said mazarin if i place you in security in a manner evident palpable ah   152.1043835537321
all i can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that providence   154.46193648570312
to morrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after to morrow five and in three days you will be in bed   58.305850064662316
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors   95.26730427691544
monte cristo bent his head   201.9375949849707
i will go myself   78.30431776627977
ignorant of their real enemies they do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks french badly but those who can say fine things to them in the purest parisian accent who are their real foes   116.54358979786808
i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you   69.84083325248315
as soon as you feel able to swim we will go   135.7950944453953
this reply reassured the vicomte   81.11051323820996
40174m what i have done albert   142.39095251346268
said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow   41.174558993227535
she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince   183.74833806925307
this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and i don t like to humiliate people   64.44432109117193
but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me   145.25500621655698
balls parties and fêtes are over   143.9264516383427
in half an hour we shall be on board   242.4449739490425
dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god   72.64644521966616
monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips   131.97316829361765
and that one thing your lost child   164.94196260521318
one of the most agreeable possible my dear sir   87.9961818213837
but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone hush   127.06820390217611
only remember this if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear for you will look and you will listen i am quite sure however we may threaten you you are lost   151.48369217614066
said d artagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave paris   150.66984767710443
he had made his valet cover him with honey   76.81850396268601
raoul at the same time seized one of the young man s hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man   51.44482773553693
and you wish to announce the good news to me   145.23347922696752
we fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by selim   113.05107659541076
yes   187.4819670449916
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task   150.55408311910986
remain neutral monseigneur if you find that i act as becomes a gallant man   92.1179891405522
then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit   107.09273299817767
i feel some need of it   106.7172081003571
the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself   173.80945357526815
what a confounded country this england is   88.8068363944094
which d artagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following conversation   141.84954426992462
anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her   83.78519887510976
after quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided   123.98549630397885
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse   71.68415437867813
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england   172.40213220902697
i was still stupid from our yesterday s debauch   23.40177966473223
formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request   148.7329746585511
a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort   37.1146079314788
a troop   69.06729650299008
i did not even know that you were the person i was sent to fetch   177.1504012734706
who is it   46.525994169866195
you have seen your dream realized   58.22401082301356
near the camp you might be recognized   91.71025333083105
and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person   122.32043345969275
fatality   70.29657683192934
ah my dear father   159.6474011408714
cried aramis   172.82651064158173
then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to d artagnan i was not speaking to you sir   144.5628063547871
said the count   159.69394427427994
her hôtel was remarkably sumptuous and while the most part of the english had quit or were about to quit france on account of the war milady had just been laying out much money upon her residence   58.874087127977575
this hole communicated with a kind of loft the space between the floor of the king s room and the ceiling of the one below it   11.738937114485168
the woman of the garden   134.01489284453677
several times even i felt a smile on my lips   156.70644925077772
with princes not with presidents councillors and low born lawyers   69.1343419231234
he is scarcely five feet high   83.64407137880406
his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines   227.18015262490943
do you think so m   158.89876463374756
why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond   211.2344878929571
you see i am a good sort of a man   161.04287667511326
madame de villefort fell at her husband s feet   23.834673751291376
f   157.085902912653
he said after having swallowed the divine preserve   100.92155659093183
well then listen valentine said the count   185.84606852130938
where are you   2.5513465425924835
down with him   180.16706391203317
besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about   44.738726665515486
ah   198.6121758120258
however as porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to act   132.98370342554432
said tréville not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you   23.74385197268687
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain   143.45955674564397
my friend said athos i have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary   221.44575528266017
well then with the first money i touch i mean you to have a small house with a garden in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle   89.02925724244463
debray   157.77062170324092
his teeth were clenched and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him   59.216556720557655
yes   175.81499995306572
and fifty empty ones   46.01255211835192
in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy   133.70374691137286
he repeated   31.807959785681888
well the fact is morrel i was thinking that i too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself stay   240.03195141250848
let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door   255.96283302974123
limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from   123.43209793820473
ah you have seen aramis   76.59644350449784
and he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldier s half pike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his place   134.75046495847928
ah dear constance i have found you then   175.52007511575755
this dungeon said the concierge was it appears some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner the more so since he was full of industry   3.3351322739984113
i have never accomplished anything alone said d artagnan shaking his head   115.0261139606252
take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor   188.35295176044613
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary   54.366184484483966
their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures   93.88355793531873
porthos was seduced by a wine colored doublet and sea green breeches   131.46769177794505
where   226.21678046877486
why here they give you their hand they press yours in return they keep up a whispering conversation permit you to accompany them home   194.3478118985921
that too is impossible   156.2793746991108
what do you want with me my friend   132.25992821081886
a bad joke of the husband s substituted the other   157.7076646267275
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood   84.61254979915596
what will you do with him madame   185.57671857817886
if i am in fault i will avow the error   133.59149950155955
no do not seek any longer to discover the reason   165.02672218602615
i am going home   103.1236804081586
no one would have thought in looking at this old weather beaten floral decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things if in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with it had also a voice   140.76756982838023
day came   140.70015285496999
you madame   237.4083103790353
beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us   31.850772777099365
danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coupé   22.53168795171041
you have the window that is sufficient   229.9047401940742
for m   176.9054212799521
i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders   133.1473710224115
ah capital said beauchamp   184.6059405215678
you chevalier d herblay to his left   49.961713413906395
such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristo s door   230.47297543233276
the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now useless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell   109.7001687132049
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long   43.35314010221167
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief   133.55772652924907
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph   102.00521339970926
the robust scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover him   59.951842861592674
captain said he just now carlini would not drink your health when i proposed it to him   123.38009112772923
the door being closed the four friends waited in expectation   115.68385406368323
and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the door and left the room   71.45149307033427
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages   104.49306850526915
asked the musketeer   120.45638098686241
advice   74.96212799564202
they will discover us   100.22233575454395
you dear mamma   70.94701558662325
two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital   92.7351706028272
here i am albert said   39.75265555682104
nevertheless whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey she resolutely drew near to aramis s shutter and tapped at three equal intervals with her bent finger   77.97605069588685
you pushed me upon a heap which rolled down   122.30632911492968
let me stay here   126.90503378499963
monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly you see i was praying   116.70634093482865
de tréville attended the king s gaming table   137.55740810943274
aramis came behind giving his arm to porthos   87.93638644274078
cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us   30.1954516673664
you are insupportable   102.41288666701008
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other   176.8872762753085
faugh   117.21825603065314

at five o clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had   177.76075042636683
it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly   78.60703170836624
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption   55.33613140269443
monte cristo advanced a few steps which were heard on the gravel   106.92824959460165
is he alive and at liberty   51.09783965894373

did you tell him your whole story   59.29156076046909
i thought i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle ages   97.25151833562646
it was the governor who hearing of faria s illness from the jailer had come in person to see him   189.86715729201896

this postscript decreased greatly the young girl s happiness   189.21357793580904
cried la carconte do as you will   135.97142446722623
he then gave himself up to his happiness   137.05417763218932
and when once come to paris to draw him into some snare   177.91184276393156
that s true said he quietly for my part i have never loved   137.47251020967894

seventy six years   164.12142214078932
upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before bazin   161.45302866197693
i now see my error i acted like a madman in coming in here   203.06708895957945
impossible   84.93837348181668
but he is perfectly unknown to me   104.95428280499446
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his departure   114.51663247047993

every one turned around and beheld athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat   56.22823867284219
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied monte cristo   72.72211628460877
you see said lord de winter presenting d artagnan to his sister a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands and who has not abused his advantage although we have been twice enemies although it was i who insulted him and although i am an englishman   165.0553344612945
i will make you another offer   92.97254495880821
but andrea drew a cigar case from his pocket took a havana quietly lit it and began smoking   111.89160075451626
he was a foundling   100.66464589548352
ah said the jailer do not always brood over what is impossible or you will be mad in a fortnight   145.9087189618024
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling   157.19772009186852
and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of pistache   262.5898640901927
you are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out   126.84379750306493
it is all one to me now said d artagnan   18.97049716561058

peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier   107.51204502930575

sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact   241.93932928322798
and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune   141.7839602637051
will you give me a lesson the day after to morrow   47.47264886638958
the other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman   77.31844468531324
i have no objection replied m   9.81625482828349
de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother   200.36313470098307
then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played drank sang but that whilst playing drinking singing he often stopped short to vow that mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at vincennes   34.202721669775784
i too am going   104.96275529968605
he doesn t wish to speak   163.35557631234624

i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others   11.461362116914415
a man whose name is franz d épinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them   157.5733978689571
by the bye continued d artagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body   57.740167472363964

chapter xlvii   125.0993846266118
thank you thank you murmured she   157.98841469878656
athos upon a horse he owed to a woman aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress porthos on a horse he owed to his procurator s wife and d artagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortune the best mistress possible   77.15395166429296
your horses got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strange looking man an arab a negro or a nubian at least a black of some nation or other at a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself   111.62770679986123
my faith yes said athos   156.4685521837022

how sir   106.65035488375713
the monk that was shut in with me   142.367256835942
he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell   204.7734802835672
here is debray who detests you without reading you so he says   113.04730616892262
i am doing a little sum in arithmetic   113.65498824940657
who   82.16269664230077
said beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend i need not tell you the cause of my visit   151.507211124663
better than that   119.14121666245747
by the side of the luxembourg   82.60562911505679
then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart   73.99856365060761
the fourth of 700 000 francs is 175 000 francs   140.87206522543104
what could she have done to you   87.27589994462602
you have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for i was about to form another plan and leave you   59.3529256479025
we very nearly succeeded in saving it   153.367334307249
she wore a blue and white striped vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls and a sort of bodice which closing only from the centre to the waist exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom   133.43615874020918
or tomorrow   93.40615030344283
my mother is not woman but a woman   170.9092631760169

one brought from fifty leagues beyond st   109.98415805668752
time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses   164.33633111346956
ah   148.17238522200347
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain   102.25465158055754
my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you   75.8579482609477
well then how am i free   43.93253343130169
is he a shepherd or a nobleman   155.97752912428146
i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for mousqueton well agreed for a pretty mule said porthos   56.16464440264519
so would you   102.90079325829217
what shall i say to the cardinal   142.723012797501
say my highness is furious   88.14685687655033
then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon   33.1726115961779
i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this much desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself   12.113558651348313
toward eleven o clock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court   13.253281931537401
it does not concern me you are right   177.39562033694088
nothing   132.18316975186536
all crossed themselves   150.74014608299572
her wrists were bruised   133.11046819782445
yes the servant has given his description   89.21266124978555
madame more hopeless than he thinks   188.2548240095376
well then said groslow bring them with you   107.83775379568104
de wardes   99.18220503499212
but remain within sound of the bell   104.17817149147777
those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime   114.88448158069728
and he entered the little room in which edward slept   41.924755575390066
the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me   131.9948110656093
a play   95.25169620116364
that is enough to drive away all my pains   80.61713206377084
for one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect he threw himself on his father s neck   87.35716473975562
several persons are invited and among others m   117.31012937099025
the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive   138.56261413636267
40108m i promised him to wait replied morrel   164.54299380373962
oh said morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side   114.59640612686871
i am endeavoring he thought to make this man happy   74.128130052429
i am a friend   96.66091898723971
do you understand me   160.47685215654374
this man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty   249.35212342567442
your name   176.36453125895994
you furnished a principal of 100 000 francs   113.13054039500477

be this evening about ten o clock at st   95.31990758076824
in what month   132.5561943547073
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden   182.561734686144
but he had scarcely left before danglars with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frédérick 24 exclaimed fool   174.01041289240845
that is true   172.6678439367888
said andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected   150.6577792339711
i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort   15.488756214194439
chapter 12   252.03815618395
what the devil do you see so bad in it   121.50314367149402
bah   140.9134868966098
speak   74.45958529669831
and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us   159.82563934975676
then you persist in continuing that thesis   97.0954852840441
oh what an abyss   146.66707507026706
d artagnan did not smile   241.38564318348213
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them   135.92249824192476
it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs   117.36495199568411
cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants   71.46978217958988
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the swiss   42.67822840681356
but let us see your plan   59.52998631482438
inquired valentine   145.38277646048272
but how could a poor catalan fisher boy without education or resources make a fortune   23.32073383763165
exclaimed rochefort   65.08321980815893
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence   9.981874306563043
i agree to athos s plan   90.50428728201675
yes captain returned carlini   77.19078310768438
cucumetto had violated thy daughter said the bandit   210.86385989050544
but that is the history of the hundred days m   133.79560079323693
the abbé told me it was worth 50 000 francs muttered caderousse   38.07400913350027
i will leave the paternal home i will give up all   123.08807510904714
you are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them can act with energy such was cardinal richelieu s opinion my lord   89.84781476989838
two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as escort   187.58499108341198
was this prepared in your presence   75.66135366310344
mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one   165.58595708651555
the boat moved off toward the left hand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner   8.3286461220315
but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was non capisco   51.51903834052227
you are mistaken my lord blood will flow   75.27462732535574
the young man remained immovable   46.67398066858233
the men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers   98.39434015961649
you know he has estates porthos   157.91855002443995
it was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak   109.2071198712891
now pass your arm through this opening   57.90144028336282
said morcerf in an undertone   181.65198341699224
the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbé who lives next door to you   42.42181463043069
bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him   194.26570036858405
cried the queen   162.7695214710968
planchet   200.22359188467266
yes   181.81680260709112
but i have not told you that i know him   160.11622513267707
he thought he heard a sob   98.90066040028512
the night monte cristo waited according to his usual custom until duprez had sung his famous suivez moi   150.84902513728287
see paragraph 1   180.60538640381463
said monte cristo   203.57881185499156
to the residence of baron danglars rue de la chaussée d antin   143.57985320303342
and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis   15.690326145275066
he could not see it but he felt its presence   68.06558250881557
willingly   71.07193813675136
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass   243.6817978227686
yes said cromwell but the lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished   91.2931396782744
we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health d artagnan   37.12137785671928
there was a moment s silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror   262.7854868989052
where you please after you have put me on shore at portsmouth   142.27346456244794
we have him   180.30997040310604
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper   145.45505664246218
he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament   117.95598574099671
on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants   227.99054313934525
but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences   164.04255763106835
first you purchase a house at auteuil this house is the one where i have committed an assassination   123.62163136679635
well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be possible   77.17880957031429
indeed   30.184357661879474
well then monsieur bernajoux said d artagnan tranquilly i will wait for you at the door   131.88614903993755
40162m rise   189.8670648678745
but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis   83.47776705158682
if his mistress abandons him he will find friends i will answer for it   166.63200718031936
if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery   248.40768661759415
maximilian morrel said the servant announcing two fresh guests   128.47756728205164
good   136.83066657621399
you are accused of treason of abuse of power and murder   85.37756955027568
morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owner s hand m   151.43505445429187
ah   90.4404100477193
planchet and fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor   79.37057049638216
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him   156.31945750198028
i must be alone   2.81281198613965
and do you morrel accompany me to the champs élysées   50.475654160860074
i have no time to see them   18.23200638824511
more determined than ever   121.69036302653136
the punishment of death replied lord de winter   30.19560984371641
as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing   49.580494334380305
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar   102.42956080190899
yes sire   160.03265223318118
have you had any account of it   129.74316151670322
you know something of that as well as i do i think   203.44919838759708
do not seek to assist me in that which i am accomplishing   187.94648253547712
you will restore them to her majesty   128.834117329943
really count if ever i thought that i had a friend in the ranks of the royal army it was you   115.83269746983504
answered d artagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity   70.5734275213446
it closed after him with a spring   51.2359181105016
my fist is strong enough i swear cried porthos extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton   113.28543175722335
at least wait until the story has a conclusion   87.52893044805433
said the young man   225.86811089026875
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them   14.411771893954779
he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles   115.01278868377074
but not every one   154.90995179520405
oh   145.4687257943914
ratonneau and pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the château d if but ratonneau and pomègue are inhabited as is also the islet of daume   206.18639287224113
if the king persists in remaining in england will you send him succor   11.688688992619163
and then added in a loud voice to any one except mancini   48.7963267669067
summer balls are fashionable   87.58947798820088
i should like however to comprehend said porthos   47.960303314871524
it is more it is magnificent   95.91181214928598
everyone turned towards the procureur who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his nails   61.035590745292545
no no   172.1075414114225
and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles   51.899721593334334
by the way what   173.9451457578303
the old man s eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness   155.10395320410544
tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily   85.70395877305914
asked morrel   164.7414418970683
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly   116.90929667983698
albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young cavalcanti   195.95216403364813
d artagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbé d herblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend   91.93596213103699
yes my lord   4.55794715516204
mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times frederick of prussia used to be   226.8910182588814
milady was wrong in fearing that mme   106.23213460883657
but still we have quite lost our dear eugénie   203.8362930071356
her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees   174.4997489692363
indeed   64.01922972646972
but i pay that out of my 150 francs that is understood and as i require only eighty francs for my journey you see i am overwhelmed with luxury   122.77579407372978
with a thousand pistoles one may face everything   2.596679738562159
i am tired cried d artagnan sitting down   176.19532705853047
do you think so   147.49814267794966
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy   158.98029575724883
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men   98.75408655120006
i have just killed an old friend   85.32273725912749
the president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place   143.8350217176279
at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man   229.01939649773857
and what did he say or rather do   63.98562752154753
it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other   59.88226653055041
there   213.77068813724406
then you must come up into my room   119.01392687125747
i know not whether he is still my friend but since that time i have remained his   44.91923187108573
in an instant all five were ready   245.44584910045518
he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master   180.68453415841407
you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them   134.8855049554386
he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majesty s command   161.50958349922274
ho   106.4456853346733
this is what i shall do   165.9274541329118
cried d artagnan   147.4386032424532
now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting   131.82693110269682
repeated monte cristo   34.81069082691877
cried d artagnan   150.55923872877594
oh no returned monte cristo negligently   28.357449426871796
my friends said parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly   192.0132953701547
the two friends looked at each other   158.5960718440791
on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy became president on the place of his uncle embraced the cardinal s party which did not prove want of sagacity became chancellor served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen mother and his vengeance against anne of austria stimulated the judges in the affair of calais encouraged the attempts of m   153.1949390950832
oh no   180.44997334684547
asked joannes   68.33589598087156
if they resist we kill them   52.985285140921334
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it   46.33690823445109
nothing is lost then   162.47279608109793
said athos filling his glass and that of his friend   199.98802972700565
the money   145.47466770691818
monsieur de longueville is of royal blood madame said d artagnan   195.7385025154782
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coolly such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely   108.4086360847727
org license   165.75105616558307
and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity   118.17982393656891
de boville despairingly   152.61882689129274
and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner   79.55086770831355
mazarin   187.67640504085153
there was spain which made war against the king   142.90338365466206
you are rich then   190.6988298635136
i shall find many men as able as you are   214.75091506951148
and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do   93.53039767249267
her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable   56.940268317078186
said aramis   192.05322704628966
asked the host   74.50803154260981
anyone else would have hastened to receive him   69.37350704219226
but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages   128.5799010377081
do as i have directed you then   62.723696322415385
the abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m   54.696416733734054
by jove   173.99835408395268
come let us see what you know   132.19335186757388
by jove i am falling or rather bayard is falling answered porthos   152.16195932760257
but as she was only a procurator s wife she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury eh monsieur porthos you don t offer me any holy water   41.64267726695863
d artagnan who as a gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athos s maxim but he did his best to keep up with his host   117.38068589394702
and in fact they went away quite proud and happy   68.07009364489318
yes   150.16620322261818
kill said she but spare the honor of the widow of ali   149.41626539057643
milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face framed with black hair and whiskers the only expression of which was icy impassibility   250.1687196349731
and will you not torment me any more   62.88235939943121
no his name is the count of monte cristo   55.99467249408679
i am in his majesty s guards monseigneur and i have no reason to be dissatisfied   73.17429142041607
but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower   7.899968705334587
demanded the concierge   168.58001973103714
d artagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of porthos which amused him greatly   48.91518860332398
far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast   56.66272787539848
that madame is an official secret   53.809383923400084
this one will not oppress you by his dignity   136.9817047838139
how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face he had been jeered at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life and m   98.32398163139572
it would require years to do again what i have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other   60.963613579724345
remember your promise   63.08820769575827
cried all the guests simultaneously   135.82646711051729
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out   150.13529631028598
she exclaimed   193.3694312871395
and on what occasion   7.171577919252101
and in the evening i took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where i had concealed my treasure   83.98268089939384
well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond   159.22971725595042
ah that s true   237.35303511846206
but as m   10.719029277585705
you should have traced her   72.24307607870826
i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is planchet hesitated   119.22754122424949
thirty crowns   82.31336191111392
you talk of flying mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queen s hand led her to the window   40.215522154109024
louis above the order of notre dame du mont carmel and st   144.05639300958285
de villefort had taken   178.262914114566
their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the king s room so as to form a kind of trap door   179.2528357160479
say it my father   102.85408485089303
where did you place it   105.34084492560744
then he took the glass emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed valentine had taken it and replaced it on the table   213.62424599235996
happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach   115.49044909325077
oh it is terrible   195.7790189878497
i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet   136.67842685839653
i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness   130.9255988990602
for fifteen thousand francs   59.29336744563466
exclaimed franz   153.6480128848032
do so then   96.10135913635081
these conditions being agreed to porthos took leave of mme   21.626894995391382
d artagnan rose and took his hat   75.58509295150145
if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost   33.09524944730657
i can not tell you   91.64764186079466
what do the people want this time   121.05765397858742
you consent then   92.24256999722161
meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction   172.83883166287052
yes replied d artagnan from this very day   141.22968865402493
asked he   41.992549797328834
but gaetano did i thought   147.1813920457331
he laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under him   87.51578829789499
i do   220.93724832445594
oh said the countess to franz go with all speed poor young man   135.84133072202002
therefore i only purchased two said aramis   77.91059829928685
but though i can not give my own name not possessing one i can tell them my father s   90.61731187139407
he resumed   40.681153569372995
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day   119.1108956365469
go on   171.331890138575
these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families   136.31790998947884
thanks replied the jeweller   169.87932568245193
give it to me then   134.40805989976494
tomorrow at the hôtel field of the cloth of gold a lackey in black and red will wait for your reply   160.63532867692206
except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted and which might interfere unless he acted with the greatest prudence with his own career gérard de villefort was as happy as a man could be   242.0598933352747
d artagnan began to smile   150.7312890778478
tis mordaunt   77.25414167850077
what   146.3118251430088
i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces   105.4479529490085
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer s son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which dangling from a leather baldric hit against the calves of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback   65.79102285724078
the extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely grecian   118.26156497175776
let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed   233.91822350223012
no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount   127.65631786884275
every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations   71.71053196458655
come gentlemen your swords said the duke   33.647795287362044
he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water   2.959359700329614
what do you say to a thousand crowns   46.150812530990265
yes replied the invalid   64.75879650605074
nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this   74.79768671976217
counteracted by parliament and insurrections   181.20314953703593
athos   86.07731916544131
this famous invention of yours   87.7384404738106
did you see all that   124.7155037045516
he knew the abbé de gondy only by report   184.13022485355816
said caderousse in a choking voice i was there   175.38187554091667
cried d artagnan   98.96255995912637
here said he leaning heavily on the arm of monte cristo here is the spot where my father stopped when the pharaon entered the port   165.36275700718744
mazarin is better lodged said aramis   168.28999982280274
well that is scarcely the question   209.4018127407538
besides in what manner can i make advances first   217.4699493510937
the prisoner made no reply   89.79080609531522

when caderousse turned around he saw behind him la carconte paler and trembling more than ever   103.82158223591436
porthos looked at the bottle which was near him and hoped that with wine bread and cheese he might make a dinner   27.81379459389092
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you   30.19734147633193
at this cry all the crowd re entered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult   160.3049897911132
it is the first time then that you ever went to that house   82.642841878425
replied m   10.75177624191842
so a pretty little lass my faith is that soubrette   12.235168936320264
cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience   160.75868045591858

having seen jacopo fairly out of the harbor dantès proceeded to make his final adieus on board la jeune amélie distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him   80.90616717294981

let me see him   34.82173726472472
and quite a national one too replied albert with gratified pride   195.1124037721292

i shall serve under the eye of your eminence and if i have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then i shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me   154.95904258883348
vicomte said athos to raoul follow the duchess   164.11992131230835
she questioned emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew   67.42155969805042
and feeling in his pocket he took thence a small pocket book which contained ten bank notes each of 1 000 francs   89.25916381347207
oh my god my god   138.7416093637099

dearest dearest valentine exclaimed he forgive me if i have offended you and forget the words i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain   144.69171314877158

bon jour messieurs   162.44176642082675

at the end of the dinner he entered in person   132.62742949453073
and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged   157.53395396269894

the island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance   63.84245755700523
replied franz   77.43493152428704
andrea felt his heart leap with joy   45.40063529822061
already rich he held a high official situation though only twenty seven   180.29671836646017
now let us try to take our revenge   155.86081874086796
bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe   136.64024260519903
i come to say that today and for the remainder of the carnival i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal   59.65988974069164
that is to say athos porthos and aramis   139.299446453935
it is twenty years since i saw them and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them   205.7927243072589
take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my lord   167.3399284512343
then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern   118.967996501885
heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself   118.6610299528106
he told luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it   180.01340912408017
sir sir cried he turning to noirtier do what you can make me understand in some way   104.50336347830932
i have paid you five hundred of them   110.011626749566
she indeed reminded one of diana as château renaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute   58.50916055509146
lord de winter d artagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her   166.06583106032832
yes i can easily comprehend that   156.71793664854926
they will be ten times worse off in a week   50.657935672324086
hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of you   159.6028209398134

the baron d épinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged   105.65315902875503
he had therefore plenty of time before him for noisy is only three or four leagues from paris on the road to meaux   212.93173635568877

it was a new face   114.44069341046664
danglars lost five hundred thousand francs   60.00942914207893
it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m   46.25416944440346
after that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort   28.98980068861306
it appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him   75.47150021224238

twenty times he interceded for edmond   121.14045104065217
exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets paris   113.6531333076047
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice   80.9033990757065
he said   118.01399961661296
he received thirty sous per day and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch and affable toward his master   182.14244421460785
while uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together violently   10.760921227395073
i have concentrated here at naseby camp all the resources heaven has left me and i write to you in haste from thence   10.79190620102655

villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house   78.82306199425258
what a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar   229.25221102265095
but that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the boulevard de la madeleine and an income of 50 000 livres   69.1264681134979
i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he   113.44165888550071
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance   133.2249624431218

the carnival was over   183.15912539988028
chapter 90   106.87483059686238
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him   157.6244131860223
i should like to know upon what occasion   196.34173372020723
take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so   181.04448376080194
he passes for a very charitable man   192.91356868957652
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion   65.72753321173987
asked d artagnan   59.1293379300443
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties   153.77565137415195
if it is monsieur d artagnan and his friends he will bring them to us   180.3101235285367
brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them all   47.30872868077415
does anyone dare to slander me   96.69584484589193
to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them bassette passe dix and lansquenet in their utmost nicety and winning from them by way of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour their savings of a month all this was enormously delightful to porthos   115.90915075884934
the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and i ask no more for my husband than has been done for me   136.12740061495492
exactly as i have the honor to tell your excellency   189.32623885922516
the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward   31.487478372414927
i was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves   78.88582716952209
he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse   160.48834201738134
one throw is soon made   134.06660951764098
what the devil   156.99522220221257
did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing   41.238735339614834
mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make   47.645479828033615
there are loaded pistols in your holsters   133.21341612374454

you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1   156.4756116972553
but the lady   152.2721316409264
there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old   106.03100949415732
luigi arrived first   121.425954001873
at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out la bruyere and du barthois   249.0908043525299

courage courage   208.22128411596
it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed   108.52496394934633
colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it   63.50476942716723
no   213.29113035632503
then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him   104.52279248728138
they exchanged bows and d artagnan returned to his companions   153.65071845260954
bear with him whispered aramis   154.83727891976378
coquenard had since the arrival of porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk   89.78327118076342
he took his seat amongst them   296.06020546887555
the abbé opened his mouth hesitated for a moment then making an effort at self control he said and mercédès they tell me that she has disappeared   2.4575741666397874
cried porthos do you think so   59.83845096121724

soon the water rushes out of the scupper holes like a whale spouting the vessel gives a last groan spins round and round and disappears forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea   114.04336838841472
for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire   119.81967934913965
yes sir   180.83603816089374
see my lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself   29.765967896193672
alas said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy   10.664442652801554
five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs   47.17321648674864

how did the viscount albert fall into luigi s hands   61.09283789510603
in the place of the palais royal d artagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens   55.345475897104514

then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing   185.79965578978369
at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl   51.16520825501959
ah yes i know   93.97484957369747
meanwhile andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming he ought to die   73.32786551418977
why really the thing becomes more and more dramatic explain yourself   94.98860360524141
do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles   172.65154200052254
after walking for about ten minutes during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds   169.3817770875021
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table   139.3214877685749
i do more than permit i exhort you   137.37288631353036
doctor pray recall your words   78.68354781107607

i think i have killed the insolent fellow   142.02333331383153
sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave   221.8051773541275
yes   75.12014313870567
with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs   157.20783954864726

but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rival s attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension   72.34980254968177
he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth   103.43606783551108

i must beg your eminence to observe said milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his grace distrusts me   23.803121712770746

but yet continued the king undoubtedly my haste accuses you wrongfully   129.2385879270299
he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner   135.13326937242746
how could i then return to brussels   213.6845779330098
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole   10.766695169435778

de boville who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left   148.7298968501879

good caderousse   5.8575632121874435
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour   205.08681521747053
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously   181.6713135051869

and i about ten pistoles said aramis   4.022641836035206
it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him   159.87081924975752
i speak of the prop of the state of my only servant of my only friend of the cardinal   167.39497259887756
20177m the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men s minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld   85.26603346606497
but first tell me were you going out or just returned   113.49625787088846
but all took up the cry in chorus down with mazarin   126.97137976291036
is it my fortune which you find insufficient   192.52235235250444
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong   211.83549896776793
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect your very humble and obedient servant godeau purveyor of the musketeers that s all well   125.78437869070572

the young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the boat   39.63432612333045
it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me   91.78382555708055
de tréville contented himself with asking d artagnan if he could do anything for him but d artagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted   151.33089733078336
said d artagnan   101.40568631149793
athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior   153.2841986030832
she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder   142.34541465261754

the abbess who was the daughter of a noble house took particular delight in stories of the court which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom and which above all have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away   69.91328960008245
buckingham remained nearly a year absent   144.35641495276118

asked aramis   104.32227230707701

for my part i ate but little   79.97136741387092
murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered   28.194717593590354

yes indeed said he   123.29598999644551
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son   178.93653124418563
the twenty men marched straight toward the barrier but from behind the beams from among the wagon wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time planchet s halberdiers appeared at the corner of the cemetery of the innocents and louvieres s bourgeois at the corner of the rue de la monnaie   106.76681318633979
then bring some wine said d artagnan   188.1373021513017

franz d épinay   140.77907958549235

it is possible such may be the master s intention   123.97652499844516
the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension   172.69342894401052
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves   184.7427337635973

he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor   82.5502336557633

well   142.62654452655661
oh no   80.88233252636984
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before   86.2188026661176
yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the baroness   112.45999358187473

cambalet his niece   35.228443252161526
the abbé smiled   164.35986894229893

no one can be more so monsieur   14.001725688743505
these last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them   110.76240900066797
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that d artagnan had not come to béthune   49.57326647627484

caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment   135.44029182977482

all the preparations were made with a frightful calmness   160.5667375027566

clearly said d artagnan we must go where they will not look for us   210.34179116378044
yes indicated noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his glance   123.81100253082175
as d artagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead   128.500211148813
you have a recipe for it   132.8689023001546
when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard   117.59798469956843

the time of the carnival was at hand   140.9921612822978
no said noirtier   128.61274892537435
this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it   80.19309705254639
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish   59.42874272629258
grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening   92.0365663968781

the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal   100.21099873496058

then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city   132.11796958235888
that s what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio   65.4334121504919
but how did the accident happen   25.514697760112384
the fact is said porthos aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke   119.52524658726622

he darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey   113.42635490534656
are you interested in the sugar question   91.45120789693289
you lie you lie   213.3153704133519
i am free as a bird and have wings like one   39.678772468138874
said aramis blushing   64.62751873440249
de villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty   69.08551032239822
and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt   179.56575853582504
and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye   121.99470624709049
but there is another over me   97.0421944383846
i think rather than give pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of offending the count   66.92760268858655
yes monsieur one and twenty years ago   204.6654164141042
fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on one side in the corso and on the other in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the hôtel de londres   221.92046277426425
one day benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree   162.16279625284818
there is the prince de condé the hero of rocroy   122.27653642768686
amid all this d artagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos   174.34724813926638
do you know him   84.24272149983841
i do not reject it altogether said athos   181.65268183768205
fly   161.0519783335003
fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a word   234.5739305312917
i will go said the monk   135.68459683634111
what is that   125.03911597675102
but then look at my desk   143.24707265533664
i made no resistance   165.0938683028814
he s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head   66.90784677224423
monsieur replied dantès proudly it was only to summon assistance for you   130.7356393227313
but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messenger s departure   147.8620733606043
i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so   116.36921855181606
there remains then three hundred and fifty   212.1945438021309
for a moment d artagnan thought that parry s brother had disappeared   58.74941943016574
permit you   157.52463419470473
oh no monsieur d artagnan said raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you   95.73997692257447
the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé   105.60304651353468
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky   45.15391626755866
one   72.89678010205088
you have given your word then   27.104766823975694
hark   167.21859967593412
cried he   78.06790871115552
and me said athos she is my wife   191.653237183809
you will then assume your proper position in society for i will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours   62.9522197551514
he asked where their masters were and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn and were then settling their bill with the host   71.49878640872782
rapid as had been villefort s glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate   131.40965614525228
another horse   112.71387659783734
but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given   48.84427426634484
parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep   167.8681670758502
that is all   90.65723126315204
the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them   193.14732600745126
oh   94.30478976307037
let us go directly   207.39629389523796
in fact said mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed   29.93389327305374
aramis s searching look seemed to seek his friend s thought even at the bottom of his heart but d artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity   126.07736667872312
d artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old fashioned taverns   117.89069853691534
the count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge   74.95946145605316
said albert with a thundering voice   85.57680214011711
and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture   146.57031574590368
my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector   136.55855331003355
well   165.21037377566273
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission athos for generosity is a hero of romance   121.1658751927042
a fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside   80.96820862152589
yes count you know what i told you   77.59378659996199
bonacieux   79.31860794816257
yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy albert   205.51246949208019
for heaven s sake not a word of this before him   131.98488946079914
he had reserved from his annuity his family papers his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary   189.8854895081205
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light   52.451065583747535
the rendezvous chapter 39   127.35217999163417
madame danglars did not see them   123.04722580003556
what inconvenience can it be   297.9354830142572
suffer hunger   186.21572969105117
and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency   105.54020108055201
then turning to the baroness may i ask how mademoiselle danglars is   88.98996389783039
it is not like this then said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain   149.29560938857097
but a humpbacked general   94.90320996526395
said caderousse   105.3463194715214
that s true said athos and he rang the bell   146.01017702887475
coquenard in that tone which says take my advice don t touch them   14.788549896392453
murmured porthos to himself and then said aloud thank you my cousin i am no longer hungry   234.98838991717832
now you are a man and are able to give me advice   84.53191133745415
and therefore said d artagnan to clip the hope which athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity   135.3341473224286
and if my glass was good and i mistake not they were foremost in the fight   24.791796266578032
so you have seen the arm that was all   158.63149478016646
for i swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years ago you athos in the rue ferou and you aramis in the rue de vaugirard   96.33909335817677
from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues   169.61397777206415
content with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and re   111.6945410625785
you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking   157.488626182681
i told him very humbly for i could not conceal from myself the scrape i had got into by laying hands on one of his majesty s musketeers i told him i was quite ready to submit to his conditions   67.62118817380284
he knew the king of old and he knew that all these complaints were but a preface a sort of excitation to encourage himself and that he had now come to his point at last   215.54499619688934
i wish to speak to your mamma   70.69320404679897
yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of to day and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church   199.17712339783162
people die very suddenly in your house m   91.56604529731499
there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so la ramee when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss   32.36936383636619
no replied athos it is not the search of mazarin that i fear   43.46242046850902
cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name   112.20352947840169
the affair at armentieres   205.99473109911912
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses   136.89864783325962
it would seem so   169.72098668575387
beyond the fortifications through which athos had made a breach in order to get out and which were composed of fagots planks and empty casks heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art they found swimming in puddles of oil and wine the bones and fragments of all the hams they had eaten   92.21586346866886
certainly   122.57805955495283
is that what you wish for   62.00062534688907
the king looked at aramis with astonishment   127.56812232050616
let us save the woman   133.4575182973903
yes i insist on it said albert whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings   146.3451929083382
9   92.8838322140057
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle a stab with a knife for instance   202.55863015222565
the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived   151.16291620234006
it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek   122.1577008312547
the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity   131.29668690073925
noirtier do not complain for it is for you that i came and my journey will be your salvation   126.20070980436718
a simple question from a friend would have irritated him   116.17536312691537
and from that date up to the present day a hundred times perhaps   68.85783466421861
entirely   127.46842678471201
let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off   80.85998256116113
an unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristo s in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m   81.46922697158593
how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did   22.748341656549186
if you wish it   85.2603079076434
if you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not so   99.65360976599848
the flight   82.09830804606175
cried morrel gratefully   115.09655280574546
but she waited in vain   75.98066541264127
what can i do   145.37918638386972
indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping   246.47068869032185
and you really understand none of these signals   213.56030216741738
at this order given in athos s habitually calm manner the face of the gascon relaxed and porthos s brow grew smooth   134.60408484880605
joy shone in raoul s eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle   106.90200812752063
he cried what bad stabling for my horses here   103.58347170031593
it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight o clock   167.1245981602988
athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to lord de winter and the wedding ring which charles i   73.13255533888088
m   24.046205230489136
on tuesday the theatres open at ten o clock in the morning as lent begins after eight at night   224.07070170019148
the deuce   164.46004188205592
i shall not leave my grandfather that is an understood thing between us   109.35597313771754
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees   188.65037552403487
d artagnan already wore his uniform for being nearly of the same size as aramis and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit   207.02114914704578
i embrace you with all my heart   53.231269598945545
but he found athos quite himself again that is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men   74.89094988232341
yes go   117.19680036651327
e   93.92363925358303
give me another cutlet   89.75645682975231
stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit i am in it   96.7167632660462
cried d artagnan breaking into a loud laugh he having heard as may be remembered thanks to the broken boards every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife   126.39926413231278
morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son   176.35006890738248
at this moment olivain appeared   64.82105686796069
their tears will deprive me of the courage to die   193.0305023252764
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel   188.24158213251476
speaking to you as a friend i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be   167.30340293588853
we have nothing to fear from those who love us   47.81704999838702
charles smiled   147.6420104938399
i am at your command my lord returned d artagnan   113.36060996380202
i thank you for the warning said the count   128.04696463414248
and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news   158.08591718587445
he was introduced   14.890671118264095
it is impossible to know   159.5436629094775
but with that exception i am a good drinker   111.8594169415874
tréville had grasped the weak side of his master   140.9903702956655
by kitty s chamber he could gain that of her mistress   90.56002732051422
and m   91.3548453476804
i shall only have to cross the river and i shall be in a foreign country   64.2554481199407
i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination   239.3934814633473
but after his bath   186.6901465191138
they separated and d artagnan rushed between them like a dart   30.362759126113275
go   209.12764184596347
now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated monsieur de beaufort   130.34501174608775
stay my dear count said danglars   39.102602006166265
blood washes out dishonor said morrel   159.133841898661
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years   111.15062992384708
dantès your health   242.19602595604454
and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich   176.9975594654661
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains   135.70370992764862
she then opened the door of her alcove and went out   113.07975040030807
exactly so   121.09051619044165
the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me   132.70923251637907
upon my word   136.17102029553578
gondy smiled the queen s color rose and mazarin grew even paler   7.005700737136465
i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue   210.18224457712492
you are in a hurry   28.606493552350656
said he which meant do you see him   147.69001118066444
the king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw athos and aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks   133.9970867954472
the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen   89.71836000576656
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do   98.8086939340442
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong   133.32293734073016
the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest   16.56598750648085
on   169.77391727424606
at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein   89.01151483743773
alone   171.652017980076
which you please monsieur   101.87638441841348
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled   144.5802068726046
seek him at once   178.23058418649262
after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound   77.96057790552314
but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead   78.72053261785705
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and château renaud   6.257222449023729
instantly monseigneur   72.23520097671687
no violence   93.39164251894846
his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear   30.431170458812588
d artagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance   36.79978232382307
fool that i was   53.35873213880285
bonacieux was at his door   102.9713125653251
one of your friends   209.18761915803816
just as they were sitting down to table m   32.21689585123211
yes my lord   134.97157741955607
it was assunta calling for help   83.07521007344397
said the young man in an almost joyful accent pressing monte cristo s hand with both his own   85.17631852803339
yes sir returned julie   1.940870050522534
what do you think of that albert   63.64229123524349
devil take me if i taste one of them   168.29845148362716
as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms   124.96361915345949
and as it is three months since you have been here and though distracted as you must be in your important occupations you have forgotten to pay me my rent as i say i have not tormented you a single instant i thought you would appreciate my delicacy   157.51718011901352
and is he still in love with the catalane   162.54738760665396
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole   31.564757060988512
well continued the count in a tone that made franz shudder this young gentleman is one of my friends this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself this young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger   46.514986108780036
from whom   75.6491082969954
not such as he is now represented broken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb   153.19527213452866
the little boat bounded over the waves like a nut shell   149.56165530620586
mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch   199.07666602438115
do you think then monsieur that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece   219.74437114656638
asked another musketeer without addressing anyone in particular but on the contrary speaking to everybody   70.45625099113803
haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes   172.19482666163202
meantime d artagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king   152.58872484982885
well at a few minutes to seven at a few minutes to seven   175.0162099943067
above all if as i suppose it is payable at sight   64.28257012770317
whom do you mean   207.57385885793272
this awakening you have given me   182.73639432679005
it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis   87.09887077280203
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence   217.17460269508655
we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again   187.6419763042703
he asked himself trembling more than the wind swayed cloth he was holding back   113.09036039922994
it was only poisoned to the abbé adelmonte   165.71848162388184
at one o clock then behind the luxembourg   102.20145598174386
i am luigi vampa shepherd of the san felice farm   232.67833775691028
asked athos   181.87982296093463
the door soon opened and the accused appeared   103.48466397494855
a flurry in stocks chapter 55   115.42068711705225
he has faith in his friends   28.01887690620515
nonsense   15.278433110398268
0023m alas sir in the most unexpected manner   96.28516840592341
cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen   224.14190746991278
this very day   130.04321406751143
silence   132.03751247897756
observed one of the bearers   137.484750665317
when the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze   59.705388914829136
silence about the queen above all or you will ruin everybody without saving yourself   124.37229162634131
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousin s with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required   163.4096561985991
and my hasty departure the cause of which they were unable to guess having aroused their suspicions i was arrested at the very moment i was leaving piombino   79.39754790553778
danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere   67.57553452606511
perhaps i am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to mazarin   113.11400976251592
what makes you think so   140.2953481098737
immediately he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion opened it with a key he had in his hand closed the door and disappeared while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder   46.6008749100215
alas your excellency is right replied bertuccio and god made this infant the instrument of our punishment   135.3738593852045
de morcerf as the officer fernand mondego   176.74080728182378
he was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him   83.26934732072942
bonacieux   215.69462042677208
why you are like no   78.61123438879363
i must not therefore tell you   85.1043266014877
asked he   146.17798508802497
but here i ll pay you for us two   136.36197783571657
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet   66.76835702713583
sire go leave france to its real master to him who acquired it not by purchase but by right of conquest   95.83564467216807
here he said take this pocket book   38.15375812696135
read it again dantès and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense   153.5320583718628
speak   210.64143574352966
i will assist you with all my heart monseigneur   159.53936996156136
being the last comer it was for me to make the first advances   148.43942143325404
an intervening elevation of land hid the light   182.7971023981725
two angelic faces   153.51515630092047
they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette   259.45631414687796
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty   70.45395996626999
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hôtel   48.146215789916894
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses   21.562118842079087
we should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed athos   248.19260808005438
indeed   138.30200836960555
laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty   172.6624562029305
cried mme   140.11042348853877
it is this sir said the king angrily that general cromwell has reached newcastle   139.4520227749797
there was no great cunning necessary   114.27214427062951
of whom   60.05633256371314
i pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of his grace lord buckingham   77.23338755486418
now athos   73.16543868527611
we are among the privileged ones   15.042404138441952
and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group   100.70196450208927
oh death death   39.93773232594192
de tréville generally held so sacred became in an instant the annex of the antechamber   282.22229739408203
but stop   119.45021293904783
to beg him to assist me in finding my wife   99.1537716221598
a woman could go up a ladder like that   127.08052878549081
then she looks upon you as a stranger   153.22087012554113
in that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in france at the convent of the carmelites at béthune   260.95508465182303
the poor girl under the caresses of d artagnan lifted her head   140.24810290331206
franz and albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated roman banker   99.6719369979201
and wherefore fire   183.39468943278803
true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you   56.80771967679606
the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie   88.4553380374752
oh   168.27704350796995
when i return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as a servant and upon your recommendation though he doesn t speak a word of french i take him into my service   71.92549168063745
however there are plenty in the world but you don t look in the right direction for them my lord   91.80054785540561
de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m   130.45119901871945
not one too many   121.64435983703062
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm   162.49165401534606
oh yes   139.45127167099596
but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercédès   63.30508443266416
no thank you   77.92071573820559
zounds   141.78688539113892
kitty s detention was not long   130.82169325093648
no i do not understand   95.36957416881846
no one must know this secret my dear but yourself   4.685495722546037
well pardieu   109.45937996523797
very good observed danglars after having read the paragraph   132.13917440810107
that if the astrologer in question made almanacs i would advise him not to buy one   85.96527625911922
don t you think so d artagnan   110.2588931401403
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres   46.83017523595778
the mother and daughter passed the night together   108.15272533237523
yes for it is like one   140.78979437070313
every five minutes albert took out his watch   72.25614709097121
i think i remember that you told me something of that kind   138.42133475831523
no sire for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity   154.27698059265884
that s quite as many as we shall want   203.23831355395697
yes   157.1372145037043
they are always the same   4.788406149019181
the cardinal took the queen s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips   128.3814649671323
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to himself   126.37209638173962
a friend   23.376624495478225
thank you   213.56444220756052
and i not at all said mousqueton   180.79874845481228
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each other s prudence   121.80492027047005
the opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent   169.11125018045027
good heavens   166.39396363590117
none sir replied the bandit you are as free as air   145.05487419843118
simply an acquaintance sir   93.7283873705658
what is there then behind this wall   118.92609297996601
why really the thing seems to me simple enough   150.4666332403503
if you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to god   109.77852782099237
you have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the queen   79.38382646042376
if monsieur chevalier would follow me   206.13196419065667
those must have been ten weary years   119.30671661643295
alas you will find it so yourself said aramis with a sigh   123.67668503306774
i may be found here therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along   158.121383988726
when at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath   45.67962549329518
really count replied franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world   157.9778142632269
well i have ten thousand for you   149.45899880532482
that ring is defiled d artagnan   136.21314636740115
and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone   109.86150067493034
1   188.5420984079887
then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old   88.98588746683681
poor fellow   179.67985379509383
good bye   57.987532471555
but in order to avenge herself she must be free   36.36618551883598
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin   23.378460710884482
count added mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof   82.34014489938679
still she felt her pulse and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain and for a short time she suffered less   136.88880694381163
alas   214.42655666276838
what end would that answer   102.43471938373783
but the mind of the procureur was made up   56.71746701396446
i confess it but pardon to every sin   109.55937915533485
will you examine them   98.61202761222465
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance   127.30825259339711
from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep   114.95748065216051
talking of captain leclere has not dantès given you a letter from him   139.1955499422716
the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame   71.94785365889426
i was three years old said haydée   28.803892679729117
lord wilmore resided in rue fontaine saint georges   142.15742281123661
i wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business i was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself   45.888469954213605
30107m ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained   95.69999490271351
but the hackney coach drove on and the head of neither mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband   159.55992210456333
said madame danglars   50.49782157763525
although athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress   123.17662271209991
i resisted   178.9437110789388
he returned to france with the epaulet of sub lieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a captain in 1823 during the spanish war that is to say at the time when danglars made his early speculations   93.82710800490528
she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide   47.11761600297818
i threw and i lost   166.3360298615082
i descended the staircase step by step   24.26284522474799
this letter was from my brother   134.6380038009041
at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound   168.22430858458117
you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either   68.05033912078486
laurence on his gridiron   92.46099297145906
you must make some reformation in that quarter   181.1065050695957
he rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window   151.9968441698637
the light had almost disappeared from the former   58.32202623414742
to poison   83.30590172653933
nevertheless you consent   222.57269028619004
i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence   128.54419728224306
returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him   86.79807721766835
arrested at compiegne they have been carried to rueil   30.729889733679997
one hour s rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man s bright anticipations   114.58212078440863
thank him then madame if you have any affection for me   153.10634967837004
didn t he speak of me in any way   177.02025053380262
you know i only refuse when the thing is impossible   170.88987764849412
said she   1.604823384690505
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash   149.55364215714246
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors   3.527801561428703
he had found the pates good the wine excellent   93.73044073586982
ah   48.632612100811826
after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy   205.31099169175098
he does not like eugénie sufficiently   199.826933076417
thanks my captain   154.56116828882523
valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served   195.81578562709836
said he   113.27215948006614
i give you his very words   187.0629708676001
if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel he was not mistaken maximilian started as if he had been electrified   83.40330039974528
sir no and i do not know what has become of him   122.23481863787279
one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting   70.36455213732148
there was still that diamond left which sparkles on your finger and which i had observed yesterday   13.981928269766769
and now why are you here   182.26432120498532
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him   92.69588572870936
you can change them idiot   17.068818285551558
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set   73.39306478147364
replied the king betraying some uneasiness   137.8383467569409
four in the king s room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered   26.453312426933778
then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated   116.44228437917236
the two musketeers were already there and were playing together   127.92872427533987
i will answer for it said bonacieux   108.9536204692747
oh   120.02799915075505
let us return to m   53.182815578663494
which treasure i bequeath and leave en   196.2213512884839
yes   59.739666844196535
which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned d artagnan   192.6982058763352
i have nothing to say that can not be said before all   95.93713829108786
oh cried andrea leaping with joy   98.44813307362531
but to dantès eye there was no darkness   134.51446378116475
but after that you will make short work with those fellows   124.99483478934867
that cursed man my evil genius whom i have always met with when threatened by some misfortune he who accompanied that horrible woman when i met her for the first time he whom i was seeking when i offended our athos he whom i saw on the very morning madame bonacieux was abducted   60.82283681116371
gallop fast planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left   84.1657459427835
i am not yet twenty one and eugénie is only seventeen   8.970644673326007
besides said the abbé god is merciful to all as he has been to you   166.5570256170403
speech failed her   149.64186143958275
only donna estafania   126.17171816741879
ah i see you are smiling   17.51016836515609
be friends said the tutor   153.23792846923013
you are most kind   125.77283403408948
this last apartment was a sort of dark room littered with papers   181.140954722689
and me too   227.5634703316043
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood   320.4606015452589
the thought was maddening and dantès threw himself furiously down on his straw   109.6891558763617
de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st   174.95126960280516
yes madame said the young man   55.51262513960471
sir when you have told me to obey an order did i ever answer let me see that order   113.16391511113882
for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need   52.07788781137096
he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine   175.59895340479875
another ten minutes about his daughter travelling with mademoiselle d armilly   118.5726345468705
monte cristo wrote i die murdered by the corsican benedetto my comrade in the galleys at toulon no   283.787351318006
and he left the chamber without once looking behind him   72.02313495988554
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description   87.14116370066941
here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks and produced eventually that shameful peace at the conclusion of which the prince was arrested   33.524631963335764
all falsehood is a mask   106.35903954770593
is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere   10.161648163534537
inquired maximilian in a faltering voice   24.050197830412642
go on then replied the count   228.27554017394857
in short what shall i say to you felton   161.33686666094232
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night   113.52366281288369
march   100.24730382270924
he exclaimed   34.98177080587527
in that respect unlike you my dear aramis for you are still the same   93.62047823848363
the bed was the only one in the apartment which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom   161.0597400733469
be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing   232.23265294283502
help   115.6108277400902
it is unnecessary we know each other so well   2.944949578591718
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès   81.58528512454949
how you manoeuvre my instructions count   46.544773263586734
in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majesty s shoulder   6.412539628039724
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting   127.60399009143715
he shall do what he wishes to do   165.8360109168678
the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed   157.9126384865172
said athos do you regret you have not shed our blood   110.79199572778855
i plainly tell you so replied aramis   70.08236131589823
they had been ushered into madame de villefort s room who had said she would receive them there   206.6510930711787
who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet   200.80066727183632
and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty   47.56681467408849
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it   109.42605784169987
he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by châteauroux clermont ferrand le puy and nîmes   72.53317112523851
ah said caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold   118.57645786560838
cried bonacieux   174.8246143022296
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues   94.32063261909153
what he had done you the honor to remain here   105.20124132247398
yes and no   78.44977435198692
he again ran back to the château   161.18261332970593
we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly   140.3500025413719
never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling   122.2194246197433
well but said aramis have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent   165.97248315753043
this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall   151.04795289015547
he shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the convent   178.32437007479183
but i am ignorant   16.130674018008648
three weeks   277.4298479794894
at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements   169.68190077973304
ah young man young man some flirtation or other   205.4071812419279
beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf   122.37334118434207
very well replied m   57.554071521061736
do you hesitate   53.53546450695967
cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea   79.58068580235376
and i du barthois added porthos   79.4964081633053
whence came the blow   154.53607997651778
on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet   127.75807799080572
the answer was terrible   119.33555776687439
but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary and i no longer have them   25.18062241369394
and he is in paris   159.28838574543303
as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general s words   56.77492514789151
oh   108.15567430436235
the devil   86.93309026456133
franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud   152.98934399790525
but be of good courage my lad   85.96934168766828
that letter was everything   60.420242975722935
the drums beat   73.49387883555673
but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said raoul   212.87851656089035
i felt pain   182.86448279779518
he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble   28.186975673661763
yes said the major i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye   92.80699362037836
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine   148.2166316794122
d artagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense   216.78945553890574
i require my lord that normandy should be given to madame de longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution   155.29194160910572
shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walkers   112.71725881872636
no no   161.0695488673744
albert is ten minutes after time   139.77742964368775
milady listened   61.250481433566925
i have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what i have just witnessed   198.64082743735543
you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence   209.0003312941391
i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of second rate fortunes   49.0704123764386
valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart   102.63535286980236
athos never received any letters   206.4339359954806
what do you mean to say   80.39029045123908
said morrel   188.08810222512744
most assuredly   145.35442983785728
unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the duc de beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action   175.22020980862442
he was a picard whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge tournelle making rings and plashing in the water   103.45340201378625
asked the queen well madame replied the valet i followed them as far as the gates   19.71560120918906
when one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under it   90.30687449798438
well what is it   185.14705144025677
but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond   85.22889083511356
bricconi   302.5472907729271
his task was the more difficult as there was no board to support him   149.0542181934609
cried d artagnan   116.69249135373883
about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage   157.79695557485582
and was this lady young and handsome   73.63757106775657
sir   57.28881292293621
then said d artagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal   142.05767994633132
the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his self control change color once or twice   106.06896407220205
the queen was still standing when he entered   134.59442526822176
but i know he must be so at present   46.17085414612711
this was the more so because bonacieux s reflections were all rose colored   193.72728645855892
as for the count he just touched the dishes   203.8830016448204
write to him   124.89886099878599
3 he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity   113.25114855621925
baptistin left the room   124.85027686153583
as you please sir said caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trap door in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen   107.28036539439543
deuce take it   85.60931225171835
thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy   184.0420383249825
then taking out his watch he added it is half past eleven   114.56185615142587
could you engage to bring him to me to morrow morning at ten o clock on the pont du louvre   42.11167938319056
if so he will have achieved a noble work   83.69445134855026
but cried the young officer speak then speak   201.87556507984664
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publisher s office   94.72790408735162
he returned to london at the first sound of war   137.42081944421193
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord   88.23426050253013
they then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants   121.99428190949615
i could kill an ox with a blow of my fist   96.54545158752475
no not that way i beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the hall   98.86023672848489
finally he slept   85.98522135152771
at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together   108.66537197253456
alas my dear aramis said d artagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are relating   48.02482701304989
there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence   106.29709966539781
and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the marais for having for so long a time lived near the place royale lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling   100.46884941440273
the place royale   201.81529123897178
ah my god   81.66982464697435
he flew from the apartment and morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door   118.7894215037999
and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother   139.90647046553173
the house you purchase is at auteuil   112.01795106036546
he said to the executioner raising his long locks   135.12811719308445
but the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire   143.1251658633915
that is a strange question said aramis   19.216918734825796
and as for your poor arm what difference will that make   84.05660755775787
you may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion   95.05388189678953
no my lord madame has visitors   62.26471217137075
i repent of it   41.55676359376159
said athos   234.64322524134155
but how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage   75.38169662548735
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy   98.06613057935488
but d artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship   126.12599293919814
but i see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home   21.06321224307088
that is not probable   89.2841634690254
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service   155.77324144768966
milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind   93.67219546713925
the wife of athos chapter xxviii   176.76106681947635
the pretty mme   114.121897304004
they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass   35.98500869339159
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions   117.11344774060105
good   103.83379325849116
will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment for of all this i have the proofs   159.86840286088292
d avrigny or without speaking to the procureur   160.4895134753008
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth   138.01793640352483
and you will please to accept the word of monsieur d artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle   136.31839869867466
i say your troops for i presume that you gentlemen are frondeurs   132.52721951567318
how so   140.81610439022165
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril   115.16847092390515
a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms   102.57186881996039
all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended   137.03081275161568
he is   123.23388074208242
by its influence time has no longer measure space has no longer distance   110.18332629126606
he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady   36.800659419236695
said she   193.68409546572042
oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars   111.70270009230435
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long   107.10739475580336
0148m eh pardieu   113.61339639148287
the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest   226.6018948742587
madame said d artagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him   78.53255676406064
i know all these things   91.21082673151648
i had but one gerfalcon and he died day before yesterday   71.73660053931633
come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed   134.933297460677
here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner   182.98401904630626
although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends   111.44328849195125
but you will not follow me   191.31251635413383
the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven o clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named   208.35542808300593
and two or three times i fancied that i had heard it before   75.60778870316568
de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy   29.88180911901216
there said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which i have taken an oath should be buried with me   46.49140209834705
this evening said the governor   108.74002695725437
she murmured   108.9873758891751
repeated porthos   61.611889096622164
upon a word from her i would betray my country i would betray my king i would betray my god   183.88595524677623
he went to him   222.71862434809788
but mazarin is a low born rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an archer   113.84577567992795
she lived in the place royale then the fashionable quarter at number 6 and he undertook to call and take d artagnan with him in order to introduce him   134.16459055532067
what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth   92.11382975663273
he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy   83.69805301550568
yes certainly   109.51091649459697
you are mistaken monsieur i replied   42.410161565377294
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood   9.316228778275402
you know it do you not   62.172704110027865
and he fell back on the bed   208.976530908445
what is the amount   148.84888674024774
look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which m   195.67871298045873
they will not touch a hair of your head   145.97676891685677
general de quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took   218.49170933407257
i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria   73.8466188042602
i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king   126.14315016160836
and what has happened to you my dear porthos   181.88363226031646
he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle   141.39381371165007
and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of rochefort   98.07214486362679
asked comminges   21.087073118344733
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act   119.45574463713295
indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever   123.92964436627992
change these lackeys said he   34.16716320495867
porthos followed chatting with aramis   89.36668832112508
but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come   162.03646283418223
it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth i must confess   44.219847095290035
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise   128.27693912615047
go and bow to her   2.2354972094563834
he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest i strike you behind   104.49455796868756
when   225.33596841265353
and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man s shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size   210.3847216651276
asked the queen almost timidly   105.32682038310132
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen   131.2865075966364
with the four hundred livres we will make the half of one for one of the unmounted and then we will give the turnings out of our pockets to d artagnan who has a steady hand and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to   229.16973035764022
listen now to what i say in this my dying moment   185.61837852463296
i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure   117.00922210230921
gracious heaven exclaimed he   146.1317655646465
she will repent and no one will know that she has been guilty   131.3516805069446
your eminence is right   162.22169968396116
death raps at your door it enters it goes not blindfolded but circumspectly from room to room   65.0707488746535
the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation   91.7464737685629
milady breathed again   147.72490749739646
nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start   218.36998537295528
9   223.34590185263602
marseilles resounded with their well earned praises   235.08406793879337
they were in earnest conversation   64.13944444804126
asked debray in a whisper of madame danglars   29.78300530940018
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition   64.90888669884322
why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the temple of friendship as the poets would say   36.93285604555301
said d artagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts athos i can not imagine how you can talk to us in that way   109.0176298898934
chapter lxxiv   52.20708380666103
follow me monsieur said mazarin   242.9614961000138
the four friends saw all this not a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them   142.13763988854467
we must go out   155.53120120493023
the skiff lightning   132.51389903680658
it was his token reserved for the morrow   87.62468760899462
sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure   54.17842568711345
it is he   30.10702437563765
d artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet   43.466551949285474
go on urged caderousse   140.85106192547752
40036m she pointed to each letter of the alphabet   7.117199765961885
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions   100.70905978137816
come then let us go to your friend s house   203.81300703361893
at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room   166.2210215006747
yes he checks his pace   240.56400367706544
take care returned albert   124.59145442004379
i can go no farther   231.1929628740668
i know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested   53.226986427516124
i thought as much said d artagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts   161.2720030052863
you mean a mischance   107.93669481312163
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period   141.4757440877554
villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught   36.577845601951864
cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend s entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to rita s father at frosinone   99.98181667210574
isn t mousqueton there   82.42189650654319
no cried porthos   140.88440278550522
ah here you are monsieur she said in her naturally calm voice   137.29586732490444
is the king dead   134.65301746762555
how monsieur   163.11216241695186
i say that it was you who gave me the wine   217.26193855776427
well said the queen it has been refused   30.760783140695793
never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering   159.44281653326453
i say why is the king taken prisoner   92.28973298223268
well no madame this is the terrible news i have to tell you said villefort in a hollow voice no nothing was found beneath the flowers   136.89051380655272
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor   254.96821839538882
they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances   153.11414063859107
his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them   52.855409535774584
you may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city   211.12721873394258
what is the matter   21.68595838374752
he left paris more than six weeks ago and is believed to have gone on a mission to england   96.60196086767151
the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men   66.89164574716956
do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead   203.6423155227647
my name is ah   83.97016417757857
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune   109.40125270587728
villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence   62.072889553811926
i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsed but there will be a conference to morrow and we shall see   159.96859300873598
how do you know it   101.3442497285235
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered   235.17471674271837
well sir i am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me   75.32252863197942
hold sire said d artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep   121.93485408301876
planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase   46.32727695349199
why   96.02219299106495
but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor   60.56090883209815
cried d artagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man   98.60664923827305
and embracing his father and nodding to caderousse he left the apartment   47.339286728788025
where that is true said blaisois   92.23579420880074
morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry   134.8904602776464
cried mousqueton reddening with joy   222.87995755598345
i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request   131.2849020602166
now you get angry and attack our poor agents   165.8512840889886
de tréville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus   38.45299791325749
really captain said d artagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french   275.5282618037287
i am listening   135.0443142177973
i am not mistaken   99.7908913972947
that letter is not lost   86.73356241881683
and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation   204.37106857567701
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses worth 32 000 francs to madame danglars   140.96123813696187
thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen   159.64513864007557
in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone   157.76686073039843
these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust   146.06296722059403
demanded d artagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering it   207.06938697381094
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes   137.94135298937942
the poor woman reclined where she had been left half fainting upon an armchair   99.0787092511295
and where does he come from   52.95581678081551
from this point everything was a blank to dantès he knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned   92.86419008125883
i was at the end of my journey and of my credit   47.61253662590468
should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you no said monte cristo   149.58253393439256
look at the comte de la fere a type of nobility a flower of chivalry   95.27991781438867
madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself   16.10830328919775
to this preoccupation of his vanity d artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish   72.43062019740385
a ray of joy passed across m   95.98413415776938
but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantès return on a mission of vengeance   144.52213606358646
but alas   52.70357034484634
and these researches   93.51039160000272
both had recently come into the country   170.6668536589988
i believe you said mme   129.92124509535964
only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes   113.37849530297834
oh what imprudence my lord said d artagnan   153.44668565198174
emmanuel returned my sister the house of morrel can only be carried on by a morrel   100.32044268447619
had a real liking for tréville a royal liking a self interested liking it is true but still a liking   222.84162181558935
oh maximilian how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness   151.7271036071286
honoré and in the place du palais cardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades   107.21008195404751
that s all   155.95233453323357
it was now his turn to look about him   116.80607533611212
doubtless doubtless said morrel   156.50009486241134
two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to them   56.75817136798981
get on   143.4899907241678
he accepts said monte cristo   72.06181249810297
inquired d artagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief   85.15738009195266
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation   167.84042930800004
it had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the scottish commander   139.8148094333393
on the contrary they thought it very timely   137.95357911424978
he exclaimed as though a red hot iron were piercing his heart   70.43326681525215
the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword   102.27415804611196
help   101.64001159783646
then she picked up friquet   214.47757208849526
devil take them   119.83552696593675
there were four musketeers on the bottom steps amusing themselves with the following exercise while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport   151.83969980307955
caderousse   32.82268731559782
well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die i shall require nothing   108.06903714992404
we hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the académie des inscriptions et belles lettres if we should not succeed a very probable thing by the by in gaining admission to the académie française with our own proper pack   98.98043792583482
the tocsin was sounded   24.634575668623995
but only her   91.18159521973935
one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne   70.18260387529651
ah if i were in your place said albert   160.23887022856084
and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia   105.27316991349173
but sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon   130.02979537495762
chapter 14   148.5558085402101
whilst all this was going on athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st   174.8947754755459
good evening m   56.74414773151269
let us do better than that said athos   197.68285912383863
and i can t travel on my savings for in my twenty two years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts   211.31030236912105
namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown   144.40943251262118
quite the contrary planchet   106.61063726336229
said planchet with his shrewd air   121.94325023803388
you would take your gun you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog   21.344341277328326
i am always afraid of a quarrel when i am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it   206.5274612677901
that s my advice   203.97700574678518
parry was not wrong   136.87456434838595
and then said aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in god what is the use of thinking of it all   72.48357357247276
but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap   30.2564286819958
chapter 43   169.26517872229965
de villefort s   106.04251197490512
madame danglars rose suddenly   48.78245509160932
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved   9.357274330095422
inquired albert   142.80007124067373
but believe me that man has other projects   107.11589135329332
and andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the man s hand leaped lightly on to the pathway   158.49891342483025
said the cardinal   181.04703477011438
not an instant to be lost   48.7006989307132
e   98.48323685636684
you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder   168.53683879152018
gentlemen said athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together   129.36561375839543
de villefort was therefore obliged to request m   98.17887955354014
yes   122.96391516060557
that s my masterpiece   3.545160660992707
dear valentine said morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen i entreat you   150.57161694740918
whew   246.2995705068775
i am more your friend than you think for after our very first encounter i could by saying a word to the cardinal have had your throat cut   198.5127096694469
inquired winter   89.26881994719209
no more do i and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now   146.86835101454704
no one has been able to accomplish that   142.27409282282196
de boville   111.89432238011635
and her name is countess g   58.15428594335681
i think he has only been introduced to madame de villefort   15.889669351997256
each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people   168.41218519085243
an infallible one   183.16607101132286
the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity   101.06563786140222
this miserable strain confines me to my bed   194.98298642217884
the duke smiled   164.7010443184863
de château renaud   187.32943214390332
dantès was about to speak   44.60842092671872
and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness   95.95485774886457
in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him   123.96779984910832
did we not swear friendship   68.13045589601995
bertuccio bowed and left the room   114.6925892665296
we are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass   86.3196836913897
this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim   219.6099969523105
so replied de winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that white skin and that languishing look have not yet seduced you you heart of stone   139.43536152837038
if not her husband he is unquestionably her lover   114.31951412200635
30303m and what are his claims to the peerage   173.14258602764386
the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world   101.89977239911106
but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet   151.7486339306721
oh if he knows the contents of this   113.67283556248138
where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked   80.6453287729233
1   120.7034585903194
oh yes more than once but always in vain   116.15417058114058
well my dear sir said danglars to fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy   55.267392108627654
the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed   204.59721943052602
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts   122.88252782368427
athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula i make you a knight   155.40382250607968
said the queen   18.675415335829882
planchet emboldened by the first exploit sprang upon lubin   84.24917221761163
and even what i am sure of   78.75098628849805
perhaps some accident has happened to him   113.88270954187023
and i can set out immediately   137.16447612653582
they both exclaimed at once   132.39061938212424
explain it athos   170.4283021445347
said aramis   178.8787590503788
the plan adopted by d artagnan was soon perfected   146.79016178255154
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety   134.606420311626
monsieur de nargonne was a baron and my name is hermine   69.14835572288592
gutenberg   47.75179994260972
you know he is almost dumb   150.24928677696218
i listen   97.8241712603385
i never once doubted your doing so   51.09359958136338
defend yourself   127.34914611541835
the next day they stopped at the hôtel de flandre at brussels   89.1014140412973
i have answered for you   64.22167166457433
these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him   157.99205165092133
it was noirtier the lemonade was intended for it is noirtier logically speaking who drank it   64.39396243035245
your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor   121.61457865401898
oh good lord   105.97538137205377
to all the simple things which escaped our gascon milady replied with a smile of kindness   84.88513513919634
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again   145.27898837469718
i am just falling down with fatigue   171.33612435614657
the two men turned round and saw morrel standing at the door pale and terror stricken   49.94555705207544
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed   90.14546386481754
is in fact unlimited said monte cristo   43.72045074133335
and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef   197.7025229022012
then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and d artagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what i should say to it   34.03856834591916
oh yes i know what sort of vengeance   91.22946242933313
i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the château d if   187.71865406970178
you remember what a beautiful night it was   165.35714710438836
you did not see   218.04459682813896
louvieres was proud and satisfied   40.91001101635656
do you know him   0.08821790872102042
a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people   142.04971649278906
monsieur d artagnan said the commissary addressing athos declare all that passed yesterday between you and monsieur   13.40214744592798
and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name   26.425113578342803
is what true madame   32.40448507710424
d artagnan sprang back   156.14044871055142
he cried are the prisoners still there   166.73467498011888
it was many years since d artagnan had opened his heart to any one   73.39364277870473
generous girl   45.255628922485386
the president paused and the count turned pale   216.12074624902615
all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen   102.10852612216308
at their ball   78.27196682100474
sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other men i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings   78.33224314799544
the pharaon   193.62711483671296
i lost him then with all his appointments and furniture   126.5556708595123
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent   135.94943201302704
come come gentlemen said mordaunt impatiently let us depart   50.52470578924951
never i swear to you   152.32281421066148
he asked himself   1.518514913568083
i thought he had seen me at work   165.3841775676832
monseigneur said he my life is yours   42.57785167217507
he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death   160.56424397545743
there were no questions   71.32784602793575
yes that was it said d artagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue eyes   224.17818049361938
but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord   158.8543784911553
hem said monte cristo in his turn   160.60961436206702
at tréport   106.91707100755961
he had fired them himself and had killed two men   86.85172222006295
albert retained his calm and indifferent manner   237.81989418514337
then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton   229.30223814144938
the taking of la rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the edict of nantes   196.19046939425863
nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you   56.56409751374289
yes if i die   155.81407217311428
you will come off splendidly at those two exercises   97.96100373180882
alas murmured edmond   79.83826505845633
now he said to teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be   266.6336134793411
and if he is killed well he will die bravely   88.19163063501094
let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped suggested raoul   217.40602873116512
bah said andrea a little overcome by the solemnity of bertuccio s manner why not   103.00962486703968
mme   115.15989612532104
valentine seized the count s hand   169.18939977226452
less quickly than the women it seems to me replied porthos   140.32501239063146
we traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking   131.41745783794238
de villefort how would you advise me to act   211.09902255714147
the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter which although it might be very instructive would certainly afford our readers but little amusement   226.48433106795622
oh monsieur said caderousse make one more attempt try me once more   38.45355642252903
when i say i will not do a thing i mean it   197.85423936508093
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain   241.5205235087436
the count has an unlimited credit upon me   93.86050288336467
she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely   168.92219634502268
you see plainly i can not walk   202.77511215217476
d artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step   48.57447169300366
the carriage drove on and d artagnan availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner   128.24656719828582
do you know what gave him strength   244.82137571765972
what the truly guilty   92.81679554285736
faubourg saint germain said château renaud   177.18784294304132
i don t understand it at all   111.52789229377292
but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply   95.56987913116308
and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables   82.99899344778541
monsieur du vallon i commend his eminence to your care   196.32971969791808
do you know what they are saying here   88.47605223823815
cried monte cristo thrusting his hands into his hair   166.85763101842994
mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m   119.3051527150013
you will find that it is as good as another   188.60459158238226
then a fearful crash was heard   216.49051598915656
comte de la fere you wish to perish by his hands   81.87609755143095
morrel looked around uneasily   238.10414391321524
at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before   1.8809928258796162
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage   194.05899858410757
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye   59.77458280696103
and what do you know about them monsieur   102.80217407338114
this evening then at nine o clock   8.436025603347701
yes   97.44280781359086
you are mistaken   238.7890616299956
maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word   114.41804221410246
20299m we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him   144.62845169026627
the inspector kept his word with dantès   94.00870493391659
let us try not to jest if we can   97.67653428932242
but unfortunately those were all good pieces   170.38717625426682
oh sire what an idea   114.3970771552154
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts   76.06112758335166
20045m and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson french who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have mentioned   157.1721497610593
cried dantès letting his chisel fall to the floor   193.02780869019574
all the nobility of rome will be present and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society she must go there   212.8617681000144
inquired a turnkey   272.70957826099516
what shall we do   134.93954461720017
on entering the court of his hôtel buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestibule   88.59321402374644
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel   166.08155705841665
we must go replied villefort offering his arm   47.73444710479505
the rain of blood as the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glance but there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened   198.3046140516046
my dear friend said albert to beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning   161.14984467140292
it was m   140.49123197181416
you see then felton i can do nothing but die   186.3001189176274
what says augustine on this subject severus sit clericorum verbo   120.63531726315146
as to m   216.99575259983223
so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne   163.7764941259718
adieu paris adieu   167.68056744248543
it might be imagined that he was a hundred miles from the capital   159.760817411021
before that is expired some idea will occur to me   53.40024959929707
the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen   185.0316116487207
you can now have confidence in me after what i have done   302.71002861684644
but said porthos if he was not crushed completely ah   95.8199578897603
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere   87.69622582722621
but d artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m   39.155531193573424
he was a man of execution this worthy porthos   18.20800899659494
the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first   72.19379007762139
the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell   140.57411109277464
besides what is there astonishing when you think of the grief i ought to be in that i shut myself up   97.39533480770969
who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school and moreover added he sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars   57.918634918921434
yes his mother   80.78638905580985
asked the count   71.76341349711872
at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin s wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and caderousse uttered a cry of pain   89.78712394400715
my word said de winter rising i think the hussy is going mad   113.51673800895011
b   143.07653024424596
well said villefort what then   179.80254728274448
what do you mean by a struggle   188.92381760779193
asked anne of austria with a movement of impatience   142.16147289393675
then in order not to hinder you i will get up with you if you please in your carriage and tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow   64.75779271604729
and i said athos am returning to bragelonne   89.08689399944497
and what is it to be   146.3105786005838
edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content   47.36186790890481
but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of 500 francs per annum paid quarterly   98.40959379368184
i am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the puritans   136.15266519111017
there was a magic effect in the count s words which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man   137.95021866578625
where were they taken   90.97469052027961
sir said planchet i am in all things at your service   55.834167887926064
and wherefore should they do so   125.99588034163723
and in that strange manner they approached the louvre   79.40052982110262
yes you are right   158.91967516563082
but this confession concerns me only   60.69816121162479
but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette   102.55597989730803
jackson replied buckingham   87.4134805535188
de villefort for which i am quite at a loss to account   96.5403663853525
monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it   54.75882456744422
what is it   52.16566482351617
but at night   62.987958932374035
but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives himself   90.55280077683031
yes   122.48659424807012
i doubt it my lord   116.68326603849503
and why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me   33.696526677234544
at this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed   117.12853834234257
asked milady   80.70806387649384
does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day   103.55285565411764
bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know aramis   86.9312721149985
the weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful   45.06614772705328
you mean to take your horse   161.38050229853306
i obtain the letter and i run directly to the cardinal   148.18514763757995
said the latter   65.6300960930586
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her chamber   207.70775110807375
four men carried me from paris to châlons walking six leagues a day   111.479813769282
gentlemen i am young scarcely twenty three years old   130.51690420976473
i promise you my lord never to part with it replied athos   131.08416483192835
my valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out   3.441028808525516
fortunately monsieur d artagnan is in our hands and you shall be confronted with him   145.7717856873781
franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude   122.50569924218891
albert rejoined his mother   114.5194001856062
by the side of andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence and who had been appointed by the court for andrea disdained to pay any attention to those details to which he appeared to attach no importance   141.50622562261398
0097m as he had now arrived at the door of his own house which adjoined the palais de justice he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the spot where villefort had left him   57.47906044180051
give up this letter you have brought from elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your friends   219.39260052470468
yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold   104.36903888356856
not the least in the world   145.1767594522644
he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as i am i seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors   129.89084267017088
a woman   156.41377572525073
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme   5.192554077680839
the horses started on a trot and took the road to the louvre which they entered   120.73560726716626
replied raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life   107.68172937426489
the hostess replied only by gasps   146.84058547056787
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it   152.40430130791435
this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it she implored the captain to put her on shore   73.37510862503362
this guide was our friend peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road   99.4268464112691
i am under his orders for the next month   86.59494858237403
anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me   159.4608361302651
said kitty   72.46303798697608
the principal charge against you is this letter and you see villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed   59.35970543842189
boulevard de l opéra said beauchamp   107.30780118773653
that would be very good   88.6336455085642
every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village   102.97854882942568
the one m   147.75737243221863
a young man   162.82366820785523
albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness   112.52798499410297
milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her heart   111.79544540975212
if he were rich if he had cavalcanti s fortune that might be pardoned   132.6937276171521
they will treat you as a deserter i warn you   100.03157307326457
when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men   90.2598121189215
they ask my name i can not give it since my parents abandoned me   191.96684308072585
said danglars   76.94908957122841
albert was not deceived for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner   159.73108183720967
to how much   222.06280349346412
what do i want   101.86720230699682
cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive   135.74772362886796
your excellency may depend upon me   18.281229287669817
i trust to him from my heart   182.89231558925417
really did they   144.936226731515
nobody will think of us and for my part i am greatly fatigued   149.95062413241223
why that s impossible   50.549785244929566
yes said athos and the marechal has often told me so himself   138.53430324268868
and you to whom are you devoted now   98.00455154450432
and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will   140.02937612291458
he had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not   105.91954089028363
in short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not accustomed   131.6645207205428
in that respect my dear friend it s delightful   112.61933975433598
he had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort   162.43873555727436
yes   84.1545304121108
do you believe it   40.2312114203029
yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide   146.17065487760763
the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness   164.83463446868154
said the young girl sorrowfully   53.961079822524034
but extraordinary to relate the father did not say thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father   64.02391234820777
the rest of the dinner was to come   202.70823469817697
20353m the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed   111.9375417680174
he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human   27.04896046227833
this second signature explained everything to franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment   221.0541837992529
then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket   142.6691355622703
d artagnan was standing at the door looking after porthos with a mournful gaze when the baron after walking scarcely more than twenty paces returned stood still struck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed i recollect   175.66397673673976
but my lord if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man   154.5864655611941
by that plain arrangement of the hair by that costume of extreme simplicity by the brow polished like marble and as hard and impenetrable she recognized one of those gloomy puritans she had so often met not only in the court of king james but in that of the king of france where in spite of the remembrance of the st   79.45486719977686
ah   18.76046415586518
i used to play almost every night in france   184.5213399562739
where he fell   217.17218151268443
good day sirs said the duke advancing   97.079447663945
indeed count said morrel shuddering   131.37218655568287
that is not all resumed lord de winter   27.56836785059437
they both alighted   158.82640406556527
why do you mention my father   154.8745184478268
gaspard caderousse   103.50519301208917
it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance   156.90676941401108
and pray what was this quarrel about   224.50011216047864
i want you to spare time to take a walk with me   113.46469963522934
federal laws and your state s laws   191.67133582268536
it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the banker s as the betrothed   71.90036847454877
ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad   71.4214805186414
i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background   111.14382450411117
take care of the executioner d artagnan   74.8501468489689
the notary bowed   194.80244404372075
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo   135.0689835498426
ah i am an unfortunate king monsieur de tréville   27.021695059569822
leave us germain said villefort   208.41060126048552

and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers   138.6283532334453
the guards were unable to help any one each one was occupied with his self preservation   268.41649678595786
for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive   89.14857014349964

my dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box   114.02791125390131
why it was he who spoke to me sir said dantès with a smile   144.6164932752575
the people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them   26.543292636433108
no   93.49572949734917

villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m   177.23060205921496
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance   172.15863591811808

the cemetery of the château d if on the bed at full length and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form   86.7640525443678
the sultans and viziers who rule over society there and who constitute what in france we call the government are really haroun al raschids and giaffars who not only pardon a poisoner but even make him a prime minister if his crime has been an ingenious one and who under such circumstances have the whole story written in letters of gold to divert their hours of idleness and ennui   111.46670793690348

asked the baron rising and going a step backward   61.86110657427329
yes   105.40936216434376
dantès meanwhile went on his way   113.10664815424866
if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality   104.13198668937109

the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row   154.55942302533833
athos put his arm around aramis s neck and embraced him   2.500041478183661
it required all villefort s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him   229.9845742820027
are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired franz from the viscount of morcerf   186.48523299162332

athos then said to aramis   106.83543546106952
bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her   73.40575947385156
the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fish for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat   78.32027434331181

is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for   130.09200470235436
for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven   113.08781108898847

the guard obeyed   94.44110459551676
danglars riveted attention eugénie s composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair   46.21320527299986
he would shoot dantès and then kill himself   83.36087436801306

but the woman left last night and the man this morning   85.09711544648356
yes   146.07877689194822
said monte cristo putting the light near his face   100.7555700130257
and from that moment she has followed your steps watched you feared you and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes m   108.1613578874754
adieu sir   73.79444923433607
hope   114.04478919992694
m   64.33136774924691
she was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as raphael was fond of and titian has painted all his magdalens with   52.559910386607456
yes   240.50925556081035
zounds   167.01429756631944
there   72.28119007164902
but i perceive i have not much to teach you   113.84457686559065
that is he   92.06816391130545
well that was a temptation for two wretches like you   97.18841281793527
we have but ill defended him it remains for us to save him   86.5295246857877
but i arrived second and must sail first   80.141011254832
debray has made me lose 700 000 francs   150.21194652343067
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words   170.2319581626693
look   81.65312453399739
no sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious   115.00439483771402
besides make yourselves easy   170.80354795881271
this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it   96.9586257651753
in execution   54.64766112403713
and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse   157.08998412686836
they make the countess ill   166.03828268604894
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows   132.38821941293605
and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man   101.5542232649452
what you say is full of sense replied d artagnan   90.92700857934246
not a modern picture among them   100.98491127104064
i will go continued maximilian i will seek m   136.41657112264434
the bastion was guarded   138.70516409541156
often before his captivity dantès mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers   150.21716320884886
oh really   162.04397309488576
through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was to change his dress for that of a workman slip out with his deliverers pass the sentinels who would suspect nothing and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at greenwich   102.01519210598319
all is well   140.53724272084884
a person whose confessor i am replied he and who entertains a high regard for me applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant   109.75651025248143
it is all a matter of imagination   11.296795471604383
chapter xiv   165.68359239399314
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people   126.01692400482723
but said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred   84.33812863210755
he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking   91.76616216021134
ah   147.22683016395473
he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight   199.48488517522566
on the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular excavation   22.253314262784357
and pray how do you know that   101.43556221844803
get me out of this in heaven s name   175.91833794339837
but this woman is a friend of aramis i know nothing of that   74.58154923406575
cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning   147.4068142062493
yes it s all my fault because it is myself who selects my men   174.77344296503847
has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin   71.59359076368077
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand   84.99757519771454
they knew all they wished to know   112.14727525866012
through the darkness franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated   242.58017326023406
where am i   144.94322382529185
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price   224.12106531222443
at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory   164.79183240128012
it is possible haydée that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the east may not be practicable in paris   92.12533720676095
you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz   52.90503758047065
ah sir said the minister of police to villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by luck s door your fortune is made   93.00803169712663
let it come said athos   110.857678120555
women are very indiscreet my sister   158.05486121590218
de villefort   169.54944111913602
but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day   293.5863349285115
acknowledge that if albert is brave he can not be a coward   126.96370901816113
as athos and aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle   157.56372438468054
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate   57.718740221693224
suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks fell upon athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear silence   40.591348811194536
don t you agree with me aramis   64.83677275322599
well then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied   161.9721251282886
it is no business of mine   77.5791545602656
we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued maximilian   184.48099981204945
certainly   36.470509554278465
therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by d artagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to d artagnan that he should marry her   212.88508983899825
then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room   138.053515417717
demanded monte cristo   166.363045479979
the son of a shipowner   26.401224948847187
we loved sporting of all kinds better than anything   187.9035102822666
continued the count in french it is necessary to excite this man s confidence   51.57237870192385
there was then amongst that crowd a moment s hesitation which looked like shame   140.53840446080432
then sleep here my dear count   154.74604157543297
but four hundred what   147.1404048734794
even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you can not well mistake him   69.35293220286741
the friends embraced cordially   211.96549331725703
i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease   81.72840172397665
if the emperor remained on the throne gérard required a different alliance to aid his career   194.17667002995458
tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny morrel to pray sometimes for a man who like satan thought himself for an instant equal to god but who now acknowledges with christian humility that god alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom   88.97029765739413
grimaud bazin mousqueton and planchet   100.78870238484265
that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight   104.26334801539464
wretch   164.659145807569
faith   147.1206812693589
tell me cried villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection   88.34688550577593

he is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the chamber of peers with a uniform   93.67191072735777
morrel in person   6.371084417700999
and in a separate group might be distinguished m   209.5896866788226
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities   102.74484752867517
well responded porthos you may imagine with the physique with which nature has endowed me i am not in want of good luck   95.5221031978797
i observed cannon on the road   61.307873698637145
what in the devil does he say   94.92908909286083
yes said harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table   8.820138862568243
you would have believed yourself about to meet friends   148.96304770076264
left alone she arose   113.73506837448441
de tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon d artagnan   137.19586466241867
the carnival at rome   94.68503579491953
mazarin wished to approach her   143.30185567874796
then you can let me have some money can you not   97.94015218939052
to me to a brother   192.01778586499123
only do not allow me to be insulted   194.66286724505198
again the abbé smiled   62.96333086254606
said d artagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of devotion   33.17624002120647
cried madame de villefort it is really frightful   229.53314087449763
and i mine   106.5160128769388
with the queen i double her risk   117.61291586266616
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully   122.21426528446447
isn t that what you would have me shout   107.33744084041271
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel   174.69519008303115
madame de villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bed curtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of valentine   141.97138039595558
ah if poor mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction   161.53913064556724
well what is the matter my dear   72.43315595158668
mazarin rose   84.55166013866064
put him to death   63.599222312844674
i confess i am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in italy justice is only paid when silent in france she is paid only when she speaks   70.34294541935053
no   19.171922653566796
yes mademoiselle you especially replied the doctor abruptly   293.36725313455884
he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable and when the fourth begins takes his departure   87.2085309347391
it was very hard   76.41519621022402
the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall   155.27674683422566
nothing   156.45745932956268
all this is perhaps folly perhaps insanity   73.38761631035399
for by this time she must have quit the shores of france   114.41945650130306
said milady in a voice broken by sobs   152.4664678325417
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve o clock   182.08340974338114
i recognize them said morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own signature   112.97680275837989
aramis whom we have sent for   137.58441070486043
you must advise me what to do   169.9674956024753
he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i and you   98.66356337193271
but the king is with mazarin   97.71057191374322
i thought you might want it to show the abbé busoni   32.35706098050039
edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with years and can not now remind my edmond by a smile or by a look of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating   42.87487575342786
be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke   61.724489892156456
he thought of what was in store for his poor horses   40.50215624823092
the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward   53.59130749238769
like monsieur pixérécourt   101.89375723454023
your profession   0.6810832532289055
oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any   179.3779527053684
i have no motive for defending monsieur   86.12665136386565
although d artagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words   121.17415346783673
unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood   188.48664429484
but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming   106.3638190257195
laporte obeyed   8.546592258795116
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles   186.67917002238835
but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father   83.21119577337934
i left it in the pantry because i was called away   170.31249276644274
something connected with this story   138.02855556214217
you are i am edmond dantès   72.23720394412612
our safety lies in our obscurity   137.31047913112462
in a second d artagnan had made three terrible thrusts at mordaunt all of which touched but only pricked him   79.74119546799048
i believe it   64.63829509992071
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty   117.4046564887157
d artagnan alone had discovered nothing he ordinarily the most inventive of the four   8.176887495729801
the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it   172.93004481924817
asked d artagnan   17.213011444656033
his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel   207.93752574424184
why thus it is replied dantès   174.26910995810348
i loved madame bonacieux with my heart while i only love milady with my head said he   300.9648761937875
on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so secure   179.98685908971618
madame danglars   157.37383819434487
avast there all hands   170.80614846148018
eh   83.79602110525774
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth   67.30376112998388
he he is murmured grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his master s hand   81.00843180526505
no   141.23088303832657
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start   103.06513514338072
ridicule sir why you know not its power in france and yet you ought to know it   141.7925132730291
we shall pass an agreeable evening   165.2991478097775
his eminence sent me   126.49081164485169
to be decapitated   77.6839409026331
how will you have them protect you   243.32105573319296
monsieur is a gascon   51.82495416606713
wait for me here all of you   208.61165590877687
i told you of it yesterday   91.94097712588147
he asked   84.60566063680993
leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of montlhéry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name   5.453646782098716
his son madame must be since the husband of the son s mother is   127.80203937819415
i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other   58.46117964104254
queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these   168.17845598624717
you saw your wi hush   116.90236159756194
bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of st   165.43528212274248
why did you not think of me ungrateful man   159.47847496522058
he was on villefort s premises had arrived there by scaling the wall   109.41050269860916
sir my right hand correspondent is signalling   6.816120980227495
thanks monsieur   125.09022791061423
there is no harm in that   63.68782555164189
this petition to napoleon kept back by villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king s attorney   82.73599541097454
asked monte cristo   97.94470842715899
replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple   258.11950905211495
he had just completed this monologue which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue when the servant maid watching at the door suddenly cried out ah   182.45377547941575
said the young captain shaking his head   42.62342919339412
you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called me   40.08613862113759
the first who advances is a dead man   119.59754565046006
we will snatch some supper   17.863404274129593
oh i wish it you with all my heart   104.23735290110686
whatever you say my dear count   18.99790158455123
exclaimed caderousse whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny   10.01218707310531
it really must be doomed   93.72070494099853
de morcerf   26.437231671328846
bonacieux at home chapter xviii   127.92450575701537
they are going to drag her away cried d artagnan to himself springing up from the floor   39.81547640017166
and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle which was determined he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war   109.93196677778724
die   126.78306919948031
ah really this is magnificent   144.27969973612136
general oliver cromwell   163.6677659433582
well said porthos seated in the courtyard of the hotel de la chevrette to d artagnan who with a long and melancholy face had returned from the palais royal   173.06779876087813
the porter was not yet gone to bed   74.50148598629741
i have not been in bed for two nights   109.0211987628592
there you stood stammering stupefied annihilated   105.61130826333978
i your excellency   158.6269503350449
athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends poor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind   112.40820280658428
then i saw no more   174.0914557208855
at neufchâtel go to the tavern of the golden harrow give the password to the landlord and you will find as you have here a horse ready saddled   186.34693271461066
it will be useless for him to find you here   128.86281054089045
but on two conditions   99.9875244617793
and thereby you have lied twice monsieur for i saw it fall   143.7510475243024

said d artagnan   216.97977591026918
morrel advanced towards beauchamp and château renaud who seeing his intention came to meet him   205.55340703126396
these two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into pills   171.36287108118546
by the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized planchet   102.1866791581862
cried morrel   56.89386931095912
i don t say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind it s a sure way to prevent it s coming true   84.29328932100537
then said the count i refer you to your confessor   118.06794963187363
his things and his bag are with him   81.72154978645509
i take them then said the lieutenant   91.27801695195403
these notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army   72.30793862637668
oh yes yes cried the baroness   50.94658884066898
madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful   109.01623216907352
probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day   185.96634841519045
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession   127.18536732339889
he turned towards his wife   106.46454188846624
morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre stay he said m   130.98948457530247
what do you say   7.2411488957461785
but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut the obstacle compelled him to keep his place   85.51687162694463
it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution   133.256002568346
she demanded   164.48819533582125
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him   207.28848381046544
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady   112.33432184177894
aramis   215.690141695105
and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief   74.7425513930921
but woe to those who stood in my pathway   118.04933714407457
faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed   53.66482330060317
but you are not always travelling   196.12473305268054
aramis then joined athos and d artagnan who were consulting together   127.26776861444371
we have none   54.363909419546786
saved   96.12377847376243
a smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen   264.65141920948594
inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor   153.46169320293504
for from this moment you are free as the air   171.04191176921964
cried d artagnan looking at his friend with an air of doubt   190.3590913494382
well i went to a horse dealer s where i saw this magnificent horse which i have named médéah   83.88819382298912
there was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was old fashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated   71.34626455396761
cried porthos here   37.01217265377767
no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos   132.63176012626514
and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it   114.40039634652939
what is it   80.97545295102469
this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer   163.30710299641538
adieu   283.5468824140844
i know because it is my office to know everything   237.43920628465355
in the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not   112.5103610601363
i had better get on horseback and go and meet her   168.69479887965912
but how   197.34074672292007
he was a man between sixty six and sixty eight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light eyes   124.9013506320246
he then began to ascend the path   195.10966009019717
petersburg calm countries where the point of honor is better understood than among our hot headed parisians   187.83589571916934
mousqueton trembled in all his members   192.20246524817043
go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you   210.56348409710722
hum   208.76048471042208
poor woman poor woman what have they done with you   57.588630133830534

the three presents of d artagnan the elder chapter ii   142.18173187616924
cried the prisoner laughing violently and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee the king s commissioner   165.26084673502353
he went the first time to save the honor of a great queen   126.56022302136006
he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury   192.109667253856
go on monsieur bertuccio said the count   247.44999547166924
and mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular inspection   215.69764806746767
is that true and do you speak seriously   4.111498927816257
30225m monte cristo felt the arm of madame danglars stiffen while that of villefort trembled   200.60606209257787
by the orders of the deputy procureur   59.82078056065085
will you not give it sire   114.45783976566648
and think that what you are about to do is for his sake   232.26762204760155
put your names into a hat and draw lots   68.48609262224478
listen   49.18279579528452
for my part i declare d artagnan i think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom   28.364597161868772
e   118.97640828676921
yes   169.72515549243928
but where is your wicker flask monsieur mousqueton   219.60637241811622
let out your prisoner   129.16551900699613
on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb   140.20446450428062
peace be to him   137.05367982203262
the four countenances expressed four different feelings that of porthos tranquillity   171.91852840977197
i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo   66.15145810470055
or on the island of elba with its historical associations   3.1231118163810976

continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men   118.87102751064354
bah   230.09484468938092
then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry edmond dantès   160.8321189006885
an affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in paris   162.4971352172647
but i hear that he is ambitious and that s rather against him   107.51628218539503
who are you   106.87903379373918
it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing   156.50764732543448
is it possible exclaimed the count with well feigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness   111.36998539514732
said the baroness half jesting half in earnest   53.458318749836714
but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and d artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince   33.27522395768645
and knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and inactive   219.20514354530195
i pretended to pour out water from the jug but i only drank that which i had saved in my glass   36.7019470610189
on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat   135.02116133244613
replied mazarin with his italian smile   96.9087024476559
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone   220.12630076651521

de boville and on the 30th the 32 500 francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man   109.92944102799821
but he soon sighed for he passed before la réserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball   163.70115318779338
the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing for a ship s lantern was hung up at the mast head instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore   166.5582852891714
valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate   199.45970007387783
listen captain baldi   195.9940341488265
may i ask what you were doing there   11.301417734586039

i was sure of it the cursed letter   68.79522709769435
mademoiselle paulet had already gone   109.01083887049303
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket   129.87263195685514
we have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame   129.51077553943745
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation   158.2903990537599
good   45.3995489860653
20083m and do you propose to make this journey very shortly   107.96266010773594
they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious   142.59711976457731
said danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love   22.9846947467679
at four o clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables   146.96308225394304
what are you doing   74.85228285913453
i can do it said porthos   255.6581261888374
now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties   172.72511640777634
the rooms are all carpeted   110.71506093486785
leave that to me i have my plan   35.7332147077729
a moment after caderousse s face appeared at the grating in the door   81.00027061657107
was it with that intention you followed me   53.917160310139444
then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in vain   148.8574477335275
and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances   92.72675778901585
the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared   105.82549236610316
i shall return to the catalans   108.79749209407345
he must be about twenty three years of age said athos in a low tone   181.87961161989995
cried morrel   105.81546838721223
he then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the left   100.9210428384531
the governor can be present   180.41825818200164
and then must not all be over   79.1311007748194
it was the letter of aramis monsieur d artagnan you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale   127.54098135955084
you know that she is and i demand her liberty of you   4.268894405082122
the king s authority will put all this to rights   188.2729904327345
i wait till i am confided in and apart from that which lord de winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to me   230.25544522456556
asked the count   13.849634265633924
de villefort who was busy taking down some notes raised his head at the mention of this date   130.12403190453782
but in my opinion and i have a right to dictate the preliminaries as it is i who have received the provocation in my opinion the time ought not to be yet   104.20372293968727
but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy   215.7413859681098
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god   26.788969636864536

they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed   108.66917586516334
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity   127.83954901221682
scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye   73.52906350906301
why when i found myself utterly destitute i thought my old friends would perhaps assist me   13.651729605546564
and that is exactly the snare the king s enemies are preparing for the poor child   94.76343417447934
as for the two others i had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that i have forgotten their real ones   145.57424042613445
one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count   40.45920445168386

ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then good bye to the pharaon   98.99609418197612
yes and no   130.2728628701037
do you recognize me   133.9803557245793
the delinquent had escaped to the rue des lombards and rushed into a house   220.85927429916933
the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of père lachaise where m   107.45512867985363

cried olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is drifting   143.01949904823354
the latter smiled   104.70909483156689
cried monte cristo   15.534894217045661
27 do not let us jest gravely replied bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it   77.09294965580114

two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would   113.81964018985254
chance caused that man to be myself   80.88706817295349
bertuccio lay covers for three   95.56437700898829

he will arrange everything for me   137.71598325763662
no   87.02714322314132
and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know   142.80390855702385
then give me water cried danglars endeavoring to parry the blow   79.91374757044063
the little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet high   118.82540345828782
but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband   147.4083091474194
it is well sir replied villefort from below it is well   133.36238226388002
sulpice   86.83791971860077

the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied you are a native of marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going   88.63198418441307

the scotchman   48.62219481239522
ah how good you are to say so valentine   88.76646850812841
and the man   162.45130927611692
a very simple one said valentine   176.91886861688835
i am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the duke of buckingham to him whom you allowed to be assassinated to the duchess de chevreuse whom you suffered to be exiled to the duc de beaufort whom you imprisoned   149.8935645413029
why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a table covered with flowers and gently glided into death amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses   158.72213322139987
the tumult now began to increase   34.210276422268265
at herlier planchet who led the column turned to the left   65.79610665310318
30029m above us all sir was monte cristo s response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered   179.56456726427513
his name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the palais royal   157.3666308656767
i could never agree to it   162.16310847634261

soon as kitty left him d artagnan directed his steps toward the rue férou   38.20593757055272
take courage sir   175.12727623254875
the youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the duchess de chevreuse   15.06364070017463
that s too many gentlemen too many   3.426940437533233
villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three ill looking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frock coat and hat with broad brim   142.52995172259992
her hand   62.07026566106512
there isn t a morsel of bread in the house   125.242483690914
i have plenty of time and it will be more correct   157.69273474592848
is it the custom in marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their anterooms   99.33824596140944
and being a musketeer but for a time i only fight when i am forced to do so and always with great repugnance   79.89696798839185
let us proceed   198.9466705021579
edmond turned away his head with a sigh   243.24391766639638
but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation   80.34009185782664
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired   120.2745686042938
danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide   122.01865269263035
but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed   114.42384381623845
there are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured morrel cocles and julie   223.924417962187
and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month   184.68893299995307
after dinner the play   111.35125731459044
i have promised no more than i have given you teresa said luigi proudly   174.09137863891394
yes caderousse you have seen me   132.0781688805983
an old gentleman continued the concierge a staunch follower of the bourbons   130.43811988550303
he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets   105.89785509703906
and he withdrew sighing   57.93038356852725
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament   14.149075111989859
there was a moment of complete silence during which dantès still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time   53.390712640030145
felton my lad did you not perceive that you were taken for a novice and that the first act was being performed of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments   167.61930490166708
yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation   241.58657307820687
well now what are your conditions if i employ you   93.75777458640812
it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by observation   98.42048080174199
yet he did not return home   63.327198442348276
did you ever see her furious   114.77983906023603
de villefort   216.40669401463273
the major looked anxiously around him   40.82136824805906
ah   156.092237618945
is she french   35.42261460742249
everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey   105.65943234009048
your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome   104.32333659953974
he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps   79.53182209807628
entirely so my dear d artagnan   151.26417859850955
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation   231.20527173045807
unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber   182.3633500797103
and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom   202.1605006547392
one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is a knight of malta as timid as a young girl   93.12065598812333
be good enough to open to me for i wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet him   22.18626071451571
madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase   127.05583756921013
it is my soul that must be saved   199.4670794948301
but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment   75.52925186147164
caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan   200.47530188364502
how   160.41185493936405
besides you sent me word that you would come to me and i have held myself at your disposal   81.30099387463346
i wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody   149.7537836431182
hold your tongue hypocrite said andrea   133.69873443734218
athos smiled   130.21039653608167
she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror   75.1952658755759
halloo   118.58935152090368
perhaps so   57.767391542317014
all was vain   38.52415863826003
as long as it was dark they remained silent   175.8093550598405
said villefort   33.06789161214819
athos talked of the discretion of grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth   83.62451592644315
in that case go and get ready   128.6672544304071
cried he raising his head with quick anxiety   145.90908045580653
but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it   115.82659151427633
just the very way not to know   64.79261905602313
their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence   101.53551208332455
asked franz of the count   33.604387975235056
but where are you really going   77.33172518446779
she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color   144.86978000183993
ah   63.323769014437495
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs   170.790138033726
is that your name monsieur   7.418469012166383
i answer for all that the prince said   166.92823284464836
i do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost   110.29678346571757
outside this door a spade was placed against the wall   167.25519012643127
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that d artagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queen s letter and for which he had repaid m   19.21405828019013
from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he wanted   116.05521561481095
the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again   36.80701008207099
yes   81.03493519738802
you will do for me what you have done for the queen   140.73824872982783
you are a worthy daughter of epirus haydée and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace   97.82514932906366
and they may have the fact attested whenever they please   96.17314073018247
those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers   193.97000751194327
as for m   105.14367992280651
yes   132.7046457483084
ah   114.01771438766093
his deep set eyes were hollow and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face   108.98841288039122
said porthos   158.87960737735588
the duke more and more bewildered let grimaud loose and took the note   157.23782123683722
and that particularly at this period the compatriots of d artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated   163.74307862284726
but cried felton that is a fleur de lis which i see there   188.07172159451537
every niche in the wall held its living statue   98.53174879838097
the cardinal s replied mme   153.41209313255652
de bracieux de pierrefonds added porthos   134.25515969285735
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night   64.72853983026164
anne of austria took one step backward became so pale that it might be said she was dying and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind her to keep herself from falling she with her right hand drew the paper from her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals   53.03719059760141
cried the pretended monk pardon you   143.52434285820902
but my lord if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall i reply   124.63586309106105
they have some capital wine here please to observe that in passing   173.69746553098884
if i am not saved i shall be avenged   99.145799530356
and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution   179.4247630810358
shall i write your deposition   75.16338115863385
then you abandon me doctor   226.159730503817
yes i understand now to find one woman you court another   52.58346893292217
and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness   116.32978033839792
emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make julie decide immediately made him reply   181.95307026965673
listen said gaetano lowering his voice i do not know if what they say is true he stopped to see if anyone was near   32.57005267805687
and afterwards the road to châtillon   150.15198817173447
i know not if he heard these words   145.08171448508546
occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary   9.857157614306601
i have said monsieur and i repeat that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket   150.3639936880135
dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what i sabring right and left among the bedouins can have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels   155.8782713316195
but what then   174.02094685944724
tis off one of my sheep   155.43681509208193
still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness   85.94450002658266
and mme   115.91924046761399
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them   209.3975770248952
and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others   203.75124096865034
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned   203.2567972435361
chapter xxvii   51.107436948907264
oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after i have had the happiness to possess you only a single time   134.19279282980077
two or three times even to the great astonishment of his friends he had when aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him replaced a verb in its right tense and a noun in its case   189.72629664217183
i make no requests or commands   131.27940262153965
milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and more   92.67812435359964
your blessing your holiness before you go i beseech you   139.38855539377263
madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv   145.30701621598186
morrel yes   83.94664268292905
said villefort turning pale   201.74004130465164
exclaimed the queen   75.04812778497657
monsieur porthos what do you say to that   192.47402377770442
to paris first   154.2170739119501
cried morrel when i left her dying   66.28871372811271
indeed   9.155111108159474
i have   137.62976726032807
i had the king and monsieur the whole of one day in my care   108.03508843172567
a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and monte cristo appeared   117.00992798126103
dividing the proceeds the apartment on the first floor of the house in the rue saint germain des prés where albert de morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious person   96.22699374767357
dear d artagnan   191.7798948106677
haven t you then a fourth companion   219.87305158745176
well that s something for i have not the shadow of one said athos coolly   147.06414804004328
an hour before daybreak cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to march   93.23059521962455
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step   76.51480868808686
which road   27.430902186627563
they search her   55.71352038818763
but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure   27.385723801053615
said porthos   178.4336655316505
posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by reason   167.09000634462774
what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say   100.64854239325106
brunhilda and fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its infancy when man was learning to control mind were it even by an emissary from the realms of darkness   108.18271112087625
then that it might not be known i had done so i filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which i double locked carrying off the key   119.06654925250291
caderousse approached him just as danglars whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room   22.411263216351273
the agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of groslow who at the hour fixed by mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors   181.5169890289088
my name is lady clarik and this measure this measure is general madame   79.99254724335029
we arrived four or five days ago from the vendomois as you know and we are going to give mazarin something to do   115.77320503099098
i am for no one   188.60202346089935
that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either   145.39444318364755
this indeed is praiseworthy nay more it is sublime   89.50566990981915
sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible   33.728029798962964
cried mousqueton   30.233249882161076
inquired danglars turning pale   15.935748533579215
under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend   78.22263390355435
why   84.43228803226962
the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris   173.2689939526826
the brigadier advanced to him sword in hand   56.59113027089008
anne of austria s eyes shot glances of fire   127.6507286198235
yes   170.57912154635852
besides it was necessary he should stay at chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess   64.38296771159935
i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so   129.30495541012755
the face of the shortest of those three gentlemen   115.00511330657591
but there was none   112.71839968170893
de villefort   40.96203924180121
get them at borel s and be sure you say they are for me   101.73981601863801
the blood mounted to the temples of debray who held a million in his pocket book and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women one of whom justly dishonored had left it poor with 1 500 000 francs under her cloak while the other unjustly stricken but sublime in her misfortune was yet rich with a few deniers   55.96428324121935
mazarin sprang forward   136.69899711642856
in this garden mercédès had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty four years previously   152.3201368297248
i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercédès   138.40662406009523
i believe not   50.5911736403164
these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray   250.59966423406345
the cardinal repressed a smile   118.77236061789668
asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder   68.79886109764622
she having been sold to me seven years previously with her mother who had died on arriving at constantinople by a french colonel in the service of the vizier ali tepelini named fernand mondego   84.40040369746308
what was there in it   174.68588491544463
no no   68.13080376482881
de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you   188.7393389217142
what can we do   165.24643650965425
there was no further question therefore about marie michon among the four musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw mme   83.29864194532516
the rumor of edmond s arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city   150.13635399685506
he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower stands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle piece the countess s smelling bottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered my dear mother have you been ill during my absence   134.88429801814584
the king threw himself into an arm chair   122.62295186958389
then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us   309.03482858457926
but i don t want your arm at all   144.52365382743608
cried one of the guards will you persist in saying most discreet aramis that you are not on good terms with madame de bois tracy when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs   204.02445151037347
duke you already know that it is not i who caused you to be written to   88.67169520147675
madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously   115.84887520549327
and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished   116.41484273852292
i owe you the proofs and explanations of what i have said   120.700520570011
most undoubtedly said planchet   95.82651001439706
yes monsieur said mousqueton but in a very ill humor   68.39732157219466
if you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it   112.4026822265656
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted   56.09727062054966
stammered madame de villefort   151.69202266483614
still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres   180.96154269992059
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter   31.330650540442306
bring them here   137.50933615691866
ah my dear sir you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person   47.67135511792597
if mousqueton were with us observed athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this   135.17256595624602
the poor duke swore fell into a rage yelled and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the marechal ornano and the grand prior of vendome   91.79914860703863
really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse   164.13602208935015
you know this chief then   2.867858030468767
why then not let me out by the door   124.35006744381803
and it is you you whom i make responsible before god and before men for my shame and my infamy   92.42025870191077
and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination   209.91582723656998
he then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols   201.90244218082665
where are you going   200.8304913715196
when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood   171.04764673200935
what   109.34234345906752
well perhaps you are right said athos   130.2798611373105
noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort   51.671065411366456
his eminence was uneasy and sent me to find you   103.29165988974754
the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris   139.47455660290504
then the count added aloud was his name ever known   6.395576976468121
for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed   101.50924598238157
i must conscientiously perform my duty   151.17888983535084
i had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing   128.88231945083686
but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady   189.68874102517006
and he went out   96.63061180524643
do you grasp that   165.07783791449464
if you cross a bridge feel every plank of it with your foot lest one should give way beneath you   197.34234054256362
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos   30.785180226794566
no no my boy   145.48194412406312
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room and went to open the door himself   137.44038917609504
in that box   144.30222020536237
where   22.777932577122684
the two friends went near him   103.34641330346682
and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me   151.42892324856894
two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done   138.44900528220455
milady replied to this question by another question   167.2335297816296
chapter lxiii   75.68586541218147
he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything   132.69637567090476
a letter addressed to monsieur de tréville captain of the musketeers   127.29569888606252
no politics caderousse   30.068476190262132
assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your master s blood   63.83435372076154
and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m   234.7140562963213
but to her great surprise d artagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds   110.52220007648552
yours wholly and most affectionately marie de montbazon   84.03101847427014
the abbé smiled   78.70967724272684
oh you love her still said kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young man s countenance for an instant   37.447738983466735
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on   173.5392469791739
most willingly duke   33.198680678782225
will m   195.7593021258828
oh as to that monseigneur it is true said athos   115.5942580035636
it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours   127.57511745000954
which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists   114.39795916559046
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person   127.1641540886519
monsieur de chavigny where was he   100.87944196141129
what might be the consequences   114.5777008180238
you are certainly an extraordinary man said danglars   70.248804950919
so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m   84.79887740363569
cried he seizing my arm and wresting from me the weapon that had so badly served me you want to take my life do you my pretty puritan   96.8486164592756
and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths   79.73578246888442
i know not   7.99943094677198
proceed sir said the count   102.42195745953458
good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you   107.74125273297258
the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask   98.11086935550662
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him   23.875969047469283
that is well said mme   37.0411149904848
when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching   103.35277535533893
madame de villefort started   68.98047244823434
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier   160.53944384362123
he was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first   79.177655434983
do stay added la carconte in a tremulous voice   52.18668403905082
monsieur cardinal has enlightened me on that head   161.95146904355641
come said the king will you swear by my father that athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it   168.3000480844252
four   95.30052134607077
bring the prisoner in again said the cardinal   50.90357360072572
the young girl s lover was in cucumetto s troop   22.12742213192584
but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water   174.94746199420274
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money   68.63528512201943
well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together   74.17019081621223
most decidedly said he men are not equal and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers   144.28806780375547
family   72.69586349403284
go on   124.18276785885635
but that is not all   150.72182306237468
raoul turned toward athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go   112.05599076483482
oh father do not look in that way at me   65.86779819682756
you are at your journey s end   231.14289795169518
he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40 000 francs payable at sight on you signed by busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsement of course i immediately counted him over the forty bank notes   186.09788578509946
de chevreuse who told it to two or three of her intimates that yielding to his vocation he had retired into a convent only into which nobody knew   31.32068340457195
i don t think he put the faucet in again   137.50312885345986
there are no italian banditti said debray   135.41515469101532
when they spoke although teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier as luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good looking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination   146.28510233946565
but as soon as i let go he will howl again   65.88414855748806
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself   219.8577371224294
you are ill perhaps   42.98872317765995
the voice became more and more indistinct   64.32413344043351
everywhere   164.08283048590266
do you know what he has done this child   155.9440228465574
that is understood said d artagnan   83.3559155441592
that his style of writing is very good   63.312599309476404
i am going that i may not bring fresh trouble into your family and to set an example which every honest and devoted man situated as i am may follow   25.249525996272
thus tis quite decided said d artagnan that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you   186.4278308693656
god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets   144.25845126517402
d artagnan then only half lied which is lying but little when he said that by going in search of milady he at the same time went in search of constance   107.68910549309115
pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion   42.051860571692956
that is agreed upon   176.04255041639175
nevertheless he did return   216.36859060536074
yes we are young   54.26491495938285
both   115.58862611241418
tréville was one of these latter   299.51963292389644
are you hurt sir   108.95534186214354
who sent you   10.349144150889629
and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de breuil   256.5340862800522
monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him   76.14615053559851
he will   197.4652031353503
and he arose   94.37624663110378
very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil   176.86030502810647
yonder is the house porthos said the gascon   145.85766006233848
i have not and i can not make three copies of that letter because it is sealed   9.90404853922108
he is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours   154.1599190862962
cried one of the ladies   83.2585006513331
these were all who were left of the little troop   100.5626267326539
proud toward an old friend   99.85961640035478
i beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier   224.9159663613812
they are not all traitors   111.29676951261669
and now here are 32 500 francs payable shortly   144.4821043820379
still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot   95.4486127466591
replied the steward   128.75407011427416
if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison   73.91352556957108
i am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that i wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory   152.0825497103392
first a thrust with the coadjutor whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet s and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me   84.53551814513379
d artagnan hits on a plan   203.1920837760888
hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face   35.62011606319159
how is there still time   24.46318654918997
and m   252.0586949959496
and you have lost it   61.885329331851594
what he   101.14796273592837
never mind sir we will not forget you   207.6902631969399
anne of austria was then twenty six or twenty seven years of age   52.53892525138154
murmured the young man too late   106.46404330857935
yes   54.83973952268464
madame de bois tracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces i believe for a trustworthy maid   101.35115474676302
the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them   85.79776315563477
the more reason you should fire the first   12.381683606728046
the two friends having agreed to leave blaisois and grimaud at compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses   35.470988250430906
50203m before you quit us count said julie will you permit us to express to you all that the other day madame interrupted the count taking her two hands in his all that you could say in words would never express what i read in your eyes   157.3196097110105
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinal s arm   202.7844173189383
cried albert   182.33132576277464
he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now   110.53431497260313
yes my lord   125.8679587016293
said morcerf more and more astonished   123.11750303383116
danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage   148.78219700397247
the two men in black who guessed d artagnan s meaning darted at him a glance which might have been thought threatening   241.26543552698513
albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling   113.61089516542395
then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly   129.32431887300996
i ll try said the duke   151.735549456504
well we must put up with that said the countess who was herself from one of the oldest venetian families   91.36136114246563
that was five years ago   90.16671919293097
said beauchamp   134.77226626911173
the proverb was but too correct as regarded benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition   125.59695509238311
he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come   150.65564432291882
the matter enters completely into the duties of the post   147.0853563867581
there on turning round d artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared   92.77922702893605
yes   167.62765329091383
what do you wish sir   184.5750765148411
do you know the house of thomson french   175.0535475656369
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom   43.873529100409456
d artagnan felt the truth of this reproach   158.42670766629894
run and seek athos porthos and aramis   162.1241539436177
he was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his hand   9.410294953918992
to congratulate me what for   38.53298070333835
judge for yourself replied he   46.91474945233472
thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with ice   81.05649103920996
grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man   17.555131464456025
it cried   145.74589023763977
during this time dantès at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests   56.25450503448454
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth   81.61413098170175
one evening i was in a garden   18.791718042130185
they continued to admire it but said no more about it   205.45535572474625
monte cristo turned around   161.85820465864154
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle   45.20453326526203
said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture   176.27871783654638
anne questioned d artagnan by a look   64.89672990667057
30203m how do you know   78.6885752571449
porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion   112.51024794275011
the fact is count answered the mother agreeably flattered he has great aptitude and learns all that is set before him   302.0074179844146
and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess   41.41333577504628
in particular there is one yonder of a gascon look   53.21913888921965
i also have had dreams   30.964929446934732
see i have sold my watch for 100 francs and the guard and seals for 300   31.919631659666848
and he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after madame danglars departure before he left the house   15.084802316107002
de tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning   127.67608326878947
my dear fellow replied albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleon s maxim never awaken me but for bad news   42.9765589510766
what convent   70.68986047754962
you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars   19.2724943113826
you ought to be brave for two reasons the first is that you are a gascon and the second is that you are my son   100.34611628487158
ah said albert it was she   127.48622517899518
said porthos   163.96659828384446
still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age   20.12771844605433
now madame here are 800 notes of 1 000 francs each resembling as you see a large book bound in iron   120.35680588071855
replied the swiss   92.1806391187337
chapter lxxv   119.39225682359226
sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south   104.60133344631055
tis true   192.88965003819555
20093m but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said franz   15.03220347222593
in addition to the levees of the king and the cardinal there might be reckoned in paris at that time more than two hundred smaller but still noteworthy levees   57.607991224051474
but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have the good fortune to be beloved by you   146.42010177917786
tis well   82.84236228708122
yes   134.52677175069766
they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose   86.76710724652551
a smile lit up the old man s face a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face   177.63448852921394
each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added albert with a laugh   112.87326680382097
my god i am dying   111.97185717958963
he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner   202.68227312055336
had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said monte cristo i must believe on seeing you   3.975407871493843
he is a great commander bragelonne   185.23815045598909
fernand whom you see here is a good and brave catalan one of the best fishermen in marseilles and he is in love with a very fine girl named mercédès   84.01743498854944
so that porthos will be a baron   118.83196919118896
danglars left   79.7915894830289
then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize   157.8510644112094
to me to you to us   5.90343806720432
i can not make you share the fate i have planned for myself   73.68113629799346
good lord   88.6912042398909
which of the two denounced him   54.21222854562594
did i ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to marie de medici   124.38189455693933
monsieur monsieur   99.35424498317204
de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me a favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness   87.03727084199139
he pushed back his bed and waited for day   33.88175897199875
let us join with that side to which the wind will carry it and resume our adventurous life   181.39251353395545
no   172.4152499074029
you live on your estate happy in golden mediocrity   106.20954330019173
i perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he muttered   188.8995891468077
i should lose myself in the cardinal s opinion   45.234244086671765
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out   142.3781944121888
wait a minute then said aramis   209.68381088999007
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future   136.33525325680455
in my trunks   145.59286943273077
are we not pretty good christians   220.8314201601433
cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity   36.08661999027288
no i want to live   119.83197008969884
money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require   70.6225608427495
really   195.90991241641103
if i knew that he did i should know all   197.14358530973675
what is the matter if you please   202.60951350857312
it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration   181.07985688930245
yes a fowl   178.52154548692482
the count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her shoulder   139.3021087865605
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners   101.22826682977302
and the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed   277.973581686463
you have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between us   94.98262059713898
you think of everything   184.68621028106134
said caderousse who drank as he spoke and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect under any circumstances fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of dantès   90.8411290933436
the register of my child s birth   80.9047406477365
we were but the instruments that is all   143.26116596310166
never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably here   19.425683732148443
he found buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own hand   168.35448290555462
returned penelon   155.69680545196184
are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis   170.7862695356512
at half past seven the retreat was sounded   28.67088189885291
thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history   74.23189751926643
she joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a word   88.32682479496188
you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows   105.94351930363541
tis well   103.07647714765973
de liancourt by m   74.2496035342269
at these words the murmur without became an explosion   93.60105481120847
justify yourself if you can   152.64238099772123
and you know added d artagnan that whenever i catch him i will kill him this mordaunt   78.7517485240483
you would be revenged on him because i do not love you   102.95641132356751
mazarin smiled but became very pale   278.67340021842034
one of them was called the chevalier d artagnan   253.31598960681777
porthos was in bed and was playing a game at lansquenet with mousqueton to keep his hand in   175.31773637635132
the house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea   188.54744008923169
let us go   130.75100740882422
mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in paris replied caderousse   183.29927539285774
what will our two friends say   102.28182510426348
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away   95.55275769177403
at the manner in which felton laid the book upon the little table near which milady was sitting at the tone in which he pronounced the two words your mass at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them milady raised her head and looked more attentively at the officer   36.000109779387856
impossible   231.39357523495602
answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness   200.24207048152834
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus   167.66578438211346
the family name was fully given   173.98319018237564
the officer of the guard then with his chessboard   153.48714746378272
nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her   0.0939930673692686
yes my wife pointed him out to me one day   159.7508220792822
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work   160.80963667016556
the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically   3.5994132526277554
it is they who on the contrary overcome fate   126.47874513964453
and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter said debray   86.43105384861833
all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed   134.5524889016203
she is very amiable then is she not   168.30503498670163
milady recognized his step   56.82241959128344
and d artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently   73.92293433848614
in my opinion the people are right   213.0715627508792
his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel   50.3958082603299
and let us speak it to the praise of m   131.30101592384491
when villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said d épinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club that i may at least know who killed my father   76.52751847812127
and whatever might be considering the violent character of milady the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her   150.8248023009629
how do i know it   44.83076562436969
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength   157.88580901284718
i will go i will go   185.91895986906871
monte cristo gave him a glass of water   159.88405280337275
i entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if i may venture to tell you so i also feel anxious   161.31903198029295
within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly   90.12668962436774
it was all up with him continued aramis   76.0853226375138
but she would not spare him a single pang   118.71746956746927
i am not like you viscount   156.3047802392756
de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise   99.67342435511729
undoubtedly   13.998553183869646
asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture   136.35823757885854
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey   104.37708474603572
when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winter to quit paradise for earth heaven for hell   10.62754898337397
why   182.2259873633016
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except monte cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence   59.498851859545326
so much the better   189.6216026794445
ah you fear your prisoner should escape   151.18924122314664
and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done   100.87057128618017
yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone another upon the highway or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest aves cœli comederunt illam   121.80222171863393
one hundred thousand francs repeated peppino   95.72996309167962
i warn you however his services will cost you something   38.90492912100078
and at half past two o clock the mayor of marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall   95.06297781659778
yet thither it was that dantès guided his vessel and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day   75.10866449329423
as to love the only woman he could have loved was mme   60.00622442166314
bravo   96.45433766751378
look at this lady raoul she is an historic personage   100.01813426479444
they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination   207.70249886407078
they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the holders   101.07513085747915
but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long   180.2907564200648
your pardon sir replied villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men   94.03098209671023
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides comminges s troop ten good soldiers to confront   145.23376607623902
i traveled in england when i was young i speak english like an englishman and aramis too knows something of the language   133.63922690198294
but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir   97.45402504195623
at these words he threw me a crown which i picked up and he took the ladder   112.05592398417292
i do   234.3024418265254
we ll gag him and tie him no matter where somewhere   85.9746947480138
certainly   19.54557981262785
but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin   67.73024061103297
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count   185.01004652916225
we shall know sir replied the president   156.30933575777243
fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to pathaud s account   118.00378016965163
i am betrayed on all sides   70.49707428628986
ah   71.79960211325536
have you informed him of it   160.12748844134865
well i will give it up then said the young woman sighing   31.31465243000386
he took the glass and raised it to his lips   157.29274420303278
she had to deal with a gascon who played close   134.56262259171072
as certainly maximilian as i now press your hand i shall kill him before ten o clock tomorrow morning   138.35818515472323
he had good cause to do so   201.2699688520687
what does you mean by boor michon   145.8275298595953
yet jacopo reached him first   161.26464868860012
d artagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out   189.86651142788406
the article relative to morcerf   147.1149989053492
they merit richly that piece of attention on your part   125.94460259445025
i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession   47.22390332393624
how my fault   116.42378369154854
that did more honor to your heart than to your experience m   110.53842992573783
let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures   72.7827098526935
do you know what torture is   108.8145890055441
do you think so   119.26486513179637
carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions   193.2478134771211
you pique my curiosity dear rochefort   188.89250858868675
where do you wish to be taken   60.532858556275215
i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay   127.81324816854894
franz essayed to smile   216.1410929691737
chapter 52   207.01037206161004
we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion   76.32440030080164
that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought   120.55279362130537
don t think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he   215.69442686631282
what a question   12.44034118988219
where is this dear aramis   146.1243794789855
his face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement   123.21256684395843
you have not guessed rightly   111.83454595315801
pronounce one single word muttered d artagnan and you are a dead man   129.31580852102542
cried morcerf   177.057601044656
why should they   102.50556158328098
albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting   139.5107155176326
what had become of him he cared not to inquire   120.27956483950155
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model   145.96941531165027
perhaps returned the count smiling   149.59802013891252
you are very kind but i may be prevented   100.07933499293148
have you anything to ask of me   160.37828002017812
and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could see   19.6856527305479
haydée is almost as civilized as a parisian   81.83730853184653
a charming woman was that marie michon resumed athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas   164.64258059980915
no your excellency returned bertuccio   61.74806831305932
said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good   52.587741771919326
question him then   149.76531213921018
of what nature   101.05705500806454
mademoiselle said franz turning towards valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age   12.414142323912898
what is going on   5.2645143512131085
said albert do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of rome like lawyers clerks   66.76178030455151
if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his head if anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three days if anyone had said to either of us then live the day will come when you will be happy and will bless life   138.86210037299014
you accept however   130.19871392073
the house at auteuil chapter 44   143.28706365482506
and what sort of revenge would you take   84.6677808802572
cried d artagnan athos what has become of athos   70.06342510575323
d artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off   100.68892972408872
with the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of france   143.2301326461192
do you possess 400 000 francs   103.87438162275656
athos and aramis followed him   154.53222881647196
for instance you shall see   170.29929074958392
d artagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more self control had banished from his own   151.305223722165
as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete   94.29909625961344
do so   151.43487792403198
i do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me   116.23464061467772
i wish to receive her majesty s commands from her own lips   58.96364117061667
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation   124.94061751026122
finally milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her lips   48.86163071568396
and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st   72.37347658277179
she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the order signed by the duke of buckingham   140.6757985371846
no madame something easier to grant   121.37832107707928
we shall return to them unless mazarin razes them to the ground   115.95336265490286
yes   59.956526126631616
i command here   64.3943022383006
it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry   123.7391185975655
and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion   98.510326593414
at the moment he passed through the gateway into the street the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped although it was in the month of august and lifted his hat which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head pulling it eagerly over his eyes   122.58523035099206
that s right   206.76617191098484
you can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than speak   107.39049197761696
i shall go and shoot on his estate   225.6217697846583
it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous   75.0408384682815
i waited for him until this hour replied franz   131.3898670086045
two hours passed away   158.71404517464163
for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for peppino called rocca priori   37.255558707058654
is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it   13.19292538746322
yes   57.13685893316433
she will soon be softened   165.92133611878992
what are yanina and its vizier to you edmond   67.73326637829743
stop said he i have an idea   80.79684909423403
but i soon found out that he was betraying me   48.072295778222184
and he is a count   69.33608375026117
jacques de la boucherie   49.25066138465401
i have had some   101.02902556666176
ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation   88.17626618536381
what more could the most devoted lover desire   94.88039287034564
oh i am already grandly recompensed   105.54062048299846
hear me athos said d artagnan   68.58802591177623
there were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls valenciennes lace english veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called the corbeille   122.1830950494428
exclaimed de winter   106.07141906098204
albert placed it in his button hole and the carriage went triumphantly on   38.20072001318633
you will know presently pass it   61.065872672602346
but putting his head out of the carriage eh   178.03507866178055
but what if i were mistaken   99.53089282386351
then why did he purchase it   216.2555807599802
a mischance   182.12730629639503
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied d artagnan   105.82036891577658
porthos linked his arm in that of his friend   59.09616362360809
well monsieur de montbazon is the husband of madame de montbazon and and madame de montbazon is the mistress of the duc de beaufort   90.12450975274614
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand   195.76308667186368
the man in the mask   178.72157922286488
she would have taken d artagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache   177.8534902918979
justice is done said porthos wiping his forehead   115.52726978543095
are you a priest   235.86767394051586
but i thought this mark of consideration due to you   144.17249435065042
are you very anxious to know countess   131.31404133814362
luigi vampa   118.41460007663227
de bassompierre who was embroiled with the duc d angoulême   39.46444583864195
said d artagnan with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it   63.80312173932303
oh beautiful life   97.87312559611914
alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father s love   171.4074443495299
the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour   45.40508804455513
thought d artagnan   90.11344285494027
it is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m   37.90414136424934
but you do not know how long that arrest lasted   77.45878985986704

and according to his custom d artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him   165.4902515192248
the woman s hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his face   113.35128523581564

in the name of the king i arrest you   134.25628157053345
i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it   115.01960834196565
i sought for a reply but could find none i was silent   165.04284651772224
danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dantès   81.21811210528605
oh no   127.05622594129741
on   154.76029377282484
what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you   17.55243665866601
now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation with captain leclere   9.694466802575093
ah   87.06927903431642
replied d artagnan   90.54385281400563
and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you   63.822958170817145
if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed a being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain   43.9565618591095
la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus   73.12014293617997
nevertheless one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away   144.9597432125578
this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of m   50.88863990984969
why so   19.338760439799955
said kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you   107.63229590004858
hurry up there you rascal   97.02349027667807
all that would be folly   85.5197173006895
let me see what time it is   29.263161034124337
said blaisois   138.0382908466481
he cursed the instant when m   154.44617601705835
the eyes repeated several times no no no   36.307499929437256
poor fellow   164.33734884440008
there came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him   135.7627907186001
it is monsieur d artagnan   164.63002371378434
you will not pardon me   152.37629361668928
on the contrary the meaning of m   92.691093551782
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject   159.95731526186051
hush   37.84557623881828
it is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation   97.3865969067873
yes   124.52950275268988
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing   40.42611656922452
the contract chapter 97   107.9680649235199
you admit that you would fight then   122.43683687678947
seven or eight hundred thousand francs   140.06436002022156
i have to pay a visit this evening replied he   84.45276426803113
20291m and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman   158.560921622557
i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy   0.5918040817213921
asked he   62.35406044665707
and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them   96.60691354216756
for i am sure the count is his father   186.04520740004955
in the morning when they entered milady s chamber they had brought her breakfast   28.435106423830973
athos however perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen   134.055481230509
ten men for monsieur de comminges   74.71458403018454
scarcely ever   154.39023634144803
empty your pockets said he   35.51183945309438
then he bowed   101.034499657977
the hands were white but without delicacy   74.75055211371505
it frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners   8.731834856332654
d artagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a diamond   129.32150575066765
athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear   62.11018898219996
will it be the same this evening   51.849963848299936
25th april 149 well   53.92617925508939
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive   164.85740380391547
well then let me have a bottle of the least expensive   163.3982529364957
yes said d artagnan   217.23257256860427
i am enormously anxious to finish my night at the duke of bracciano s   39.4305879189087
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la fere i can see nothing remarkable about it   81.41554834704226
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat   118.21086825497785
speak i beg of you   199.18899187518338
pooh   56.4160511028711
at length athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased   75.34254277222769
do you think so sir   185.149855540075
a horse   170.37209389013043
athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired   29.070432000874888
what dreadful sufferings   114.40632077704848
charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip   58.96051318290094
my lord to a well bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track   196.7046166092312
come on come on   119.70201870114326
while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke all things which appeared to d artagnan monstrous impossibilities   141.31687900384617
pay me differently   89.63511283438334
but meanwhile continued m   118.39750751590314
faith   192.19643723411298
those two men were the count de rochefort and the mendicant of saint eustache   88.67750417865352
you don t know where aramis is   94.60758190085873
in addition to this after a half hour s conversation d artagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot   47.21499331491516
by his manner sir and his age   49.919449016235546
and without listening to villefort he arose and followed valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to   67.09694029031218
i will give them to you   68.78527309939128
he said it only depended on myself to have it and i had only one word to say   163.17241872037988
and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated   231.6795893838589
from the count said bertuccio   142.16044102914978
for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to mazarin as every gentleman ought to be   89.196230907861
you have said my lord   157.7081196740623
a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deep seated hatred of ideality these were the elements of private and public life displayed by m   94.0844238632545
said i are you pleased   164.14831579829075
are you no longer my master or have i ceased to be your slave   88.4775435500798
i will have those letters   103.41281995062221
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his watch   110.12934666132759
have you that means   72.35383611506622
go leave me   52.00537681715538
exclaimed the king s attorney   63.96022084670082
cried she hastening away with the young man   85.30860632970027
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan   152.07066700205226
then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the door   210.21403428477757
of course i have   175.91999167911234
you know the proverb unlucky at play lucky in love   91.37069990241
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he   151.94286327462348
truly murmured valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not   112.49194078373596
you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no ill will to signor luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman   91.99662491664937
oh yes said kitty clapping her hands very willing   201.42234599969345
thus louis xiii   202.2906279205788
yes   135.7622322656805
in the position of porthos d artagnan would have been perfectly happy   181.51240237183308
advise me what i had better do   167.24859575525457
no   198.3130631039337
his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert s grief stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men   131.64472305991757
and i will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the persons   108.60460660478122
the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired   22.29976501947212
murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired   195.22384984651933
i have been wrong   7.972306004547576
the count was silent but continued to gaze around him   132.47696553314626
i think i can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome saddle   155.58248195540688
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness   70.83269479924866
as you say mazarin is a knave   120.4468755548639
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier   43.29159127209486
what do you mean   53.319607390952584
in ten minutes it would strike seven   133.52233774981272
then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died   143.8343741105839
yes   201.83729776035278
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace   101.35892630402803
returned the influence of m   44.36792307480212
in the meantime we will have a merry night   131.4816536263714
now of two hundred and fifty one members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninety one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon   199.269393975464
look rather monsieur said d artagnan the clock shows it   67.21474948831704
the cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for anything in future   114.2991907855849
now said the count let us follow him   64.7899344736565
i set off for france after having fixed upon the plan   112.69121284495236
why he imprisoned himself i swear to you he did   32.472733955362614
estafania give up the keys of my drawers and my desks   202.2522997961495
yes since you have such a good memory   217.234498309101
certainly we are friends he replied   161.885599215002
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth   151.24137618341064
d avrigny continued to look at noirtier   27.00329008190829
at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared   78.75904257251271
if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis i really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de voiture   146.84374194868042
a paltry piece of business   96.7250917578415
said a swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer glass   39.83332405001461
good lord   169.52671173921323
this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime   21.081604749907285
but during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from madame de montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew not   165.3830222219641
easily said monte cristo   145.13896090508132
and i likewise said athos   210.57081064269238
but i want to know in what way m   18.164139234184404
i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and i wept   32.82283970202634
you are late my dear porthos   35.506852410042086
four conveyed him away i don t know where to the bastille or fort l evêque   133.02922584383302
this beverage required a good half hour to prepare   235.00980536073735
if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in   126.3530607579697
milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again   86.62538342086145
a poet is as good as an abbé   199.45503148909089
you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us   116.50795160631121
i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck   136.78774530899602
the 21st of september will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time arrives and it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to give you till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other   192.375391303862
nonsense said d artagnan   131.88418696642532
m   153.13618181879397
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room   110.55906176460199
luckily the man i had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so i took advantage of his silence to walk off   117.73181835962072
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried   158.81740665759622
f   139.5850420850716
do you wish for time to pay   77.49334988945475
but i do not think he has much claim to that title   88.00571882129324
said the young man   151.6436367831489
great god   118.16961154073778
my lord said the guard i have simply mentioned the prophecy i heard from a man named coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the duke of beaufort will escape before whitsuntide   131.1366504083314
i used all my influence with one of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to one of the galleries   68.82123869787327
is it you   185.2240022282789
he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain   120.66086661100084
is the deed of sale ready   116.38351119178951
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts   57.38648582643969
oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the sainte marguérite islands   78.45310626435459
yes   117.13252465604721
valentine chapter 103   74.22118059249948
instead of running after adventures i shall accept an invitation from porthos   92.41824120064014
and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow   201.70357011854261
and this gentleman is coming to live here   104.98892127295264
the executioner said d artagnan and aramis at the same time   155.24348516746522
yes monsieur quite ready said bazin   148.1072450677677
at these words which left no hope milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak   137.26907681303035
d avrigny   35.732266254001814
he opened a window and leaned out to listen   65.22646004831012
and he placed the bonds in his pocket book   151.7991308357867
help   111.7319131161404
don t worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to smile   88.61356961940959
pardon for what   46.91638309526863
himself my lord   162.15593311285642
let me see   166.3081879621852
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began   161.05135715845847
it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it   82.46954222656541
and i imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon her that i had imprinted upon my poor brother   157.68616352869293
it was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we promised   71.14191957297604
but beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were conducted   68.28360164975435
ah ah   166.16689398082644
he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the rest   171.84308634191606
a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators   116.7524659251603
i confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might   15.677672345848919
for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments   141.04746944038263
and then moreover what could happen to him   90.24114792603545
i faith   19.940790996759688
yes yes said the young man yes   167.61689715216733
he is alone said grimaud   12.895259261628524
well   54.17914413740294
i will not even ask who they are   94.55599229919446
i believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it   175.4403481198106
but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his feet   213.19457780051812
he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle   74.79464037173237
he was her grandfather on the mother s side   84.42372336872111
do you know the numbers   175.1242466318035
patience monseigneur we are coming to it   119.125371157504
said the englishman   128.61185811578477
bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo   109.63594899220799
old dantès who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleon s downfall   102.5835096555416
the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me   84.96617844493397
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m   90.5048747759901
said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair   67.42174670244097
ah   6.158003212636359
at the first words of this address d artagnan had seized porthos s arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force   35.16762332733728
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him   144.58790027693522
and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion   128.2504729402305
the telegraph chapter 61   56.16569421052936
come said andrea what do you want   15.401790893868025
today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father s and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at la réserve   148.96239063524197
not the same thing by any means   74.10666983801336
said athos and what puts you out of breath thus   77.36458100706898
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket   61.381712892569524

and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate   201.6213126318296
but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint méran despised all who were not noble   83.81683435774809
the lieutenant of musketeers   62.988160881049026
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given d artagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage   77.92893284300756
until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods   65.63335743028424
a woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex i am alarmed at the idea of civil war   145.50327479882972

the duchess was the first to speak   148.60014960987527
half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and economy   163.66738532828225
groslow s face brightened   116.1930442206964

the young man was overwhelmed as he read   108.4341161079342
it will not be so difficult replied d artagnan springing to the ground   205.0113647187097
my idea   244.4484421208262
convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine grimaud hastened to awake d artagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place   180.10280495610192
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared   110.53526358763102
their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threatenings   41.39164639486043

the same expression continued   77.82035639259524
we have fallen in with a party of spaniards   160.0987319386484
i wish to tell him to make my child happy   159.59339381711288
for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvre all which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it   120.54982543858513
and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied   91.66169089908004
yes said porthos let us take the opposite direction   39.23523262168874
the king motioned him to accompany them   180.0968215159235
the procurator s wife smiled thinking that it was for her porthos had put himself to this trouble   157.96834240625392
and one day i discovered that this woman was branded this woman was marked with a fleur de lis on her left shoulder   158.32335231738773

monsieur that my dear father is here   81.89947126755695
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco17 had done over the moor who would have killed him   107.26935064738402
i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth   38.438970452569535
cried bonacieux follow you at this hour   119.75944614638173
have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know   185.51793058401157
villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dantès patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleon s return   65.43344874241339
it was indeed for him that they were there   98.52063083982125
d artagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt   31.938919835498908
i remain here a day or two arrange accordingly   154.37305449823714
because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor   117.74622013929047

yes yes yes motioned the invalid   228.06931115328052
important ones   99.97392671905719
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea   59.233766577843944
but your eminence   146.9609402449289
the comte de rochefort   58.411918811915825
there you see it will not take long   144.10880439106242
why then have you laid it aside   120.83472075438766
but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days   230.1246377797989
a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating   122.87252413095669
divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown   251.37245416448042

he held a vial of salts in his hand   40.26627705656318
madame de villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other   124.91799574587195
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night   68.0466281817949
franz to provoke him and to fight with him   141.2563181448874
and you are not afraid of that athos   234.5905538047414
in this kind of game not to kill is to let one s self be killed   110.69186685138432
said d artagnan   97.00059632489298
the queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which d artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project   78.7059039835255
certainly i do   201.39744141142683
yanina   17.276216039638086

to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www   35.94948468886078
that is my grand story of the fair lady and when i relate that i must be very drunk   58.944374443776475
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation   238.19884361397635
can i not escape   116.25555824977104
but she is built to stand any weather   38.70215614905993
which of the two horses will you ride that which you bought or the one that was given to you   143.25172281456622
you were always a merry companion my dear d artagnan he said and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you   54.92576436256157
ah gentlemen   117.81199748522187
in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams   159.1152618815983
did i not tell you that she was the goddaughter of monsieur laporte the confidential man of the queen   94.56007646606977
that farewell struck madame de villefort like the executioner s knife   32.20322620322709
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name   64.77823474406881

it must be the son of mère simon who has stolen them   77.65285766159315
the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance   186.17946043742083
everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed   90.67261850185781
ah   13.123297262852205
demanded d artagnan   0.17456207915323319
but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to yield   76.93774528996653
look you may see it from here at the foot of that little hill that slated roof   197.91744681933005
unfortunately it is a thing that i can t perform at any time i choose   79.46430824393073
grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened   267.2878776096055
no on the faith of a cardinal   131.3320559394608
mazarin resumed his reading it is important therefore monseigneur that i should be informed as to the intentions of france   215.4832227610989
arrested   21.700830884334593
morrel and mercédès came to see him but his door was closed   67.54378873591001
you scoundrel   132.64765979450425
good evening m   102.4098863320416

it is quite wonderful said albert   0.7157500750508206
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face   167.81126302112776
meantime mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke   73.79517187682345
good by   201.79913821202973
and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes   196.95534655843286
if what you say is sincere replied athos he will never reach london   88.30032576445603
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret   77.6911382572863
he seemed moved by this last remark   65.4877201546175
said the count   103.85699681347829
i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for i was ashamed   146.1394598432654
we must let monsieur de beaufort come   221.3286522366255
who told you that i had been weeping   63.995797385473615
oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness itself   217.76179134816397
good bye   109.81519518109046
cried valentine   94.30272522098505
the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked d artagnan with an eloquent look   71.363748481746
said milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result   192.21432232515645
accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee   157.95342639679274
this sleep provincial as it was brought him to nine o clock in the morning   218.12452470826094
lackeys   128.79979637793699
the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket the major part of which arose from his winnings la vieuville said he take my place   50.72702070119914
monsieur d artagnan is in monsieur dessessart s guards and this gentleman is in the company of monsieur de tréville s musketeers   141.1021976879671
my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens   114.15042442148992
therefore i apply to you   105.51865750573528
toward midnight charles heard a great noise beneath his window   55.87830166307626
is he still one of the seventeen peers of france   147.98404042481638
the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom valentine s i am coming was the customary signal of farewell   101.5781445605815
and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour   166.38331565562538
ar † spada   125.41564088268203
but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you   93.29302774272941
but if she has good taste oh said monte cristo my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his father s position is good   186.6907016756902
i will not miss you   45.89822062320195
i did   179.49706029411595
at daybreak d artagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done   112.67609369914705
still the beatings of your heart   73.54836264764364
dantès appeared not to perceive him   72.77575540313443
in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study   123.83190910655206
one of our clients is a horsedealer   70.74679353052574
but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber   160.684940802716
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars   22.084707024703803
de tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m   62.9935240568295
of how many persons   35.27747484442811
the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass   124.42409737175569
ah to be sure replied château renaud   109.92718108262045
a boat   168.36167773945732
the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get along save yourselves   214.16660889498058
but i know my father s and can tell it to you   112.64530512052619
condé himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him   169.9892004105352
you sustained me powerfully sir and i protest to you that to day i feel very lonely   166.5388384068366
said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to milady   166.99843888916442
the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when danglars stopped her   83.97981659610039
patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france   167.46179071841573
take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad   89.71271303907682
that name sounds strange to you said athos smiling   10.355703864532927
it contained half a line in a hand perfectly british and with a conciseness as perfectly spartan thank you   66.45046803725143
ah   161.3309902786935
would you dare to lift your hand to your queen   168.5413092103719
but you will see him then   58.93337878855999
that is extremely kind of you said monte cristo with a tone of perfect indifference   168.48662127311303
i don t know what it was   78.63543131324587
good thought he   155.31842926347596
said danglars becoming pale   126.39175543604287
they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads lowered   108.07136673174922
ah yes indeed said monte cristo with a sigh   166.71404555967104
a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded   180.69590285512078
you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly   167.07357306547704
said d artagnan   122.4842539823568
besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent   116.45998600137906
at the court which raoul had never seen   131.62549056226845
i have been the cause of all your misfortunes   97.90234172285473
dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous   129.64962224139722
yes it is very annoying said vampa   194.25105395802626
but hush here comes our minister of justice   145.0959975053448
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem   126.46611828720826
he came twice to milady s   98.76850405819756
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based   8.120021496609922
if not unpleasant to you   155.07110414382728
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends   73.63336495054327
on   183.33142352277105
and the illustrious what s the name of the lad whom i made a sergeant in piedmont s regiment   153.91664192808764
her mistress was mad with love intoxicated with joy   178.66518754570072
i will tell him what i have seen and we will consult together and examine the body   102.43957603996292
the king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle   194.15517853838708
noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison   113.6347508234663

the suicide chapter 93   128.6714163432085
i told you said mazarin that you had seen the queen   120.31565032798079
if that is the case i warn you i shall have you put in a lunatic asylum   118.56540209257886

you are my landlord   113.35977638128696
but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chained up dog went up to the cabin   138.57460667208076
grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon   141.80157465676666
how does it happen then that he is in your service   215.6631526624809
meanwhile the heat became excessive   89.04412726334253
it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty   97.10495315006072

the hypocrite   150.3644726565317
it is not courage that is needed   94.23329115627868
to sea   34.846021603962754
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word   66.65917874226142
he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber   116.04961686680981
the last two mounted guard at the door during this examination   135.50331725134834
the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features   80.56016966962989
and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbé busoni   79.78348643773967
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends   198.73437131404194
he approached the wall and tried to climb it   68.37722129529709
are you there now   126.16651814338752
we ought to die together   227.1678520002465
0323m like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display   164.10158813246605
a delicious torpor permeated every vein   174.12346552723534
have you really no desire to meet him   72.39417182156012
he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and pardieu   103.04024652870139
people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven   134.26453993640504
the king will be delivered at the tribunal said athos   135.78842690659317
i descended rapidly   102.59993071357475
take one of the carriage lamps bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments   146.39007431450744
but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends   196.5888421786612
you say either too much or too little   165.31219448284028
but why have you not fled   185.81811271153543
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer   149.85510221244908
and i even think he recognizes me   69.42647675348496
milady was a phantom which when it had once appeared to people did not allow them to sleep very quietly   103.1966506887296
i don t want any supper said caderousse   134.57873841165633
porthos wanted to lengthen out his names mousqueton to cut his short   98.22913414848257
valentine rose to fetch the dictionary   121.91321266143912
and the yacht   125.64985823780644
where is he   64.83284287787461
you are right   9.933593575048974
50137m but then you are rich very rich indeed continued debray taking out some papers from his pocket book which he spread upon the table   164.1182038922644
i have had no occasion to notice him particularly   62.80575562978099
that was all   115.87260204617445
don t tell me you are perplexed what to do   51.561397854552126
lansquenet for instance   163.18085264527082
it seemed to him a dream   79.29407535170739
there they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted bethune and stationed himself between cambria and la venthie   74.08666740295975
bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance   99.95214025680431
some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel   77.31002949158514
i wished to make an effort   81.23021588216751
the count listened and said no more   127.34004267463597
20301m our expedition made a favorable beginning   150.36109856975878
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek   194.53136301530566
noirtier sent for me i am ready to attend to his wish   276.629334912002
edward you naughty boy exclaimed madame de villefort snatching the mutilated book from the urchin s grasp you are positively past bearing   3.295777180079469
but not knowing you would come to see me i had made an engagement with a friend   201.60988808525354
planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment   154.9409596754515
and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate   63.689198660922656
your uncle   77.46475623329684
yes once   196.17791552245203
exclaimed raoul here you are at last   73.45299104023563
asked beauchamp   90.73046720367793
and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped   184.11361854588955
that is what deceives you debray   90.76539418515625
come he said tis a warning from heaven   106.33233392061194
de saint méran is dead   123.39113346362988
the judge chapter 109   119.93801462331513
valentine tell him if you love maximilian   137.8640813738661
aramis burst into a fit of laughter   102.23947605288257
we shall then be matched four against the remaining five   172.14081221766165
oh yes it is she   99.89135670931553
if m   140.6849877624439
until this day and for how long a time   98.36089435617066
villefort could not believe his eyes he could not believe his reason   20.054920218159708
you love   42.45815630195689
yes   44.604376997394226
ah   29.071009617883192
the middle window at the café rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red cross   146.0908237419324
said the man   129.52902705057213
hush   190.0293216539876
oh you may speak before his excellency said he   48.53032254446174
well very good   216.38266330259046
the waiter had no suspicions   87.99780871775484
charles stuart had asked that bishop juxon might be permitted to visit him   171.15388816340865
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house   323.1398799183392
you well know edmond that i am no longer a reasoning creature   112.67081809311189
cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself   63.89438729656759
this is the gentleman i am going to fight with said athos pointing to d artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture   171.81004714730773
coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further   83.65894849948342
said groslow   229.04212716484506
but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act   73.64208014015428
i was   116.00374475121815
said the cashier   136.48285878787655
yes   107.83184374587874
but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that dandré was irrevocably lost   169.77160518694822
i wish you to obtain for me from monsieur dessessart leave of absence for fifteen days   82.50624668509633
ah   58.81453003813234
and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it   173.83795195366446
we look hideous said athos   146.93286749015618
what are you no longer in possession of your senses   120.17462434525522
it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur   152.83044299559847
help help   156.86554765985838
40276m listen said the baroness smiling   141.95286017997884
then walking towards morrel he took his hand   286.1456693969976
well what s the matter   161.62460686461628
unluckily as i was then in bearn on account of my father s death the letter followed me there   71.36346676952776
and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb they had vanished at his waking   58.184166255433
de villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon   167.6296787996105
weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase   90.27560507438362
how could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many men   133.79681878607573
you have succeeded   36.51860354988321
we shall be murdered there said aramis   235.6506248694802
ah madame de chevreuse was less cruel than you   66.84417390337512
i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest   87.96057900720001
and king charles is well as i have just heard   95.0935773094431
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy   10.975410797212504
to return when d artagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure   136.50648254637366
i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville   115.3522929369976
50183m are you looking for anything mr   10.793573433731751
a don quixote without his corselet without his coat of mail without his cuisses   104.98151465484565
all right all right said the jailer   141.87929164654045
if i had had a single ornament left i should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself   139.0281825621354
a single portrait signed by léopold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame   105.55650915972426
but you speak of him not of his party his resources   210.7982675577054
she inquired for the convent of the carmelites and went thither immediately   92.29766216651284
yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a religious tendency   88.12711216269369
how much is it worth   149.76669069823615
fortunately i have them though said monte cristo   161.4778077346757
oh you may even see her if you like my dear mr   178.1489588010595
in the first place i was four years making the tools i possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself   99.9867767524661
madame morrel looked again through the keyhole morrel was writing   171.72762740490506
yes i recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night crying to my soul which can not sleep strike save england save thyself for thou wilt die without having appeased god   114.73869123309981
but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze   134.39443822770897
you are insane monsieur   117.62339418204672
yes returned morcerf a baron of a new creation   152.58328711288806
it is too late said mazarin tearing his hair too late   119.33378329357873
edmond was intensely interested   175.51936359868913
asked aramis   28.95989652276853
while the august spouse of your majesty is anne of austria queen of france that is to say one of the greatest princesses in the world   113.4442828698367
saved said the girl   34.925669529187545
at this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard   88.2988593620032
i would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself   73.78642087862633
monte cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said come gentlemen some coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn   123.05612506840693
during this time porthos played close   134.9638109195721
well my friend i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much   90.29514783094018
dead or desperately wounded as i left without having been able to hear anything of him   148.72600429511115
he who was but half as old would sacrifice six   154.0215928108296
and madame de saint méran have died   145.5162969526678
this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit   123.59882431652603
now as i am not egotistical we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her   170.6571958334912
and is it not that he may never do us any harm   122.11764740632665
then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you   105.4147681331821
yes monsieur in this house   84.52101948797923
oh where will be the end   178.34209357665634
he is at my house   111.4073473572644
seriously said gondy astonished at not having further advanced   61.206711124299666
his charities alone amount to 20 000 francs a month   5.367765088730437
and the crew   149.11104658167886
what do you want   71.22117744625685
albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots   192.96924623137753
now i can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it   115.21151904692454
grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole   100.55505371880659
you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way   96.21077554473925
a soldier of the usurper then   173.56864023020796
inquired gaetano   91.4113135226309
is it large   133.27663945015706
keep near me said the latter   136.2275797205403
you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria   35.99225454511787
courage we have them   121.95697957132089
i will slay you   48.87505845403733
oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it   182.62883982793585
20222m it was   215.31804232120547
we will keep on the frontiers for instance   118.492535095047
pardon me my god   185.38544148195396
at nine o clock the next morning the drums beat to arms   146.53117418295523
one from love and the other from ambition fernand and danglars   174.9533968031021
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly   185.44207299187576
you will allow me to leave first   124.93595621299077
no no she answered i would rather remain here   24.232010470614455
for stealing   188.70743911200913
it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions   102.5029054748863
avenge me of that infamous de wardes said milady between her teeth and i shall soon know how to get rid of you you double idiot you animated sword blade   149.93005709887552
athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress   127.05440843987606
yes yes   135.87375335578517
the jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs   223.65691951706984
keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nîmes   185.13214064111781
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full speed   109.55162808599646
the lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left   45.05956009383472
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king   223.5079499682779
it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant   106.18669254402522
i am commandant of the port   94.10951691925936
do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over   59.7575882907327
the lions den one division of la force in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined is called the court of saint bernard   185.08598720519257
oh man   163.21819418375094
for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis   158.89542074297566
having passed through the rue du mont blanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the rue la fayette   169.57371497406703
albert related it to his mother   241.8694901114257
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied   137.14261889875024
make yourself at home   72.8002264772052
another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villefort s bedroom   46.924281785610006
what do you not know your house   192.09684919570162
30327m she then turned towards the avenue   116.44819719508553
madame said the young man bowing   128.57347395789955
but of what disease then did she die   31.92295843142911
the duc d elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty five thousand for each of the three others   137.84403435700992
for as i am a good catholic i firmly believe i am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman   211.6943860937102
now said valentine motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstool now let us talk about our own affairs   145.04724611823386
the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again rummaging and rerummaging in his valise and opening and reopening his purse   140.72779867872256
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement   50.459124514326874
doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head   94.30562974992259
you are joking yourself now   135.77801925942475
on the seventh of january between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property   122.04410028488547
my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that s a fair bet i hope   108.84370038782686
my god my lord i have long despised thee   214.6343620991056
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could   149.9193815264821
it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the garden hedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence   167.3081065247349
very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent english   172.58257487190497
oh yes   105.35744865720702
inquired the count   85.61165705195891
you were not of the party m   165.29718984134055
certainly   88.89118331638525
morrel i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you   175.25619781052885
you are joking   163.9769485453872
i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm   199.95143579736674
but then hereditary rank is abolished   60.843448216187866
then he added in a low tone yes   154.9527768479456
no said maximilian you shall not leave him   76.91552513765791
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him   142.94349599357048
a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart   20.31054893639761
whither goes she   45.85475308831984
bonacieux recovered her senses   54.43998517963766
some sang ballads about mme   74.13930719276141
and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf   281.09442594940697

the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head   168.81352274626016
d artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver   6.927047619263277

a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing   81.8706059554232
asked the countess   117.25230413832159
and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him   235.83842446930905

the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg™ trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation   162.31567880026984

the superior education of dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy   142.77416788838477
my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us   103.46685378776367
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more   77.52271315348449

i am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the banker   98.38763854849067

i say captain said the sailor who had cried courage   183.28202366814617

in good time   85.26789294435531
it is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the doctor   51.14732049007792
the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck friends taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other some weeping others noisy in their grief the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of maximilian from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay   119.4241158525761
both resumed their way   12.371370541627655
the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of de luynes   187.50014571892353

madame de longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty   169.7348881491182
madame de lannoy then is of opinion that she gave them to buckingham   110.60727113258643
a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell   213.1395979496535
one   30.405809523445825

he exclaimed   64.87324777459844

yes yes very sure   16.69962759012867
the position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his difficulties   69.97311526143673
that is the reply i beg you to make to lord de winter   97.70595169034664
40196m yes was the unanimous answer   93.49956231937833
but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger s   36.219723271747526
agitated by fear torn by faction   146.77168466113983
at least i can t now recall it   82.74270114976211
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already three quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest   110.82427317495271
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated   98.81363656635051
pardieu   133.90441908132502
and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were   60.146650016635796
albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice   102.59994351454334
my dear aramis you have the pen of a secretary of state   85.12351464447764
now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away   65.76846144936812
before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion   166.66798699720806
besides i must think of my outfit   120.06065634140656
turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move   33.32895411258001
you can understand honored and dear guardian how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that i have passed with you   166.09908926680822

every minute athos was forced to restrain d artagnan constantly in advance of the little troop and to beg him to keep in the line which in an instant he again departed from   148.78691679925427
i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand   29.594658274951485
said the abbé   89.82262672458015
every one likes his own uniform best my lord   163.35684042016916
a woman of mark   186.87486836916776
but queen henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions crossed the cabinet opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinal s numerous guards courtiers eager to pay homage the luxurious show of a competing royalty she went and took the hand of de winter who stood apart in isolation   148.06843648632858
i am mistaken   112.16355784420605
as to that no replied athos laughing   177.4571494085063

they were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children   18.8632081289075
very well said albert extending his hand   76.01181768404396
yes said porthos   166.33365222566684
but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure   66.43527815827662
he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken   146.08226850021939

then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper   144.84321927878466
i will arm him against love   180.07934162219726

whom heaven protect from evil   14.764373163573936
good bye then   90.17906470477024

the two friends were in the via dei pontefici   19.582651659443655
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed unless   93.82266493398009

monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord   72.21311329880331
the frenchman knocked at the inner door and entered the first room   151.86828468476875
the deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of marseilles when one morning his door opened and m   115.59600540511846
killed him or poniarded him sir as is most agreeable to you   118.96403357994257

my sister how did your husband die   174.9231182768347
monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificent pistols   66.73800419782611
i am planchet planchet whom you know well   30.716027892574587
they would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me   153.25116084098343
exclaimed the count   80.26904137163096
good   35.24321680369172
no one had the slightest suspicion   199.13380468488475
for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened   75.40164313939289
count andrea cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow   297.52203331780754
without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with   45.27065972818184

yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for monsieur de bracieux is rich   225.3952778094193
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale   81.0932840391989
you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hands going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me   157.55480885166327
mazarin did not even turn around   217.93038262191317
have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence   44.00889130003422
bertuccio said the count   62.236596584255416
we shall go together shall we not   217.45596545977526
on the entrance of the new comers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising   63.315916975271804
a young and beautiful girl with hair as black as jet her eyes as velvety as the gazelle s was leaning with her back against the wainscot rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor   101.36864191890031

yes said morrel smiling it was the 5th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved   3.0961111960695717
i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much   67.81881393477616
besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum   72.36239466150913
he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it   68.72611506443114
maximilian morrel captain of spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest officers   94.0690948634437

alas sir replied the queen i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions   128.43729377691918
give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on   128.31041812445503
it was d artagnan who now shook his head in his turn   119.28306348191545
but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady s chamber   130.72421076570137
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foot s pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles   129.0691754383325
d artagnan entered behind him   145.43282029650462

d artagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind   162.03562912632535
d artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere   50.58745916986483
whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you   119.29038207091979
there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are   144.70141406340778
yes   75.18027904144353
speak   169.29010985617262
leave me to pray   115.9959196567245
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring   25.115996881721458
for unpaid wages   114.32002727030846
although shaded by sorrow he knows everything i know said she   128.14439300856827
faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed   181.62960153674499
and with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day d artagnan directed his course toward m   204.0107292000967
buckingham was their messiah   100.41804337566427
debray s name is mixed up in this affair   173.57914382355446
i have avenged myself   153.63953508687868
mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain   113.45336568010569
well let that care be mine and be at ease   81.6285663827895
he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas   165.85182004739147
asked the abbé   187.7013571832441
and yet said porthos   133.05539876849815
i promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner   162.87555422504087
i use either hand easily   77.9406279900609
d artagnan found his advice prudent   140.30876425275764
look at m   119.23933012932085
said the cardinal in a low voice   148.06176820705244
and at the third she expired   186.76606440392666
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived but have you only two days of leave raoul   69.83252211804577
but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better   67.01676413634453
he could not be mistaken   131.04645362115758
this child lives and someone knows it lives someone is in possession of our secret   117.52576785958976
but m   136.9177988160829
i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i   6.012858129593795
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else   78.42758023333995
in his convent   154.0951404835269
i will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation   66.96637618712668
franz d épinay   105.29894661805601
if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of france   171.05510017502553
d artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers   81.84291013598167
it appears so said athos since here they are   39.634391792034535
and though i have been through twelve pitched battles and i can not count how many charges and skirmishes i own for the third time in my life i was afraid   104.59956923469014
i avenge myself   134.85075278907814
de tréville was asking d artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour   164.59221666383877
but can not one learn philosophy   175.98788238926997
what does your worship want   138.66058857088234
m   89.75450291710959
while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate   148.97144703757039
under the cuirass the hump will not be seen   147.38460798274252
my hôtel will be always open to you   170.1665037493886
you will be served thus madame three times a day said he   104.24648809119336
oh   112.61533632877455
we will see gentlemen we will see   95.5037750615729
the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands   119.63403899379365
welcome to you i expected you   101.35581310862919
yes   166.92243863790742
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal   190.37599198759037
chapter 87   105.10693695388706
how can i tell you   279.2370957473016
undoubtedly i know it but it is a mystery   142.043761347688
here i am at your eminence s service as well as monsieur du vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of porthos   85.14322395337355
well now listen   209.10654336374017
he has already been invited by my father   136.75185716021855
m   69.18725414850691
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs   65.70497310421217
your name   129.3049095531635
but what sort of madness was it   103.79695520019267
it was not i who killed him said athos in a soft low tone twas destiny   67.46973649810204
ah   173.18316809580244
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass   148.90960411954808
i   68.45409644776431
yet i have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy   167.71464920438038
i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years   78.67896073923896
beauchamp s i found madame in tears   179.3169300933035
you must change your clothes as calypso said to telemachus   21.951820773320364
a porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau   82.30910676529365
but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it   133.95052450301927
the puritan then went out   34.26987959163549
de morcerf sets you the example   205.4858335244689
he was a dead man   102.08276947047403
cried the brigands   72.4878830436073
so preferring death to capture i accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution   142.2100948573135
as for me you must know i can not possibly live out of lucca   69.50832871540763
no no she vociferated no you can not wish that   175.14097557943572
the three musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses   149.82775202773797
i mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion   93.89842328991608
at nine o clock madame la première présidente arrived   97.21222076381389
after charles i   88.34577258403475
your majesty has given me the control of this business   145.45981996353092
monseigneur   180.80467925464302
he then laid him down on the floor where d artagnan after giving him just time enough to draw his breath gagged him with his long scarf   44.68997800771177
besides the parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few days   93.70434671513162
it is m   10.659593802076287
said the host aside   229.57153307106051
certainly   116.12479733830173
his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket   163.26439481578552
oh it would be a sacrilege   96.73624533252644
1   249.44678312875166
oh death is in my house   70.50149311738743
but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too late   176.06347266069514
cried athos   173.71155618480668
but two million francs make a nice little sum replied morcerf   175.37521422863327
still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders   153.93679378624722
i fire first   100.59833475693726
oh that is quite another thing then   93.04095444556589
go away from here   105.75315739315515
you are stupid replied the cardinal   129.32701584496562
asked mousqueton rather uneasy   164.1461001887075
decidedly monsieur d artagnan you are the man i have been seeking   62.59158470326495
only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen   130.8547484609406
there is the true reason   269.33865851562973
this man was surrounded by officers   87.59135819872579
that house is suspected tréville said the king   88.75072264417551
chapter lvi   108.73839760279773
on guard then monsieur on guard   167.68079753743376
one night however i heard his sobs and i could not resist my desire to go up to him but when i reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying   72.62304911226575

villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word   157.16125993018733
the answer known he had yielded to albert s wish to be introduced to haydée and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali and had not opposed haydée s recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate morcerf s father   14.13372051335159
when you arrived here i allowed you to enter   83.15693770803526
you seem secretly elated   6.543753072869109
the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of   7.446244182409842
what was i saying   87.01776731652302
bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her knees   140.3330181450461
well then let us go i must trust to you   102.87617828643668
danglars appeared delighted with you was he not   150.1348217680447
maximilian s avowal at the same moment m   250.9607087988283
yes   205.02330662027344
m   98.94060702669495
to you also   98.39908984350585
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor s answer   112.87434819616344
i have spoken to you indiscreetly about danglars   69.58690100953729
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway   133.02748348998924
cried comminges   193.5428429740214
no sir i am alone in the world   138.60155719558958
then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of   152.07723493907446

the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his   190.53789302530663
without revealing himself   156.07571327340378
ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine   241.3236871557253
he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol   80.91185877316653
aramis   107.75326784417172
monsieur porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains   174.93701714163564
he then related the adventure of meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m   81.27436913763387
this was groslow   251.17028924230445
matters go but badly said athos smiling   108.31368663662435
do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port   37.29616543484981
he was hungry   88.10544056181476
and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed   147.32027272898767
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind   81.54545037338858
mousqueton also attracted attention   92.64912695007038
besides every millionaire is as noble as a bastard that is he can be   122.63819716375757
one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing   129.8638663917813
here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following   54.009867914193805
thank you and god reward you   211.36676690547785
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st   193.58582876485897
d artagnan had passed himself upon her as de wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her character   71.16666595988784
some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more   32.27203488979784
possibly   136.23534726705302
40134m yes since i bring you your two hundred francs   89.12187306680862
but jest as he might he gained nothing   57.87560592797073
the man whipped his animals which cleared a way through the crowd   208.2579801817227
to take the hundred pistoles d artagnan   53.60171119135561
buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said within six months if i am not dead i shall have seen you again madame even if i have to overturn the world   110.9387543557391
the blush of pride mounted to the count s forehead as this thought passed through his mind   144.67227234092738
are you satisfied gentlemen   117.00953602672365
we will judge you in spite of your silence   142.2595203372311
it was proposed for the museum   56.29333772305216
this was the same emery who became eventually superintendent of finance   205.5032667673387
the fowl pecked at the rabbit and the next day was a dead hen   58.323771850313875
said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer   204.22690427939807
ah maximilian i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend   10.119823900974922
7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder   150.8891131628764
and now raoul said he you are launched   147.54271106900606
let us leave them she said   87.43914633309592
sulpice   129.62062978331852
but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat   111.64297413555289
oh no monsieur he is very young   49.301672192101705
porthos aramis and d artagnan followed his example   50.95516736747467
after which they withdrew   134.9326300517433
one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita   60.303374084278545
ah my faith yes   71.23502696097393
but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed   102.15134399444628
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish   86.97173731457133
with this cloak you will not be cold   127.36020259085623
continued milady   93.15453899887433
we hastened to obey this order   206.5632218362364
the young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his horse   164.45238289018872
well those studs continued mme   51.16496352004462
as to his going or staying i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions   254.31174487778463
do not exaggerate your duty   216.72590529283374
how long   1.600711397517287
with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it   132.5261636944572
i have an order for each of you also   150.48546407620876
for from the moment i have either listened to or heard them i shall be held as an accomplice   192.49604422308795
first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle you   128.2275172860483
not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories   175.30270462133848
the stairs did indeed lead to the garden   148.69079865490372
and since he is italian i will myself continue the examination   109.35668551216
my father is the marechal de grammont   65.10152285466162
sir replied haydée the count of monte cristo my foster father has been in normandy the last three days   169.56280448826607
asked porthos   136.38960062616283
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders   117.66668105602523
cried villefort   87.88628920170703
we can not say how long the night seemed to milady but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness   96.53926369265947
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness   156.7012641387064
yes   68.91657574145317
ah   73.21820015684833
when the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed   79.6788288242703
the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc   77.09038810465535
the procurator s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud all surrounded by duchesses and marchionesses who cast bags of money at his feet   202.8476601902462
give him some more wine fernand   189.42288138880366
he was born at pampinara and entered the count s service when he was five years old   172.19114976010437
three quarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him   97.35658530358847
yes   74.4781720550906
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously   122.09971296687263
a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn   167.4895510541499
and then some son in law or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a king   42.80514738987726
absolutely nothing   121.89497608717676
who will tell her   150.5588612053135
on the other bank replied the executioner   23.042928127754152
in the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinal s will   52.13962517984187
it was his cornelius nepos that master edward was repeating when he referred to king mithridates continued the count and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him for your son is really advanced for his years   88.70955592050413
e   143.22339485873593
what are you doing reverend sir   168.23938961683314
yes   229.41765261710378
and that other gentleman   57.431505073614936
you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what i should call becoming your accomplice   167.8375763113694
yes yes indeed   108.65197966114928
i will offer myself as floor polisher   116.66311926206687
but with that perfect self possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria dantès coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation   47.2130823142877
i never heard it   104.98999946641572
mother he said turning towards mercédès this is m   135.44968572806087
when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said it appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone   88.62233220331689
what   85.7826590936051
ah   60.21065861893955
ah said andrea when may we hope for that pleasure   35.04615336753753
at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance   58.407507289024025
i have suffered deeply madame answered monte cristo   124.01702157605538
but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit down   174.84261460873293
i shall be happy to meet you again sir   26.060853835222474
in fact the procession arrived in safety at notre dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a te deum   139.91414003559632
i am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so i keep him   184.97426341448931
yes yes   186.60988366848818
said athos   202.28421020966036
asked penelon   7.203344916635928
thank you edmond   110.83833626151771
he was called benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents   166.33519740010138
for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me   137.7374040853096
she was the exact duplicate of the other pharaon and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo   70.19398138065475
the enemy s army extended from cassel to courtray   121.60243911518943
for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance   75.11255183851802
he listened nothing more   134.17969724626795
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch   120.76912369012692
50073m no said valentine   66.04904809725045
but what could these men whom i at first took for robbers want with me and why is monsieur bonacieux not here   67.11187598394709
i beg of your majesty then said athos calmly and not replying to mazarin to quash these arrests of messieurs d artagnan and du vallon   69.19643576815278
neither had any   78.96209193815113
have you not said that that abduction was entirely political   126.00844278630015
reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming storm and when they pass athwart a multitude presage an emeute   23.527735609384507
well then i don t know   244.44825317983006
ah   107.7907518095621
madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features   163.30486240665107
to no one on my honor   97.64746325637611
monte cristo perceived that the young man had turned around   121.2589823680897
this is all very strange said m   114.06715085488325
as we pass from one room to another i will open the windows to let you breathe   200.3974936192019
but it was on leaving this club said he my father disappeared   215.76945880461324
and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure   144.82150968784148
but you have made my mouth water   106.76098820167716
oh oh   100.86892115001133
asked athos   73.15372729037901
halloo gentlemen   92.82724321586362
nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that i could wish   171.3277354451656
besides i am here in my own country and that excites me   85.39883365040313
at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten   131.61179515061224
this menace smothered the young man s passion   50.89279255493106
madame replied athos i have only to ask your majesty s prayers   224.80397163401452
we don t know the locality and shall never find the wall   65.26161209482117
cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes   74.74338974505014
exclaimed porthos mutton again   139.00329482710066
this woman must be tried not assassinated   82.68046169025246
40130m no he wished to speak to your excellency   100.58571314642136
replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time   80.92787535925319
the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window   108.53570027960083
if you prefer another name it   172.17810670936916
the tower of st   44.16028858439941
that s true   132.6811930687809
indeed beauchamp you are unbearable   152.86212644769296
the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering   95.04817008490053
but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage   130.50018882377572
thirty forty fifty sixty five men said porthos counting the reinforcements   154.6200705155435
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms   92.3097456614893
your ruin   87.38992259242315
and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it   111.25468561699374
maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed him   22.220289491356652
a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes   221.4063269158144
did he tell you so   115.17728279155006
some nabob from india was his comment   127.55573757809549
but how comes the diamond in your possession sir   85.33074251111177
ah   125.52723772225714
my faith   71.38450918022184
suspicion instantly seized me   139.64620048908841
replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe   177.4390068009876
chapter lxxxiii   54.599397669116065
they had a youth with them   72.5437983407312
let us go to the king   35.62763397054431
asked she   154.84437662027833
i know him   38.48530438223533
a child encumbers a fugitive   112.62222456092195
when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered you my heart was softened   3.1203407094899376
wait he continued renewing his fruitless search   186.70898497480064
yes if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief   102.14811738638757
what to do with him   140.4917894884827
tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreuse he may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful   92.81159233878874
the baroness did not wait for a repetition   97.66341149186894
but it was locked maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the glass   190.83685078426385
the name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up   121.60596760606342
cried the musketeer as if he had received a ball in his heart   77.82755054368118
yet replied carlini   143.2858991021081
the next morn broke off the coast of aleria   140.64450853815796
i have two friends who in this way never depart from me   92.07981084949219
in that case said d artagnan i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence   186.97691023665809
planchet turned and returned the billet   101.70658160396273
tell m   87.88059348166746
50277m let it be then as you wish sweet angel   81.89337115521366
monsieur still insists upon seeing him   175.53625589824824
then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event   64.06259708538444
franz d épinay   111.70899017679531
demanded the notary thinking he had only to insert this clause but waiting first for the assent of noirtier which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene   86.30567628257769
do you think so   76.59801031777914
athos glanced at aramis   189.52905805617138
i feel it monsieur and that impels me on   110.08822457431219
but it is the wretched that man can not injure me haydée said monte cristo   79.83248114240041
i think nothing my friend   118.78145682486151
cried the young man turning pale   166.88734582295228
maximilian s avowal chapter 95   198.92743122676876
some wine   11.550978177283284
d artagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his eyes   44.03894935409963
mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner   124.3835454184913
there are tears in your eyes   210.82400956524572
i speak to you in french said d artagnan   74.89509409488117
you are welcome gentlemen she said   125.25649439405981
the great are often ungrateful   27.55765893533257
it is one of my friends who loves her monsieur athos this gentleman here   114.32936451310567
your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and i could say to you as that good la ramee said to me of the duc de beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out   133.13911578262946
he cherished the thought of the duel hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds   71.47480109390268
at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open   147.4506263929665
cried mazarin   184.44833929916535
de villefort altered his intention   170.20336599958998
and my faith the governor of the province one of the gentlemen i expected today seemed to have such a wish for him that i gave him to him   32.90128920693468
de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man   142.17278085399488
that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence   63.66466883893695
raoul   171.76432417019288
why to accuse the man do you address the woman   161.83644145006699
and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities   88.22371271219271
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses   164.55255819956108
20335m i have the honor i presume of addressing m   121.90823895794374
replied the stranger knitting his brow   111.6564246489302
said the cardinal   63.34827630435872
cried d artagnan   73.05865728526918
the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dantès question   220.02729256922396
with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors   79.55435508319634
to the health of the king monsieur   143.35056922260898
you will not oppose m   159.61487903261826
but continued d artagnan you shall judge of him for yourself   10.394774567798493
the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held   11.147036262169792
two years   209.06131397156543
said andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls   100.87591798619482
said louise looking at her with admiration   203.759501227272
yes you are right   133.95988828993163
rochefort remained for a moment in thought   116.58721790057727
very fine anne   120.90831460992541
when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved   121.03753105688217
he knew that it was barren and without shelter   158.98758534026933
what are these things   193.48898847854485
no maximilian it is not suitors to which madame de villefort objects it is marriage itself   39.35169192866158
besides it does not seem very dangerous   137.48186648037168
come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly   175.981628291098
sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law   112.17731070821392
20061m saved my child   133.6726547116973
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the foundation or pglaf owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg™ electronic works   118.75393052886137
frightful   35.53567717805379
it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts   169.12995035130808
i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first   137.74799454782732
no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion   131.31005555137145
and why not   185.6449612033386
we are friends are we not   141.0236458017991
you should not ask a stranger a foreigner for news   76.7743273885825
all the four are at your service   102.67720237265657
from whom   43.56380157388082
guilty   161.26122989840673
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been   117.4584131202438
do you know my friend i find one thing very evident in all this you distrust me   172.49175783561213
at this moment comminges rushed into the room   109.13528307169197
one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting   154.47738447280437
thanks my lord   57.494270922135925
it belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us   243.9185481842608
i must find them within three days   70.08994379184543
willingly answered the stranger   34.612208898850184
go and rejoin your mother and sister   96.69841640745746
that is to say you would rather not   126.61401524538559
i believe by heaven said d artagnan that i shall embrace him since he s upon our road   147.35903092085186
i must leave you said du tremblay   180.11835973318438
he also was dying of hunger   125.05383685663074
then it is understood said d artagnan   72.42445479120428
demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word   50.69639537085348
i am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard   73.85769502649126
i   140.55188084511664
wait   197.49800399061496
it is a quarter of an hour s journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hour s journey from the city to hither   56.93609860868945
and then having found nothing returned   270.88340020570536
you know you may say anything to me   49.182820335850906
then from hunger by sharing with me guess what   137.85153960789063
selim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali   99.23696605468916
monte cristo pressed his hands to his forehead   59.37072629909104
but on your account i will add some eggs and that is a serious infraction of the rule for eggs are meat since they engender chickens   27.581715011683315
he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials   139.86659288082714
the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely   25.104805238439113
and although i was certain he was at home he would not make any answer   46.39963917958174
we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them   189.82314977972004
ah my dear father   118.34792838045087
d artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying let us go   172.9800229256928
the count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon morrel upon the first occasion   96.78853240716452
this was all that milady could endure   149.1242417294615
i had three two of whom have left paris to go i know not where   122.22511981264144
is he afraid of me or of his father   159.33002149363574
but remorse is not thus banished   31.06916686777103
she would have seduced a saint   151.22628268454292
certainly   110.47261518667788
it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocence it is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it   136.81472116650565
and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying   102.47301602681219
and charles i   48.112718764794764
i received the news this evening by a courier   129.29019074391928
what the devil   232.06670904360456
in half an hour   52.39494779455596
but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other s arms   89.39569855322792
and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son   69.76096248587768
murmured the count of morcerf   110.86006265234799
another might threaten to seek m   61.06350491106768
i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese   114.90385773932891
i am myself a frenchman   130.79783733738356
the two children grew up together passing all their time with each other and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters   144.0700001366256
yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune   77.71709220595906
porthos told him of it in his calm manner   105.07642193055152
on the contrary do not look at him but at this   64.05567383243512
speak out there s a worthy fellow   207.6838172915912
tell us   92.10598548410971
then without taking any thought for their future he returned to porthos and told him that his commission was completed   68.03790024461222
my mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her   129.4741478613019
again interposed some of the audience   12.24856929252303
well   116.41309940117092
you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion   181.49726832590977
you sent for me   156.0153764084129
no everyone would do that   135.67441452221397
at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king   76.24775079820961
only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile   157.92048277371325
now through this ventilating hole i throw my lasso and as i now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine that s my point for sport   129.04329379742657
almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs   173.75999901779286
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick   87.15352333043356
listen continued villefort   87.11487694112687
they are destined to produce at least ten   119.24170744272287
de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held   84.94494283210608
indeed   162.28907772087936
whispered planchet   1.9199213080728157
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn   127.33796808845445
all night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way   220.1704528441869
your comrade   172.8035607748592
in the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held   131.56353708083617

andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor   22.833761937021308
adieu then until five o clock   209.83683793863258

villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper   136.5204338996293
in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular being   84.5957761808469
valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy   50.276245897314084
mine also are from him   68.58880927025993
let us see said d artagnan   119.60884830313871

then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden   139.2591665584536
then turning to noirtier do you hope the assassin will be tried   108.47091614487405

but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair   144.2326298520524
bonacieux lived on very quietly wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife and caring very little about it   173.10715172431074
the count praised bertuccio s zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month   172.90530710020928

you know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor broussel the father of the people   117.32751356971968
there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage   117.56407749578506
continued he   193.6408031392445
and d artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one   59.31836390193521
caderousse became thoughtful   96.68291785343443
said athos   105.29339451978399
to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte   81.78885572390857

edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead man s face   84.50017231118305
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him   107.3899852150617
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables   119.14400183364451
whatever crimes they may have committed for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of god   109.30615674147897
upon reaching the room below i found five or six custom house officers and two or three gendarmes all heavily armed   118.28970128913384

gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray château renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m   137.00484293939968
you and your friend are worth an army   284.9679104831532
and you understand heraldry   35.470259511396605
everyone looked at carlini   147.67940253285568
we do what we can   112.89160772927814
but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray   163.41644949145112
he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden sent away barrois and after having seated himself at his father s right hand while madame de villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus i trust you will not be displeased sir that valentine has not come with us or that i dismissed barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either   154.21914600283787
but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them   67.57053877552573
said fernand   107.90465591660195

beware of misadventure   116.27258780257853
free to do what   105.18384016249978
the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination   183.864646439919
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun   210.58453499163446
said morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator   142.40661142297128

you are the only man of whom i have heard her speak with interest   171.96017151233832
if i had missed you tonight i might not have had another chance   159.939540950113
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary   117.38239659258124
let them take my fortune i am already too rich   107.8703803539084
ah said morrel   162.1507361839959
anne s head was bent down she had not seen the italian s smile   206.45346546028492
and with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example   152.01604231293717
he has invited me to dine there   78.30571555876122
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance   126.91987862364348
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses   163.4883359276006

you are perhaps a tulip fancier   161.88717666285714
tis true i said so and i say it again   194.2541456550962
a sorrowful smile passed over his face   101.14127292685136
oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that valentine will be terribly revenged   58.37342602457396

if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle   7.2113137966549345

that s wise not for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the master for the masters we may say   184.4450242818936
this said monte cristo is less correct than your philosophy it is only faith   158.50832675388608

athos invited d artagnan to follow them   287.2731457872603

he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos   96.74549417806546

not my own wish mother but reason necessity   48.66826549402175
sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest   175.2329666828779
i was there at a fearful moment   111.42155554271201
finish then what you were about to say   204.56305274446973
now said the count what will you take a glass of sherry port or alicante   68.21797520027371
i forgot to ask you where are you taking me   90.67003537769915

i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms   45.42902129384824
d artagnan drew near the window and lent his ear   3.360429156844404
then you are called monsieur grimaud   126.78792756204274
d épinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations   184.11664338700774
well   218.6356660638995
in the antechamber he trembled   70.96514848121257
in two or three hours thought dantès the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm   79.22774654329957
you are a careful fellow edmond   118.16765913741526
oh i can not tell what she says to me   8.72150722251763
to morrow night we shall rescue you   209.3676232515502
i believe so   163.70191432708003
the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815   212.27056708120153
d artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone   100.29638600752688
sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth   138.6502915214698
i finish your phrase   137.23607912603154
and who is the assassin   71.37096824665007
he left there three men   106.31594874482134
but her cries were soon stifled   13.321821298776968
i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather   107.78269012908609
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo   9.84464141540127
let us talk a little said she   129.16780544034324
who told you that i loved him   140.33256773239697
debray who was present at the explanation   20.698335850011958
if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion   73.91333227787982
but give us your word that you will come too d artagnan said athos   187.36177365563032
and now tis your turn said the coadjutor turning to the last that remained   167.89799470317422
you have restored my courage by a single word   152.977317722592
and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal   154.18393449267884
and what did he do the rest of his time   35.66176660365319
doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions   133.1979874026792
the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery   115.78697710772876
i have looked at it with all possible attention said dantès and i only see a half burnt paper on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink   104.22358852452179
you look like four conspirators   95.39222675748572
listen my dear friend   75.09729285907385
if you like   83.78576935150576
how   80.93381957323083
he shall die   191.1220902977911
we do not give ourselves twice over said d artagnan   202.1973478406529
because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp   182.5653851307329
come come   77.12779386380005
it could no longer be doubted   135.93139130092874
m   152.6189176881964
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet   141.65459412647684
here we shall be alone and can talk   10.989057651049151
is there nothing more you wish   149.9949283275594
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fro of busy people   122.44624536477474
he was des roches le masle canon of notre dame who had formerly been valet of a bishop who introduced him to his eminence as a perfectly devout man   63.05157617641996
there was a postscript i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent   113.90814885109332
i will be an abbé if it suits me   61.496865687802014
she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price   173.57400460487847
augustine upon which we could not agree said the gascon   171.07816615755831
mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock   36.42760660006192
fortunately he is a cunning fellow that friend caderousse   155.9259912212133
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse   34.47708882230418
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets   104.7234483723816
and you albert   211.98935544650098
perhaps there is but one at this moment   90.5806271778211
they are two hotheads the one a gascon the other from picardy   77.52184456625115
i think it will be wise to set off said d artagnan   65.13032638268473
my son and a sacred command   62.36938792868364
asked the abbé   142.60713293339322
a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses   78.46727666743826
asked d artagnan   39.33544504832143
but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague reports   132.06101713116988
i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that   97.99239747995063
oh aramis   118.23376926664571
on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man   125.8304473475901
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended   142.50218806710265
here it is i see   97.36723520478152
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience   47.770615352108734
but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment   111.9623224917395
he borrowed this from don quixote the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly remembered   124.93445316119114
twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow   102.20779944536746
exclaimed madame de villefort the punishment monsieur   17.094481490573855
de monte cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject   63.29951728578951
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself   115.63603936462161
this was as we have seen the term which athos applied to d artagnan in his more expansive moods   302.4722215224458
the boat was built for speed   91.17151693126837
ah danglars   137.5721831094869
m   92.52297752090482
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half scared to his master   178.04274970635885
i should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near here the isle de daume or the isle de tiboulen and then i should have been safe   202.71456229701468
our best born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain it   51.38871497188455
50227m what have you to offer to me my friend   146.7852237465181
do you know who is captain of this vessel   0.9847001575454897
i shall go and die by his side   52.770731973240586
it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project   112.69069194071024
it is more important than you think perhaps   138.97492490845815
gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by lord de winter   163.4882590441926
the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin   86.62342345601797
org   142.37218835769465
scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled   116.12912205842716
well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it   18.906247104130003
for three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice   17.91910376967421
there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force   99.01794511440677
the air they breathed was heavy damp and cold   85.96255099094083
only that   105.73704255263647
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands   126.35259635544423
stop a bit   126.10561324438471
he then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits for the abbé adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guinea pigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit   81.57650529941962
and yet they refused to buy it   250.89678694942674
what have i to fear replied d artagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties   164.06426188584277
and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it   204.66251141414088
the husband had presided at the abduction of his wife   23.2074674827834
i was about to offer myself sir said the priest   126.35107340631599
but what is there to investigate sir   72.7448953398586
d artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was silent   42.680826144218
cried his foe   150.65785237927759
then it was so murmured winter and the next day henry iv   180.82982784149624
yes my lord   77.93226623947537
i suspected where she was concealed   86.63199913284089
buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and avenge himself for that little treachery   243.06144631478998
as regards yourself the need of protection   97.17231351666219
ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit   94.79330715198881
40064m albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea   53.007878132293726
you only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son   254.68868298555157
d artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter   81.30940317624874
ah ah   156.1088497976798
he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count s orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house   115.88404221180336
he had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry   171.46844342169945
ah   280.251074461482
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep   33.647476756166625
do you then suspect anyone   201.00244561203857
he went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him   22.711527306224866
the truth my dear count   79.71792104148645
asked this person   189.2789550745274
the english do they dislike wine   95.37061075413966
adieu valentine adieu   93.74200747466868
he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful   105.83551248678141
asked julie   178.55288463687808
it is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me   70.58530574608248
and so in spite of m   81.55657814945552
inquired the king   175.96411069782226
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu   96.34120757779989
one moment i beg for here are the chevalier d herblay and the comte de la fere just arrived from london and they can give you as eye witnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal sister   35.664791414687684
i know nothing   153.71359943227364
but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers   104.67731307682489
company of tréville   34.13060655269153
it was no longer a rival who was beloved   149.47788696267173
oh my god   61.03313659995794
the spade perhaps   83.29894747757868
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess   119.69789396273215
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty   145.23624885174115
your prayer is so much the more generous from your being i swear to you in the power of a man who will never pardon you   103.62292708216816
and who has said a word about killing him muddlehead   71.38708072955173
sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor   140.8298160966698
the cardinal folded and sealed his letter   39.122122557768876
lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets   77.53102484605381
in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day   128.0066270818197
it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before you   129.94084290268626
your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events   106.46148201390476
see there now   148.52380912632165

cried villefort then i was not deceived   249.90565991391955
asked he smiling   209.84035401292124
with that word great things are done   57.220661919327505
come come cheer up my dear father   62.31028698099575
sometimes he weeps bitterly sometimes laughs boisterously at other time he passes hours on the seashore flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes duck and drake five or six times he appears as delighted as if he had gained another marengo or austerlitz   141.39459481375957
a problem my dear count for everyone for my mother as well as others   117.23316438641777
a carriage was in waiting   267.2959563115372
it is with valets as with wives they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain   91.79815351185292

at all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some one at once to write to me   82.50958917794266
and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre   100.29917844217007
asked the young man withholding his arm   225.60326176900827
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies   177.29035123177303
then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring   39.06294237427238
i have not the uniform but i have the spirit   121.75657026341197
asked the prince   128.86895679400365
the general s carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went   7.46400473394263
soon he saw the lights of la consigne   95.92793878768404
they sent him a magnificent supper and took his million   101.832745897576
tell me their names   67.97486484773529
said the swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the german language had acquired a habit of swearing in french   190.51773504289426
it was hardly a quarter past six   152.03432251021172
i yesterday engaged a servant who had just left m   156.16702473631972
my friend urban grandier wasn t a sorcerer he was a learned man   1.8510102146636171
so that he related to me how in the plains of the pampas the natives hunt the tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety   42.501601508741544
what a life i cause you to lead poor maximilian you who are formed for happiness   180.41541893161974
come said the captain we have done all in our power and m   22.67252884654401
to own the truth i should be inconsolable if you were to leave vincennes   56.06198798717349
the abbé threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face   112.26982996792965
peter s   221.88053183571446
be sure of that   121.37609520632489
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the english   64.45199869082404
danglars your banker   48.925980435315026
it was planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that d artagnan himself could hardly recognize him   127.29566996569154
i believed that madame loved him   157.77636765207845
we did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully   190.70834782814092
aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion   168.94290117076093
halloo   202.51830725606237
and how did it happen   165.94197958524805
the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket   67.80157940572707
said d artagnan the expression is strong   129.4627303104446
sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause   124.39049480582891
and what have you done to aspire to this honor   154.18680521497618
think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said come despatch the dying   44.126438380634085
the count laughed   140.1901419401788
tis true that mercédès is not actually my wife   72.95487970312666
villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied   7.345830391507619
this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable odor   198.83819313037193
and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge   130.40591031758936
neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance   19.52935622109686
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor   97.48347335059876
he must now get his bearings   113.16368544998475
his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him   101.95915581623899
ah ah   152.6078578505396
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it   183.47795205564978
every man that s born must fulfil his destiny   56.60625753769834
we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some orders i have given have been executed   56.950507022536556
so   209.88272171135498
oh monsieur procurator s wife or duchess if she will but loosen her pursestrings it will be all the same   144.64941219924535
i do said my father   97.29552360536425
then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man   123.78026714264757
because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc   218.61243384982373
and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it   5.7818341403545475
and what message shall i convey to the baroness   168.75231731541874
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect   109.91271513832243
you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars   132.33903144533429
come raoul he said let us follow this man   208.41202793497152
faith said aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough let us revile the living a little   203.51490971605756
that is sufficient my lord   64.33750105383717
sir cried parry may you and yours be blessed   147.26810193738723
then he saw through the whole thing   182.96097166431392
order whatever you like for supper the only thing i specify is one of those pies   190.51355821576334
besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth   139.88209296342933
dantès raised his head and saw faria s eyes injected with blood   33.08416312209921
the caves of the small island of monte cristo all i poss   144.6841268273036
well   274.8995128117126
by the countess s visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone   70.14468526112017
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man s road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st   119.94481332977884
athos   65.19488215286508
eight   215.7108024270242
she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest   119.82366386674961
there were large bottles filled with serpents ticketed according to their species   129.7657961750817
have you finished   153.65253083997098
it is too long a time   68.44606827746412
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied   106.63155846155358
i am well i want nothing   54.62843393653141
i have already often told you of this   149.35733918052344
monte cristo bowed without making any answer   180.52241681007456
what do you mean   196.88807529246787
she had scarcely closed the door after her when monte cristo appeared at the corner of a street so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant   241.71048342486648
de monte cristo have you not   106.4620601546831
still he had patience for another half hour which appeared to him like a century   11.416904398669928
he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party   192.08439028062116
however promise me one thing   242.3386209852162
10 elisabeth de rossan marquise de ganges was one of the famous women of the court of louis xiv   224.03800581950546
but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the convent des carmes   150.83177223836913
but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence   163.1655737451604
they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor   28.060962806596677
baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address   45.44667348203116
before i leave you mercédès have you no request to make   21.41151312107732
into my room first replied comminges   245.83506709165934
he had seen château renaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised   7.002206833630396
his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face   64.60466874750063
yes and france is about to pay for her king s refusal with a war   54.90190581463069
a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you   94.95762202878758
pooh   183.69016325464034
at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard   212.72868648736116
come haydée come   152.1548380727213
except that which i ask of you dear love   107.6951014731758
have you brought it   97.79095251461467
i implored heaven that he might come   192.58471304036436
there it is my lord said the young man   236.02509533187862
but where is such a lackey to be found   171.14517757984717
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence   163.8233075745346
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes   147.356808462431
he perceived château renaud and debray who had just gained the good graces of a sergeant at arms and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before instead of behind him as they ought to have done   157.24993135946306
continued aramis   90.38028390149984
lost beyond redemption   8.558204993509733
all have forgiven me some have even loved me   124.01449279888249
i can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried and even condemned   183.0457065324964
lord de winter is only her brother in law   106.70485665622564
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father   71.16988115722546
he has i believe two hundred thousand francs in morrel s hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself   36.00501798495071
but the ink said dantès   71.44724221188831
i could not defer my pleasure so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealer s   187.8455002277344
i have a miraculous balsam for wounds a balsam given to me by my mother and of which i have made a trial upon myself   82.63939587749304
has it not been agreed that i should take you with me and did i not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure   99.48007607322
50197m and then he moved farther on and began again to dig   122.9524798233296
i am on the earth to punish madame he added with a flaming glance   207.3786896812648
and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you   98.46740301692023
every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows   125.12166218320202
besides they were followed by the curious who hearing of the wager were anxious to know how they would come out of it   113.43964316028129
noirtier s eye still retained its inanimate expression   130.71223408886212
coquenard had met porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his handsome spanish genet she would not have regretted the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband   173.99548159248465
have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas   121.6800608243251
he no longer doubted that the daughter of king charles i   112.37914568715942
the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming   152.19485332068365
fire   151.68924435134792
you insist   87.66247507334485
our partnership began in the month of april   24.84011568098566
woman woman why do you have such ideas   154.23237108721565
nevertheless when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths   175.6861632082142
in fact we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneasiness   168.33673176915852
interrupted mme   105.179189670599
now i belong to this last named class   28.573704198438804
no i will go and speak to him myself   116.93039186846617
i can not believe it murmured the banker   0.20610690357865735
you must return to the rue des fossoyeurs   84.76997703141518
after a long talk with the harbor master captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind   14.749324069184254
so to night mordaunt go to greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca lightning   91.28771644498224
not in the least   134.66643962076816
but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage   58.78608405594496
not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass   144.68688597554052
it really seems to me very curious   167.08875208830295
asked the coadjutor   138.13505287892175
the tutor followed them   79.50563015380804
saddle our horses take your carbine   89.81261702578028
replied noirtier fixing a majestic look on the young man   124.47169960196231
the door was closed and the carriage proceeded   182.7650871204183
then he added with a certain uneasiness did you meet them   29.761644563369515
said d artagnan at last   67.72186034658002
and must i lose the one to save the other   36.23045726706815
he asked of groslow   87.1988352324595
oho   87.24162976669376
he was not long in making his toilet   193.31768789692597
each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea   190.59670851081847
the same evening the cardinal spoke to m   198.13538353084851
are you alone athos   94.19893450334311
franz cried albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now   202.18344349514362
onward   77.13141674432651
he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice   128.24930357302824
inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place royale   70.00730786128318
asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver   90.78863889408701
d artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy   241.5990230166605
he s not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms   67.08221640224559
the maxillary muscles enormously developed an infallible sign by which a gascon may always be detected even without his cap and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather   70.73490972833788
for i have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild   17.707691915959003
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued   64.78101450944516
but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or looking indeed as if he had never seen them before   63.50548588226772
and planchet with aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by d artagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream   146.01811798189092
by leaving this light on the right he kept the island of tiboulen a little on the left   1.6279882466635058
why the devil have they any stairs with such windows   120.31468877384398
but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers   79.3431321110505
there   144.12568416133072
cried she   159.8045498094345
40138m you must wait for what   97.07947593484964
do you wish anything   49.33221650136066
meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form   31.852373908922374
he rose however as they approached   135.14305975778146
chapter lviii   127.42241009127919
besides bazin is ambitious and learned   142.03197153292197
for the first time in his life danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire   112.56120392565074
a garden with two acres of land   136.2299801505114
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine   123.38156707611537
the next day the prisoner s room was full of pictures and mottoes   25.219357679294163
yes   143.47978707205942
ah said he dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness do not talk of such things and suffer love pains   99.83836011867723
in a few hours they were in the capital   221.13151603109822
0285m evening came and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck   189.5855166325328
on   87.571051528733
three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him   79.18708737922131
but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him   56.87954118591907
they have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the palais royal   172.95078203342138
he hastened to the side door with ali entered hurriedly and by the servants staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant   85.36477429712596
the bandits shouted with laughter   187.51076499560088
that door is guarded d artagnan   129.23445216242519
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal   27.70191524847334
still persisted franz i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person   162.73050789574833
ah my dear fellow said albert rising and lighting his third cigar really i thought you had more courage   100.41246531653569

as long as they are in prison all will be well said anne but one of these days they will get out   191.71494415767532
although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair i will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you   105.13003783517928
you are right said milady   24.249890361589806

athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door   82.29034746105592
oh thank you a thousand times   142.74738799268917
he began to think he had to do with madmen   153.31294977146325
is he still as stingy as ever   73.03440996844037
and which i discovered in the pocket book of the messenger   99.07348681601503
what monsieur   80.75198132281542
he could not foresee the consequences   44.57940858435737
thanks father thanks   19.00022920284664

as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty   54.050456839110836

you are still at the hôtel des princes   27.18439472983235
the steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each other s torches   187.5830505874043
bertuccio said he   53.949932585144076
see him there cold as marble and proud like his father   165.4528435677014
it was then that d artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it   28.230864046330368
exactly so cried aramis   125.95732155110078
louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword which stood against a chair in a corner of the room   122.58592746211188
and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb   53.866397842996236
you ought to know   106.46451236086261
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage   99.85705833835557
do you then love mercédès   168.97010220861722
all this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so good natured who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year   118.05856301626362
at this announcement during which the door remained open everyone became mute and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel   89.02023784308668

nothing more than natural   79.43441290057281
then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet   133.40101559724508

monsieur du tremblay received d artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake   168.86978073342107
oh he doesn t stand well with his eminence   163.0613182664536

dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manœuvre was completed and then he added half mast the colors and square the yards   85.64284448645532
the young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his lips   169.4255739123676
but if he should be at home and see me   61.39899130151704

madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion   272.1726796498273
said d artagnan with great pleasure   164.2961896968313

as for aramis of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the character a character which like that of his companions we shall be able to follow in its development his lackey was called bazin   147.2254389842353

his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table   78.17065689276626
the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self love and defeated ambition   60.872606197479534

but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible   132.82035063116453

i have answered you a hundred times fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me again   172.0616748262497
no replied the count carelessly   61.52429424297869
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d artagnan all for one one for all   124.4298390149666
at the same time mercédès reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore   98.40667073151342
he sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect   20.036868550410347

your eminence will judge the ball of madame the constable   36.88509398564986

and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed he was able to provide for the wants of all for a fortnight   151.6386429478157
they resolved to profit by the count s courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained   153.43243896566133
but you are not one of us said porthos   106.72157907331085

but i warn you i shall defend myself even against you   74.17122991059816
resumed d artagnan not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead   97.3771215575347
she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object   205.58679997000002
you will come with me then maximilian   74.47047388259355

the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice   79.39732173333178
i will say and do nothing until i am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever   99.30755958192782

noirtier s eye was fixed on the dictionary   169.36577196017112
they shook their heads   102.91424163994812
it was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking   113.99782897554263
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so   68.11904399010444
mousqueton recognizing the voice of his master s friend got up suddenly and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night   214.6558941658809

for my part i confess to you that i was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the mazarins in the world   117.8398041833486
a sort of smile played on his lips   151.69632339386126

no one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers   4.6401116159509
cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave   161.02856543995546
as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars   143.4379426228827
when he had concluded his speech beauchamp bowed coldly to albert turned his back upon him and went to the press room   199.00798361373654
and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody   128.7296110767032
and to you a good journey   202.14174871055366
mazarin started   150.56519755957527
at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started up   111.35165599503733
and you do you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois   195.1596966164319
asked rochefort   141.45451616404344
the groom cried aloud for help   34.813199327532175
i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly   141.28086136433458
man of ability as he was louis xviii   82.79156248519185

at this moment the clock struck six   202.70949069593854
at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright   183.92611291509095
or rather tell him nothing   173.81001089064046
i swear before god who seeth us and who in the darkness of this night heareth us never shall my sword cross yours never my eye express a glance of anger nor my heart a throb of hatred at you   131.68889181522533
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way   24.792410961658263
he is saved   54.9495902798346
if you arrive safely at home what have i to fear except from you   121.74137668685427
is this your counsel also winter   76.32566028164825
i know it madame replied the count   144.89484104358604
very well   47.847525670803776
this garden has never been a cemetery   61.00724365396225

after some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention   63.160270314995294
in the course of his morning s walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted him   86.75165915320818
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone   40.238944095702834
this frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes that she could not doubt their influence even over monsieur de condé   104.8760759191934
bonacieux   140.62016763514094
and his guardian what would he have said to that   75.75089132288923
sit down in mercy   86.83169310724502
but a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with cardinal richelieu is no longer the same man   114.87878747205065
well what then   102.04478702908564

it is so hot at marseilles that really i believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever   134.98313880947973
de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on parade he stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday evening do you know gentlemen   87.90184770277054

there they are   146.58033819181873

bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer   45.67447285311334
i inevitably look for better times   127.34123739266582
i wish my lord would make me one promise   139.13451162207014
i am already upon the scent resumed d artagnan   190.3764341909642
20181m this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the count s box   168.44124471492125
but first write your request to dessessart   7.302010434177035
porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage but with the eye of a jealous woman mme   116.28482244967103
neither had his eyes bandaged   123.12495358425954

your dinner has been a real feast   133.35154748945436
and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour   127.08405440621746
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertaker s men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial   74.66350395851315
i am parched with thirst   193.5305799086533
and then   147.96734664613845
danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wife s this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france   62.516483483879625
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it   85.12100474390004
well go down to her then to make your request   132.56667109213194
would you like to become rich or at least independent   50.508866500755175
i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son hasn t his mother s energy   150.08438270490615
40231m because you had been arrested edmond and were a prisoner   89.1450094147734
do think of it giulio   98.80769544002865
50253m peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the fowl   86.34618552890296
preceded by ali who carried a rose colored flambeau in his hand the young lady who was no other than the lovely greek who had been monte cristo s companion in italy was conducted to her apartments while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself   96.15192448432742
but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody s professions of friendship   90.87928274326751
and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends   46.07757835302337
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us   201.71877932914117
oh woe to me   152.49621625452824
what could put such an idea into your head   95.96918125646322
perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m   64.3394136123338

meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi   82.2859667457927
this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor   99.72473571001677
so much the better duke so much the better said the king advancing toward the door   84.01472185020683
as soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river   170.81607958583294
you here rochefort   134.52057067617852
then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor what my brother is it you   99.09679866865943
be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear to me from the moment i am not obliged to see an enemy in you   221.2366641083182
but not finding it he summoned his resolution and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the queen had acknowledged the paper was to be found   160.98855634848076
then porthos and aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to grimaud   152.1585710027058

chat between brother and sister during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door close a shutter and draw a chair near to his sister in law s fauteuil milady anxiously thoughtful plunged her glance into the depths of possibility and discovered all the plan of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen   133.48166235471902

the baroness approached leaning on madame de villefort s arm   119.8892451958495
and the king laughed facetiously   105.57583950700945
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos   55.71116415005399
tis well said porthos we shall remember that   132.3677251235175
it will be a nice little throat cutting   27.5491244191833
cried dantès   101.19702029048423
before doing so i must consult the trial justice   72.17407972637632
for as soon as i leave this place i will tell everything   116.39956198589539
on the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the london stamp which only contained these lines i have them   153.9948747163666
and do you comprehend grimaud   26.25956644571525
what is it   61.04350079481739
screamed she turning towards the wall as if she would tear an opening with her hands   150.68500422860097
monsieur d arminges said de guiche remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible   83.41158635508236

london   109.97185700316305
i have corrected the vices that i had   131.38478197504014
cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him   126.61261338000348
he came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the details   136.29731220663018

de monte cristo has only shown us kindness   143.50036422441704
and i too added aramis   71.47239425336136
the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreigner well he would be more justly estimated   114.80257615785116
for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed again and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself   121.61554974093636

at these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token   102.68809911962536

there was a secret communication between the cardinal s apartments and those of the queen   269.12475948426004

bertuccio you are going to stay in the carriage then   170.09915773789228
adieu my kind friends   119.84368213818199
it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formed it was none of these things that attracted the attention it was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdain these were what fixed the attention of all upon him   188.44018774349234

if not in the name of god at least in your own name   69.90153843252861
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d artagnan   76.08907018773385
and madame de villefort   100.35291076256478
if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said morrel i would invite the count to our house   82.33529947524279
aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that d artagnan and porthos might enter   65.80310482876907
he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point   147.854331997428
what is it   73.21614282836651
more intrigues   198.18734444228528

he is very gracious thought the queen   123.12534778018532
he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues   33.47425657987321
and why have you such an air of sadness aboard   24.139969953702177
where   89.99906178640302

the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair   44.935225453275336
if when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the sea   183.16221438687305

he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future   123.93498855137588
but exclaimed the young girl why am i thus pursued   175.60861869984052

de villefort left the room and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother   55.98355094887929
encouraged by this invitation d artagnan followed the duke who closed the door after them   137.9004009204884
what consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase d artagnan has done me one good turn he has destroyed broussel   122.99448060992859
oh work work my passion my joy my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows   86.0904960983666

i thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated   103.42142156257566
you followed him   69.6130179174148
not before i have killed you poltroon   152.8951112785537
this voice was that of my father   219.96236239279858
then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the traveler s abandoning his purse to save his life   167.5985277273477
added d artagnan timidly   177.7198068936595
which you are taking back to him   190.1657457020195
you want a pretext do you not   161.2691932217136
that was d artagnan s road as he was going to the louvre   150.8848601906489
inquired the abbé with a laugh   38.50688745031107

monsieur bonacieux said the commissary looking at the accused as if his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts you have a wife   146.96375804108285
you know it is you alone whom i love   76.74367934081354
now my dear guitant i have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable memory   138.61348962760007
madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais   51.25510204982922
she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repeated it maximilian   76.65517493983685
my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but misfortune   23.733184764671037
maximilian said she maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven i entreat you do as i do live in suffering   48.66974912400583

pierced hearts   62.06068703312364
what sort of person is this count of monte cristo   173.8476271324111
at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m   71.30733917303913
she wouldn t believe me saying that she knew anne of austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb   216.6809159681298
what do you think of this   24.435320333054023
you think   203.32548947224166
eh it was that that did the business   186.37641286857837
the cardinal s hair stood on end   104.38350273391835
here it is my lord   125.64677607381421
she read it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone   199.67426075054223
if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way   82.32475233877601
perhaps   21.914317545686302
but how about our prisoners   8.354033632357954
two other clocks slower than that of saint philippe du roule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent   115.70232450427815
she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources   88.8055318459812
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly   94.98935992466677
and as i am a gentleman i keep my word   166.82718446441578
but he did not return the paper to d artagnan   152.7142261044593
thank you sir said d avrigny   78.20825069514675
that you know is my daily promenade   100.43241907035782
i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information   42.53685285961872
well said the baroness do you leave m   93.65296147799776
we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes and we shall have complete success   21.32872183448967
do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison   3.2247221381003612
they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in   158.65091649855282
and what do you mean to do   173.32753834082138
mercédès raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her   119.32946384703918
i took them home with me with the permission of the guardian and devoured them   43.69333030679671
but of what sort   114.02512237372831
whither does your excellency desire to be driven   141.0731075048077
yes we will wait   124.71663199580641
blaisois found bazin donning his beadle s gown his services being required that day at notre dame   80.88376765516603
said mazarin astonished   26.859781608721647
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction   149.99711530330882
it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse   159.2673109144618
he was a man of twenty five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining   28.36023878924759
and the four friends quit the room leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont   105.82955938488514
the king opened it and found in it two diamond studs   144.18680991550153
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so   63.09557071039564
and what does it concern then my captivity   112.34317662848675
a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been disciplined   28.68967474609856
there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity   162.67023835233533
ah   43.9563628492578
andrea visibly changed countenance   104.42265716583587
the history of haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave   162.21141345284008
ill very ill say you   146.47933263006925
ah his name   144.6795958148037
it is the first time he has ever been in paris   26.126026617877983
yes sir i certainly committed that imprudence   47.18527411666537
i have eaten nothing   76.65444550343614
what says the abbé   153.80405084992339
but then young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty one who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation   202.83809825162172
and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed   261.76711138057885
that s because you haven t served said mousqueton   11.071832103675064
come come cried d artagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment   59.86464288546526
contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his incognito was strictly respected   175.19006156000844
your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which i am deputed to see you   163.44295074048088
he muttered   143.0828160359633
surely answered danglars one can not be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air   172.05405858426394
there wasn t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor duc d enghien   234.7367784740264
sdeath   180.08251641821278
hush   276.2025715299156
more than ever   93.35610981718779
but as the cabin was his last resource he knocked again   161.97927478011817
she had a son observed athos   218.29080558406352
willingly said aramis   0.6222436938745943
but why is my grandfather allowed to live   137.23840434871204
said athos turning on d artagnan a searching look   99.38693160779508
as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure   140.9144062715218
