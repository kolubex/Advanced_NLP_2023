however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian life a life of politeness visiting and introductions   50.994279455520925
i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife   66.07295864725242
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation   178.14158219337077
i knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet i her father forgive you for i see that your grief is real and deep   68.98402533258823
do not speak to me of that said monte cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed   171.50261288421822
i told you we were informed beforehand   145.77672179909297
the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out good bye mercédès we shall soon meet again   48.87763217373221
but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman   104.02982516830455
sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary   105.23178257204896
he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there   142.9130485474695
franz d épinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife   229.55938659944667
for i saw god s justice placed in the hands of benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence   183.37343297836406
you can dispute together and that will pass away the time   113.25162519473982
they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks   124.75593021117187
he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel   112.91608931679566
and what are they   91.54966528005723
at what time you please sir replied franz   164.17227913828654
and the young man   65.90350035390892
de monte cristo at the opera yesterday he apologized on the ground today   17.967281732526075
edmond found some solace in these ideas   186.72647074463484
and he set his mind actively to work   111.53690021398471
murmured milady between her teeth   90.51137097678384
at the corner of the street they met the count s steward who was awaiting his master   97.97710669212944
last evening   188.01208743060036
in these caves   126.39806931843131
morrel fell back in his chair his strength was failing him   217.66737940662375
villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity   43.70370598889319
there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation   159.83562613315488
have we overtaken them   56.96641844456536
but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead   122.38562386291314
i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minute s delay   160.4398475810381
he has i repeat the longest head of the four and for my part i declare that i will obey him   107.72093138875114
michael   144.12232626823243
mousqueton shrieked with pain   41.358373664631216
d artagnan my dear m   104.87020260174404
and yours   181.38312227624152
and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands   87.3378578072298
but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post   112.4276103032419
five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits   185.47558529845026
good day sirs said the duke advancing   91.43785597117562
some of the men moved toward them   190.81327675495868
porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through   179.6333773960097
benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin   155.10320464463206
did he not make a million in spaniards this last year   119.40085596058465
madame said the president may reference be made to the count of monte cristo who is now i believe in paris   126.57164445067077
i do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man   9.964056108605647
messrs   68.15983584550489
i answered in greece   119.89825123741778
but of what then does the equipment of your company consist monsieur porthos   124.48986633667245
i shall expect you then in half an hour baron and valentine will be ready   48.38599425478073
his guards taking him by the arms and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind   104.07439443776472
the night chapter 90   114.35258404577117
albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole but he kept the faded one in his hand   80.73233295672108
he began as you begin   245.41125966115104
at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d avrigny and morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in grief   119.98984707236181
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out   35.38435397191182
an angel alone could have saved one of us from death that angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each other   159.37656319816216
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino   75.89362405503522
my god grant that he may one day suffer what i suffer   45.857911829491144
the king has no authority here   127.67265660134335
d artagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense   183.86436043163366
read   140.59076539323934
yes i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort   154.7290541036482
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight o clock had been watching his door   43.12467188992112
guided by valentine he had learned how to understand the old man quickly   191.2548628372893
this was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rose colored glass   288.04272625145506
said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this   116.64486424545976
well what do you wish me to do for you   73.27989533347916
returned monte cristo that is a prejudice on your part m   70.33996840328078
this separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded   111.17791791634858
said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would   112.63956544127146
i have heard porthos speak of her that s all   105.63850016344051
the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti   148.75151863104315
monsieur boisrenard   175.43904073433487
you do not understand me gentlemen said d artagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun   172.75835296340193
30323m what are you drinking dear grandmamma   83.3845483551988
it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness   76.1422856489954
the ground is soaking wet   122.89769656852329
d artagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbé d herblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend   128.07016413092933
and he looked smilingly at aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise   72.42109926468896
and then having no subject left for contemplation he shut his eyes and fell asleep   135.8993576027973
no no no no no she is not there replied edward singing his words   133.5003050671603
he had formed his resolution   105.00230534062516
unless i die i shall always be what i am and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard even from the mouths of kings for kings have need and other persons have fear of you   177.3604765128947
athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing   146.12434353438763
the major recovered his self possession   54.13789189988069
yes continued morrel death had entered that house twice within one month   153.88656789537362
d artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army   166.74702394893228
and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came   109.23750452019053
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner   46.92791872401877
did not the messenger say your father s safety depended upon it   100.18949736203554
was i a major   83.93411219077602
you are then going to a hotel that will be very dull for you   28.937333482622833
whispered mme   177.87223725065792
and monte cristo with an expression of majesty and sublimity advanced with arms folded toward the young man who involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man recoiled a step   126.6967905723958
the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually   131.0448042312489
said caderousse crossing himself   63.09787611477501
in that quality i say what i please and at this moment it pleases me to say that you weary me   100.68068206578303
anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride   123.33563425652727
and nothing more   126.96309785378078
and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into france to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money   148.11368590638273
tis not his voice   40.26832017714402
the council of the musketeers chapter xlviii   104.93412107655568
and tell the confectioner that i will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his pies not only now but when i leave my prison   80.45763784662091
the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and d artagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m   212.37595801215542
as usual   141.08945340733248
you are mistaken planchet replied d artagnan   149.06534661148552
you know i am waiting said monte cristo smiling   172.83852934985498
but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard   170.72397100772338
do not disturb yourself on my account i beseech you   104.01933652364332
and added he with a smile she will take her own   117.68395883182214
i hoped your house would have been some other one than this   105.94197605469272
do me that honor my queen and i will find a messenger   93.97548919788056
oh yes yes i thank you with all my heart said valentine   76.17886634880387
demanded villefort   80.69048215407388
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m   233.27551802677476
i forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen   87.24130294619364
said albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow   166.5066293963427
crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dust the people as the advocate general talon described it had nothing left to them except their souls   20.222317612641888
well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boy slayer   6.9007173690898895
the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dantès mind   61.92423017229617
however he remained standing clinging to a window   93.18261371242374
i can not be mistaken   52.92425851040278
said danglars laughing   66.97677888772787
now as at the moment in which d artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance   130.38728584705015
and the king had reached in his jealousy of buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone else   29.29237715241719
mazarin who was sitting at a table folding up papers as if he had only been a secretary of state looked up   71.56641857019348
the steamer soon disappeared and in an hour afterwards as the count had said was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night   157.98624436699774
where is this dear aramis   114.58948653729672
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties i retained the sense of my danger   92.48821840731696
and charles i   94.03593530410225
ah that is just what i can not tell you   157.86572324711022
the two friends repaired to athos s and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them   111.16656958572614
my hôtel will be always open to you   101.4133037496828
it was with him she agreed and not with me   57.38143391010771
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today   134.28427110615047
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy   160.96832019044513
the coadjutor went to him and held out his hand   88.52042462656534
but all this will come to an end tréville will come to an end   93.76717014303513
the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count s house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered   82.05507024759866
like mère simon s son who has not chosen the worst strawberries   147.7139796139881
and you have returned have you not   133.80183194860444
but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant i have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name   58.23578987762832
and what is your choice   61.27899111207211
to all the simple things which escaped our gascon milady replied with a smile of kindness   60.32935832354574
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming   123.498592695643
the tenth of your income that would be fine work   150.83305792150446
who has   61.97920201510483
my friend monsieur du vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day   104.1523624920125
and what i have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord   75.31117189529691
seven o clock   45.479354717602575
is this your counsel also winter   165.04692228344402
i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head   100.83273529439322
but i cried morrel groaning with sorrow i love her   145.25424646878008
de servieux the king s chamberlain who is in high favor at court   127.39030576340444
still i was but an agent led on by an invisible and offended deity who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl   86.23901493606348
poor valentine   63.363779130449714
you are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal   71.91619020593527
athos turned pale   167.63483362166932
have you it   140.94719243385705
my child is there   108.13998315990992
and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where d artagnan was confined   204.50156407649192
she moved forward   135.89033585115726
speak make haste   82.99984061139457
it has been in the family a very long while returned monte cristo a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital   149.3832546861513
andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind   53.465397568100414
i am murdered   160.18394304064165
d artagnan arose   137.5711054430863
he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and baptistin entered   56.6379408359711
has monsieur bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife or for any other person   165.74540182533553
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep   53.0290549705854
the two prisoners a year after louis xviii   162.46469014887566
yes yes resumed de guiche   184.15738363679185
she knelt upon a cushion and prayed with her head buried between her palpitating arms   52.87041727807194
she is beautiful   30.339171856129028
madame de villefort is dressed   146.19892814723528
consider monsieur the thing is absolutely impossible   94.58557740244919
there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the king s attorney and that s all settled   167.6773986570933
the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder   69.97341355525342
there are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured morrel cocles and julie   126.22340556784549
stay i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this   115.44059578274161
i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st   146.29236642745877
and i advise you not to take 25 000 francs for the profits of the voyage   102.9287780077114
you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions   119.41482345267868
monsieur said the cardinal are you a d artagnan from béarn   185.18646625122165
and now said athos while they bring the wine tell me d artagnan what has become of the others come   208.5123836322228
but i like mine as well   124.65074513118051
the prince de marsillac my old friend will recommend our young friend to madame de longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately   93.31818159409775
you will do as much as that will you   77.59147454169616
comminges who was on guard that night at the palais royal ran in   83.16658986918252
fernand s mind was made up   141.16632072004091
julie emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian   121.15665683181994
andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was   117.72593837198089
what a delicious abbé you would have made   111.6495298430434
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken   141.96610018903925
well then you wish to know if i am of mazarin s party   108.92716481985573
one of us went to him and invited him to the rue saint jacques where he would find some friends   144.99373590714492
felton said he   180.11541966358877
he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts   3.708081126440291
i promise you i will sustain my part to admiration   131.258011720841
when he saw the formidable and chosen body with which louis xiii   71.12793814539113
it was a strange thing and one which made d artagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful disorder   140.80891018551708
we are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bastion   88.79749173403155
he begged for another week which was granted to him   71.12833506851315
the attendant was at the door holding the cardinal s horse by the bridle   150.72506680625048
you are here in my apartment and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal   152.39175137981223
and although it is generally with her husband s money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him   70.1392874788349
basset   66.4121609098046
they directed their horses to the city   118.27976013432998
true i was a tailor till the trade fell off   150.41422600398988
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace   196.96247848582038
at the last large door in the street   138.74941629737532
about this time the nurse s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand   105.08191612057634
we might be off during the time   143.58738531559246
i rely on you valentine said morrel   23.149465911573046
as for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of paris who has the very greatest power at the court of rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences   117.4539785202852
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks   191.07141170048826
where is the treaty   120.30545799182185
found himself opposite his house in the champs élysées   136.6122794549271
then he is there   155.24120523206207
why everything is relative answered the abbé   160.95923168603184
oh sir she said   172.25614142558842
come hither i say and don t be afraid continued athos   145.4225041350948
we shall take the place of those two fellows   45.93731905208051
morrel all the forms were got over   85.6097413850713
she will repent and no one will know that she has been guilty   33.73340783900355
one can no more now reckon on one s friends than on one s footmen said porthos   53.56785779387004
i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy   147.63374972573132
god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away   119.43849727998415
is he pleased with you   105.39744985325584
very well to morrow sir   115.0881223167455
and now here are 32 500 francs payable shortly   27.354673844122985
i have its fellow he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and it cost me 3 000 francs   106.53119716318776
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter d artagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner   68.69396098292691
danglars opened his bewildered eyes   126.89012965446338
besides i know what travelling is   151.02562412456234
nothing absolutely nothing at present but quitting paris as i told you as soon as possible   135.32222682242926
you will soon know what to expect for here he is   109.85591560345628
the name of edmond s betrothed was mercédès   135.75282357748776
athos played and that as a rule unfortunately   101.0946219399597
the french way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the parisian   173.2206785128187
at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin who was running breathlessly   131.91286924884795
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de château renaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf   107.45068953487959
winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours   11.33367634525355
then d artagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting   131.4080552375732
no to the cardinal   100.20016002518123
and my father who you know is a strong minded man himself appeared deeply impressed   40.10311068139451
what love   106.8939096608901
i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime   93.37624408754097
what did he tell you   107.22519417249407
then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs   124.10239996882791
a genuine englishman your eminence   109.9986896791416
if those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle   69.1407637724173
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions   153.87558931605304
i have no enmity against m   109.427735407276
alas no monsieur replied the count   88.51038695371898
thou again   107.14305546297425
the enemy s army extended from cassel to courtray   81.98177127099672
climb up said he to dantès   57.64166057657836
she believes in dreams   106.56442766674456
then she is dead   152.83025063160255
that is my grand story of the fair lady and when i relate that i must be very drunk   112.90928090880766
but where are you going to eat my breakfast   158.1214737409556
and as the man approached d artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door   50.340877696467246
no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say   138.13498248721092
morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen   159.65890994650013
besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice   52.629127749790065
his firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start   39.28111710348162
alas yes murmured de winter   55.40715399036589
i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience   118.74318772076418
in the meantime follow debray s example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit   130.62191986075598
this amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience   79.65195644549857
d artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old fashioned taverns   179.6040555378775
monsieur olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said d artagnan sternly   89.25069216923148
what do you hope   175.17431287275753
i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself   103.99828867075396
they soon tired of the sport   91.74085443677426
here is one he said   160.32488714515642
oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine them   123.45667463151175
you know they are my witnesses   91.64728376634581
you know it is you alone whom i love   124.15337685554546
and the queen believes well what does the queen believe   100.61743948714653
in that case let us go said the shipmaster   108.68573043445545
he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight o clock in the evening   57.794985286159076
in fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank   130.56649312695842
cried raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back   164.37832542762254
he asked of franz   126.05341450408497
well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder   146.15281813339064
twenty five years old   195.04095877844327
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m   23.39367712676669
yes replied she trying to recover her self possession   151.27116162231846
be prudent   122.25461658247913
lions of roman crowns and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro   88.76857486519755
said d artagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country   100.08900431779693
monsieur returned maximilian raising the glass cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide us from ruin and our name from shame and disgrace a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot   136.0654502810035
20353m the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed   114.62026510622378
well monsieur he is still here   53.672386242623354
porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening   153.00963741611304
oh said morrel i know not indeed if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count morrel hesitated   132.5074452537462
an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race   119.96063157548055
you are too just and reasonable a man monsieur   61.679682961168155
said d artagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself   200.0360759913043
asked harrison of d artagnan   171.1444487043405
i see no objection to that   142.29842413079854
edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not thus   37.96424373455062
certainly it was not the cardinal   149.08867872733435
he has punished you   187.58914829752976
9 money and sanctity each in a moiety   100.72885022295057
and how dressed   114.56174172253405
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april 1625 the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller   145.25023964840358
he ought to aid you in your search   88.51982474173212
it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements   95.5608534782988
when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood   98.35133352481624
the count s features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity   145.63187570259367
i love you i   192.04439871876218
have you that means   86.67499736950353
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream   101.68262600266667
yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter and crossing his arms   126.94564568813094
valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather s answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few steps   134.4454153191746
he is no longer in my hands replied villefort   170.54752634230974
it was time for the jailer was coming   107.69290922600132
she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward athos   156.84468881938272
at ten o clock milady began to appear restless   106.12201765477133
and how do you make your twelve thousand francs   28.57082698706641
the citizens always took up arms readily against thieves wolves or scoundrels often against nobles or huguenots sometimes against the king but never against the cardinal or spain   107.24566328170094
misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect   142.87115087428933
and the cardinal s spies brought bad news from every direction which greatly agitated the minister but was calmly received by the queen   64.87477826838413
milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction   131.23031323122763
madame du vallon was of doubtful gentility   126.11471891606328
only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of st   145.15579780895797
i must confess to you count said danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me   101.9884442946356
planchet watched the flight of flies   76.5056090213188
do you understand master benedetto   15.70191872228311
said maximilian in consternation   201.00232339670737
if she had committed two crimes i would say here m   142.37230208895346
in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance   140.11504929987353
to your health   52.691162045578025
and he entered the little room in which edward slept   164.08142343372833
morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve   145.40365977613746
and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear   91.0612481942174
she was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback   152.00300625477968
at all events it is best that he should follow us to athos s   93.82495074049831
if he stays in we will break in the window   137.941719418567
when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day   3.9223522301223
and her mother madame de saint remy have they yet told her of it   79.16645402012286
i do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king   186.16001733148354
if you die i will die with you   176.42052723757376
and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary   83.7590081043059
as to you good sir you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on that head   82.65570378094537
come now do smile instead of looking at me so solemnly   98.56538237358424
there was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti   108.34384588210858
buckingham saw by the expression of the young man s face what was passing in his mind and he smiled   137.15348030141743
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there   98.44496998093506
danglars is to see mademoiselle eugénie settled   170.78398653308489
parry said the king rising too my horse   80.35933276028835
a thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it   160.08096270956568
maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word   127.09172042614735
he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding   81.58291797015322
and with all this how unassuming he is   123.29922963259783
a piece of bread was brought and jacopo offered him the gourd   60.52061198482421
he laid every action of his life before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us   35.2202896076938
when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon   122.63123755192002
an illustrious person awaits you   197.42014333965062
asked the count with deep emotion   125.55276733129583
she is already late   151.53522100294876
indeed said louise i admire you and i could almost say respect you   193.3895573940688
the horses were also refreshed   128.69726812278114
no one has brought a letter monsieur replied planchet   86.0697475824428
call for me at eight o clock or shall i wait supper for you at seven   148.07131347917357
milady s robe was not the less stained with blood in a second   190.1307186451103
porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos   103.22689751895939
and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portières   112.4296724795364
oh by that by that i was branded indeed   5.360006562104317
then he approached a little piece of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous visit   81.32072854305972
d artagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive   195.09461428746084
my friend said andrea i have been dining at saint jean aux bois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest   119.34603891976676
asked franz of the count   113.73880070891266
fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him   133.46017449957208
this jealous anger of milady was his revenge   155.4122152230687
ah this letter gives me an idea a capital idea   169.08263279305783
forty thousand cried la carconte   128.57209233132932
well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten   67.37155846121706
i hope to see monsieur de chatillon whom i ve hated for a long time there   106.29660475452769
by a tailor a coachmaker a brewer   53.046633713212394
said porthos placing a finger on his lips   108.35180794410611
he was shown in directly   148.07217624449623
i am cold i am hungry   162.99492036083458
ah monsieur said mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets   47.29985348301898
good evening maximilian   156.06863805276856
on one side was the vast wilderness of the saint lazare on the other paris enshrouded in darkness   159.36772472497876
oh i am sure of that   177.4036791407779
then i will go to the governor of algeria   182.98277942174164
but don t touch me   212.41444852440176
as for the other knife it would serve a double purpose and with it one could cut and thrust   49.63442575737109
monte cristo advanced a few steps which were heard on the gravel   167.97981503348097
but i can t be severe with him he is really so bright   119.23613741888515
but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied athos   160.08656949613328
a light appeared under the door   94.76958609579565
now they begin to look concerned   98.2484994004974
was that all he said   75.17538433182366
do you prefer i should seek m   142.1775881997604
i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake   78.24806092147662
he had heard so many utter the same things indeed he heard nothing else   146.80464869589952
no violence   102.20375929093154
but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles   169.6786944370484
oh that is very simple   72.22107354220387
then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room   18.495677448136817
he had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort   120.05735967434687
yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious   132.55902734515456
and you say that one of your friends lives in that house   147.24903256738824
anne of austria took one step backward became so pale that it might be said she was dying and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind her to keep herself from falling she with her right hand drew the paper from her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals   115.62197954410793
drums were beating in the streets and in the port   228.27321423290832
porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary man   59.14247977184345
only grazed a little replied d artagnan   145.38782663756737
that will do very well said aramis   89.93646230215812
henry said charles call me your father   130.3181063707067
and then his mind was made up when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug   51.92738242341048
here excellency said peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork   138.05540376808491
she will save us said conti   92.39174807641254
do you aramis order the servants   124.75666175808674
mercédès is dead madame said monte cristo   6.3402989015298346
but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs   55.164526708413085
at midnight   104.08372377516154
we can find out his   45.638889462583435
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch s blood fell down insensible   67.45587321619365
but there was none   53.069376546855786
yes that is true reverend sir   210.46083330143546
if he troubles me too much i will crush him the insect   196.37926295256395
you re in the wrong there   174.6849639972792
tis a long time since i saw thee   84.48473616751087
are you my friend   118.67510981341141
let us alight   142.4688815787548
this very night   70.32265050413906
now give me the cardinal up here   165.24223667590883
at the moment she entered the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the cardinal appeared he being dressed as a spanish cavalier   35.725553109782
my poor brother was ignorant of this sentence   151.73321054023103
it is more than we need   87.18873500029116
it was very boldly written if disguised   91.29397525448877
edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay   16.381538185924427

although athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress   100.15559189600391
is your name bonacieux   37.073158871347374
but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon   79.76983194961876
through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second   183.95060199266152
you held her hand you were feeling her pulse and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me   96.11865093402595
madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far   168.02969666865053
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith   220.51119616263384
i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it   64.32034998343609
well then said athos what are your schemes   105.54024538417275
de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawing room   73.47514210692336
however difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished him   172.85056309847488
a wax light placed on the mantle piece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony   35.44627407255308
she will not rest contented beaten   189.63205196297895
yes he checks his pace   160.84904127334664
only behind the guards the barricades were closed again   159.90036636255175
and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel   98.48821772768626
i have the true idea   148.60014970723404
one thing alone frightened her   103.5061738163262
we have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room   159.10201612739849
when the shot was fired   204.10190224600993
suddenly the daylight began to fade away   149.6653244414187
d avrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocked down madame de villefort in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen   79.5234079141241
and no steel traps   87.52984510582925
but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity   153.3707316368519
gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate   136.31722568760563
certainly but you make me out better than i am dear count   192.013771813703
but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments   79.87297607544534
have you anything to do with it   135.36399750015684
he has told you rightly   139.61145679875986

emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf danglars and villefort   95.10996298557728

thou hast become a horse stealer   129.91578784171713
ruined   28.17263688342767
faith it is franz and debray   141.68087446542916
valentine went to the door and called barrois   111.70772034796933
oh grace grace pardon   100.31262240828468
oh the good father the brave father the very honest father   34.17560280349166
it is really wonderful said the count   110.98476742630362
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures   19.88065513012674
the french ladies madame   54.627145249465165
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england   126.59719660134535
then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died   140.28176181311753
monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips   178.50846185467398
the king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer   51.31482662496275
three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden   55.43792976785607
the innkeeper shivered   53.07402520180355
my english horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth   97.64921176386459
carried off   66.50922433892227
yes said porthos but there are the equipments   150.58501568592516
but that does not affect the son   148.3935131540661
i ask for it   164.96750115208246
there is the half pistole   93.9611993660288
and the prince was pleased with you   107.50469042997398
it rests between his conscience and his god   76.57797453538006
someone has vexed you   47.517762191270606
a man bringing a letter from oliver cromwell   112.3954642804749
said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven   135.33160638133157
coquenard was served first then porthos   129.03457641950186
nor i nor i chorused the sailors   86.57026465025336
cried he and why does he come   103.77061844829136
and bazin   132.7632566574912
then just as i am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me   167.28751441847862
but but what   167.66036923463395
i don t want anybody else to talk to me   124.62036490739371
you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you of am in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and i unable to do anything in the world for her   109.45842493685478
confiteor   162.97138578527
on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first   194.87324236199925
ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile   101.82341213344782
your feet too said grimaud   10.403092855578691
my weapons   141.11316365942446
a keeper   129.9423270926427
let us go on   79.58079045949576
tréville had grasped the weak side of his master   145.9324842251925
every one nowadays wants auxiliaries   114.24794177287035
monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly   106.36416342836769
and he rendered very important services to your father   127.67199519586421
but you need not fear   143.60272179991196
then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated   185.47446742587107
but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act   105.03602162215239
have you something to tell me   56.92930929936035
so they tell me monseigneur   173.30753290031728
at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning   160.3877656174191
this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion   149.41989681284088
well dantès you do not thank me   89.84298948675145
but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast   152.61035339772516
i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces   109.42883752600433
de villefort received the following note the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment   51.44456760210625
as for you although we doctors can not divest our patients of nerves i fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field   121.24352696247833
wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting up   101.0169741241786
meanwhile come along with us   107.49342459191769
when do you mean to set out   25.274459924504328
by turning to the left therefore he would find it   123.86119658553649
i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina fatigued with long service here haydée cast a significant glance at monte cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative   139.03197305229298
the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty five years of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes   124.84495645282153
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her   127.90785851076127
de liancourt by m   122.18185287160154
you have seduced this young girl   169.6831680599978
then turning round he perceived fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking song   123.52558248055173
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever   95.87206630373095
athos examined it and became very pale   130.06292985062288
it ran as follows you know that i was a good mother since it was for my son s sake i became criminal   91.81766114047456
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken   104.01943007621749
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive   77.08470767698799
in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her   94.65662564818878
that means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which i trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertainments   144.87609741483868
but the captain eager to escape from his false position placed between french and english cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birds was in great haste to regain england and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman s caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the french permitted him at one of the ports of brittany either at lorient or brest   99.610202539194
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived   73.48253052477281
cried valentine   127.97653816317224
monsieur is i am sure an honest man   53.71474358183287
the queen s famous diamond answered d artagnan with a sigh   95.05121103418999
it is because you have had faith   145.6190387833206
a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand   170.30778782699792
i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow   131.63794957131844
his nose though large was well proportioned   164.81563040656508
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other   36.514485297207614
i dare say it is a pretty one   178.87640755555984
open it instantly sir monk   175.4609561422428
monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a letter   168.84048303874192
one day if i allow you to live you will perhaps kill him as you have the others   9.914149280714767
how does he call himself   23.250620375140926
so that he related to me how in the plains of the pampas the natives hunt the tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety   122.5137571208285
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone   119.327550955425
and has he found consolation   132.38215024829972
come in here monsieur chevalier said she   172.3249838380864
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will   65.47457329444813
on perceiving him beauchamp stopped   104.26048941546347
i say there for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there   50.791024564957894
silence d artagnan   73.06657602051513
when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rose colored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be recognized   164.73027941654726
i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear   99.92960953288733
at rimini the room of francesca and paolo   134.30126494230154
chapter 60   47.37740789573405
alas yes said milady   107.72822919869422
mandé to make some inquiries after a servant as i can not possibly do without one   180.99210456404285
the coadjutor has promised   77.2979722801317
this is what had happened   44.93305517340305
mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven   132.29021460385027
but very likely i am on the road to it   43.480612936853646
faster faster   96.14419198031254
try to gain his esteem   121.4821140357083
how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea time   87.61946838259192
how can i know that   94.22977017494497
this track soon disappeared   151.84246174527493
a bed my lord replied d artagnan   130.78475427476337
ten thousand devils   146.86280895822543
ah ah murmured he is dantès then a member of some carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form   166.98884941104424
but that was not all   149.8130364964404
it came without the least resistance   137.5292254447776
the two friends were perfectly stupefied   174.29288183065617
the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments   191.57117670748744
i have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly   130.78653919542418
indeed you are adorable like that   230.84889152099504
d artagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guard s march upon the door   196.55994024921665
the road as d artagnan had observed was the way to blois   111.03326570484705
his soldiers formed a legion of devil may care fellows perfectly undisciplined toward all but himself   164.4547284211489
he could not be mistaken   129.35192465795902
you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon   7.322673214771655
but without listening to his protestations of alarm d artagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of athos who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall   169.38262722077036
i thought it looked much the same as usual   140.44622417049746
yet on his arrival morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word   145.54805536555702
planchet two hours before had asked his master for some dinner and he had answered him with the proverb he who sleeps dines   68.67416351821177
here was the officer d artagnan was seeking   109.37163954464486
oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed   64.78748622601213
on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible animals   141.247467080498
but after a moment s silence he continued the president went up the steps after pushing his sword into his cane   166.83786116217635
i am mate of the pharaon belonging to messrs   84.86782224400753
yes yes said the young man yes   19.756367272635472
and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost   137.0549145189235
exclaimed porthos without supper   191.1338692346701
he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one   154.21409599754423
good all right said a voice almost lost in the distance   125.47464943233541
you may believe me if you will   52.88639025226694
myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns firing   51.92313308935665
hush cried valentine suddenly   108.81871269017572
porthos whilst i get up watch the cardinal   182.77634058336412
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage   126.05736283463234
the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray   108.87248937434512
he tore the dress of the countess to pieces   108.44258845718718
at the hotel of said porthos   110.53702223818992
in that case my brave lieutenant let us leave milady to find out something else and go to supper   199.54174600848907
she howled as the hurricane howled   172.1267281395525
a hundred louis   90.24253495066762
he was right said luigi   43.50603834306955
now go down said the abbé folding his arms   207.4556130076723
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair   79.83062377104247
truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing   122.87428863435157
i tell you that you know these things as well as i do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a friend   51.69768637516404
cried de winter   163.25581227886795
at ten o clock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of dover and at half past ten d artagnan placed his foot on english land crying here i am at last   55.49190457912469
but the contract   70.57944132927383
and i shall find your eminence ready   115.13637218803133
from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal   147.12196874674277
you and i will always consult upon our verdicts   135.04192111629544
and when will the dance begin   176.46116232857
i know that is the coin in which you were paid for your poems   60.818039181841804
well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied aramis patiently   78.72299183846728
asked milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart   90.49110718357278
on a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two dice boxes and dice   118.47881251885484
i have an infernal spirit   42.25870290193791
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal   124.62922084167748
your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air   173.4161098575533
and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could see   96.96276493186849
that charming young woman with her is her daughter   5.859822963666076
my friend said he slowly i wish as the son of an ancient friend for i consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true i wish i say in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my reception of you to discover to you the secrets of our policy   115.1569387027228
you know that the english laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage   28.037118235945698
the other the physician   97.1784574613768
still there but i only speak of him in order that i may introduce the name of another man   119.8989269508256
i will make you another offer   116.77773377125061
i swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized yes yes   154.72491514472603
oh murmured the young girl   27.822582825864714
chapter 66   22.29249371184261
he has i believe two hundred thousand francs in morrel s hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself   152.31272205671527
if we had you my friends   161.00122432846257
heigho   159.10416901475315
sir said villefort striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion sir you are deceived   53.480353977575604
oh heavens exclaimed monte cristo can my suspicions be correct   153.2049085045665
cried athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demi tints of daybreak   53.592179106639826
another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket   177.34854669265954
but as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief he should have been louis xiii   121.36787798836907
ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp   133.44623860151793
yes and without violence said louise   22.03351121009618
things passed as on the night before   96.42200277413572
an officer who saw me with a jealous eye reading the lives of the saints to the mistress of the house entered suddenly and without being announced   119.22048774070889
taste of this   129.6060908841464
now hate me if you can   135.73313996205212
saddled   79.55347029459563
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared   96.18699811269349
attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to dantès   189.23775106262383
cried mazarin to the coadjutor   121.96693761702178
d artagnan walking and soliloquizing had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel d arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived aramis chatting gaily with three gentlemen   109.45010448905451
one of the persons whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house   36.274011406808285
what has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied d artagnan   186.20908083421176
dantès raised his head and saw faria s eyes injected with blood   49.49132883045459
do we breakfast or dine   61.50729199461962
i come to see you replied milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which d artagnan s letter had given birth in the mind of her brother in law and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood   93.32238860036995
then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain   80.18989507919969
you sustained me powerfully sir and i protest to you that to day i feel very lonely   99.56807988936409
0311m edmond preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island   110.91725942953644
and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugénie yesterday   59.329834035324765
to join the army under the prince count   161.1677533541989
the number thirteen was always fatal to me   86.75371931863651
scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale when they perceived three cavaliers d artagnan porthos and planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and planchet his musket by his side   110.31396124622452
if i were a frondeur said d artagnan i should knock here and should be sure of a good supper   97.51619706229087
monseigneur i feared i had incurred disgrace with your eminence   143.16181050383264
in five minutes he will speak   121.13360542918824
franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud   135.2350476518254
they then determined to depart   132.04079096755538
he was received in triumph as if he came from conquering an enemy and not frenchmen   95.50743035189964
let us visit this one first added he   135.72137367067555
i know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myself it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice and i must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god   155.7515238293569
but after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him   173.96129485665875
we will see   90.47389536650331
i learn this desire or rather i suspect that you feel it   170.77269610585742
their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly tenant   136.25428512575917
in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes gigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from men s shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs   96.62521645228688
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order   82.45498606349739
he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hour no change took place   68.80728500134495
pardon pardon my officer and i will tell you all   134.68229502309788
my death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner   37.45609129313348
when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival   76.91960353314747
for albert is brave resumed morrel   74.42316789167754
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier d herblay   142.99002095609004
what he did during these ten years god only knows   12.14962368127145
i have the honor to inform your majesty continued m   102.3710709933362
the man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he will   112.9848576285447
this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters   125.84753842005559
he s a gascon   46.475279006012784
said d artagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as minerva takes achilles in the iliad   121.8061845898222
it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector s voice called him to the visiting room   122.07336008616365
her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor   113.04620834038288
as he said this d artagnan gave a glance at parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for him   49.196058155417845
the voice became more and more indistinct   75.6279404075469
the cry proceeded from the grotto   99.04093607735511
do you know him aramis   168.05582499860247
is he too a bragelonne   123.51670142543549
at six leagues from marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural   110.82734144836925
yes continued the young man   165.4130395537989
oh my dear d artagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me   62.63303586393428
it is not natural for letters to enter people s houses in this manner   97.92246090119971
and i foresee plainly that if we don t kill each other i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation   66.13101024605311
which was as we have related that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two and which he had entirely forgotten   114.78917418373318
but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which i stand to you   81.1200800510832
but you say you have watched   99.6583881080577
and you suffer that you wretch   26.92734262527766
but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others   88.22016604344573
in england the post was well served   158.4367157385061
well do you not adopt this means athos   108.36106468053649
but stop   154.51988241000475
d artagnan looked at kitty for the second time   170.35957619799774
monte cristo bowed and left the house   89.64951164117177
de wardes one of the cardinal s men a cousin of rochefort   100.88226295571583
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch   173.3743508439799
and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean   117.03124757923632
faith yes almost said raoul   143.82971558461725
come guitant come along and let s see if they keep watch at the quinze vingts as at the barriere des sergens   155.28089780278327
that s the man my dear fellow   61.1329646893727
in that case exclaimed athos let us not lose an instant but set off   90.3610202841414
on his side buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of england was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal   80.82623660331939
i will warn them   134.78479209806522
go and rest   116.48806647370017
if it were as you pretend it is said he i should be forced my dear aramis to reclaim it myself   158.23544979187844
mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity   76.96335086855731
monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn   130.0698607286659
and by my troth i shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure   104.1921207607189
perfectly true   179.35326370425355
his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone column   136.66293938448857
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back   222.4153058161837
mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news   91.28352878269789
he aimed a terrible blow at d artagnan who avoided it by springing to one side   149.4615306838768
ah monsieur said planchet i will succeed or i will consent to be cut in quarters   88.56976777481451
he attributed it i believe to a political cause   63.57212176008885
my lord replied haydée i never will leave you for i am sure i could not exist without you   28.399133723713234
that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it   123.45579307574951
i would however beg your majesty to observe do you then also join in betraying me monsieur cardinal by thus always opposing my will   103.64407128764941
are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the rue saint denis and the rue saint antoine   111.80506951607411
bertuccio and go first   69.30360810987199
linen and wine are both being warmed   134.88568942744578
my father took me in his arms telling my mother i was dead wrapped me in a napkin marked with an h and an n and carried me into a garden where he buried me alive   105.75485134141003
he struck his forehead on the ground and groaned   8.343633914361106
morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but monte cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp   162.14090183388527
valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest   129.6875819379555
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m   102.46694769456327
thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirty five years of age   110.42509730308078
and the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require   66.81731302549622
and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room   138.50669161789966
i have told you and i repeat it that to night we rescue charles i   107.780481916387
but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence   66.4945570993052
and the musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast   143.81611833926064
then sleep here my dear count   136.5814452605521
they are worth about fifty thousand pounds   117.07554871408156
he stood badly with the liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists   140.91496022802406
these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray   99.59124364106475
what line would you advise me to study   93.43678124718664
ah my dear replied d artagnan upon that very horse i came to paris   136.78250761251542
when the operation was concluded and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a looking glass   146.96494128302066
julie hesitated   113.9043728854717
what happened during the night   106.6948221463666
morrel understood it   173.58592833087846
and their captain see   84.61560069441116
at this word athos and aramis jumped up   144.82261636611847
it was there he must dig   121.88825719361283
police affairs   66.05555363410862
yes madame replied villefort it is not only projected but arranged   181.22666726287275
to make madame in the name of the king and without prejudice to the respect which i have the honor to owe to your majesty a close examination into all your papers   175.36938771780373
i can my lord said raoul   130.56446806517545
40254m it is probable said albert   140.98805395046227
she had still four days before her   126.66292463541123
as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet her   128.09003637107827
well my dear parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner   143.87032489480112
but said d artagnan it is the queen s diamond   139.6058266670428
i congratulate you my dear m   33.19060111529069
oh i am guilty then   86.21269437754651
what was it that you thought   137.33692033169288
franz m   20.861313443046456
he continued to follow the path to the glade   195.388099155178
de tréville s was as gay and cheerful as possible   165.65876998254535
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused   64.22526827450518
the first available cardinal s hat seems to belong already to his noble brow   151.4690972744581
then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis called olivain the lackey who had followed him from blois and made him pack the valise under his own eyes watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign   92.0728723273593
dessessart and inform him of his promotion   159.7033575504621
my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers   56.43767001978695
once taken they will be pressed   36.14338212907286
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris   98.74035639986676
poor madame du vallon   56.09827537627404
you aramis why the devil did you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock   105.877909458548
at drake s or aaron s one pays twenty five lire for common days and thirty or thirty five lire a day more for sundays and feast days   141.10932730980596
i have not the honor of knowing madame danglars   88.60147249742961
no it is not finished   73.87480293871072
if you refuse this right you may kill me but i shall not fight   103.04071396090774
i shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care i will promise to watch over him i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then i shall have done my part   105.46964673905015
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child   59.04476465583486
said the landlord   123.90049950388628
himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear   107.89401369043604
he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud   97.81050901397252
and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs   163.44642400938324
must i leave alone   105.68406661809556
for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button   128.7615794837773
since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions   133.73412068320954
beauchamp s i found madame in tears   151.7930541188025
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence   154.65647469077277
tell m   135.24385930414763
this brother was my only friend   123.67977429888862
those that you asked about yesterday   112.17878682155053
though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean   180.67798181949212
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant   59.8137914174786
non capisco do not understand was the reply   137.09084280675881
he immediately signalled it   107.22421518187055
one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind   144.61699328276032
i have warned you   73.81183016953842
assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased   139.64150239762506
it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca   182.9751512045525
he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him   134.0122511307504
and he turned around so stern with anger strength and threat that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another in order to escape and some of them even rolled into the seine   48.96387744817709
at me   142.28815920537915
and on what will you sleep   92.57390616537137
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor   203.74576735429093
do you say so now mercédès   51.65232553822285
this i do not comprehend   79.99666328161908
the truth is i m very sorry that i did not strangle him as you advised me said porthos   191.4010099086052
make inquiries albert but do not be angry without reason   51.63982587098096
dost thou know noisy well   58.16532418656899
she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first   112.0377359039639
appeared walking fast   69.65463343048825
but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said château renaud   162.66966518218715
he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired   151.95770329649417
then he added with a certain uneasiness did you meet them   102.20104852006926
and it is not yours   64.39650955054611
and it is you you whom i make responsible before god and before men for my shame and my infamy   86.34435755073011
oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour   175.0230748405464
d artagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in english come being with the classic english oath the only english words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower deck   140.57662915766676
that s it then and the foolish fellow lost all he had   142.17319159564641
yes yes everything for him   86.12721879974073
accordingly d artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him   165.9606385229735
but shall i likewise return worthy of your love   101.09826021346932
i am doing what is right   161.5054573245278
de tréville entered bringing a sealed packet   116.65417293192642
close by here monsieur replied the notary a little beyond passy   166.9095060734575
and if i were a woman and fate had made me a banker s wife whatever might be my confidence in my husband s good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk   119.5471373124517
you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your son challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live   103.49920948286172
and yet in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain d artagnan when awaking on the following morning had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth they had been so impressed upon his mind   145.47653188532712
no my lord madame has visitors   127.14703095835671
at that time it was believed that the separation of the musketeers and the guards would be but momentary the king holding his parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after   146.90174154930887
and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him   98.63009014013389

he unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it   76.36475832164068
a man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning   37.355708867036924
to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge you as my executioners   134.95329614719114
and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone   109.67630935038923
he is not curious thought d artagnan   145.20587373724672
exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude   172.65558989841506

soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat   152.77823407851935

it is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world   164.26772602197087

athos aramis and d artagnan surrounded bicarat and required him to surrender   94.03556445353541
madame de longueville was persuaded   123.8271919048158
as bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back   64.87532634062475
monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl s arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian   139.1787687117767
the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine   136.03259035582147
to reflect   58.530199389799
besides they were followed by the curious who hearing of the wager were anxious to know how they would come out of it   30.913596330985627
it was d artagnan who was waiting for him   31.78020106345852
with your tastes and means of gratifying them continued danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade   85.76563984972624
for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered two   258.8724936341333
i would contest nothing   114.63987133717953
well you will surrender the harnesses   107.52390885374723
caderousse looked at him with amazement   93.14224159539003
richelieu who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him   122.3552709188811
said aramis blushing   71.99977589174826

he knows all   176.98076261383312
luigi vampa s bill of fare chapter 116   161.92198576396436
i am at your orders   94.64248667059826
you were walking one evening in m   159.2647912860769
do you remember aramis that it was here he received that famous bullet wound   115.73285803120127
at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act   115.0703318266838
no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her   122.1396389764105
so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who i am and for what i am come   129.20127357624548
but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of god s creatures since that day the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair   40.27090586881506
you have only to wait here till i release you   152.7809852096621
exclaimed madame de villefort the punishment monsieur   207.77560950431885
it is as i tell you   26.59292678130727
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands   147.1709431007471
said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamp s last remark   100.09885262969878
de la trémouille to interrogate him himself   113.6117054488272
do you think they will grant it   91.82729886276489
is he not a singing boy at notre dame   113.37443419156517
i examined the thicket with my dark lantern   44.785216177110925
athos did not move   83.74300287255758
what do you think of all this   109.01782061583907
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am   18.657911535441627
said madame de chevreuse say on   63.65748538496928
they breakfasted in haste and at six o clock had already gone ten miles   121.17412086383928
the life of the four young men had become fraternal   68.24122775998921
the rest of the troop took to flight   78.61784697064346
you can sign it   149.11488595548087
exclaimed villefort in an agitated tone   107.17188456331735
he is waiting till your majesty is ready   46.534732984153976
good day penelon returned morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain   99.04231116242921
nothing at all said groslow   14.651774970249775
who informed you this was the master i propose to you   142.479964105162
and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs d eau   106.07730655086627
oh ay   111.99443786442534
that s true said m   74.90852021143311
asked debray of the sergeant at arms slipping a louis into his hand   132.80343812286748
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down   152.68397221313523
that is according to the sense you attach to the question sir   87.67997911374678
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron   52.828072597551134
oh this time returned aramis i haven t seen her   198.54846740533674
if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person   217.48436971786447
i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twenty two years ago you know   61.98883094286916
her name her name   121.73761315720076
your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on her   105.7266549336551
for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife   104.92593991676146
cried porthos who had a great inclination to vent his ill humor on somebody   109.44268186218473
d épinay arrives in paris 30319m my dear grandmother interrupted valentine consider decorum the recent death   37.91813550498978
yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told me   140.63503025416603
but otherwise he has so little time to pass in paris and consequently to spare to us that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure   113.59354295975537
are you sir the chief of the people who brought me here   204.34930874818068
so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all   187.1804971397395
asked porthos warmly   103.57464019561554
i will give them   56.54884520498609
your d artagnan   112.05631985851345
we are gentlemen   161.67505189934684
but this is a frightful abuse of power   146.3613901361561
but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years   76.24221645609269
not another step he said or you are a dead man   108.89294467220506
he even went so far as to show us the way out   210.39762189114708
he left four days ago said d artagnan   103.44120120425843
while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties wretched waking dreams of grief the first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence   72.82303085092269
had already placed his hand on the knob of the door   35.8079682727879
but said porthos i think i have an idea in my turn   122.57358396105218
inquired château renaud   86.19350562249417
i am no acquaintance of m   164.24897611432857
buckingham looked at the young man haughtily   153.5487688937999
mazarin now understood that cromwell s envoy desired to retain his incognito   31.837474513569916
what of that   175.3169872911937
father that woman was a monster   74.88674376289642
d artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines   186.77233134114584
it is indeed a favor young man replied m   150.6967057532487
incorruptible   97.65825013931966
oh no monsieur   89.77255760659551
that s what his adversary met with   179.5093461681888
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs   36.09804646455318
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness   60.20353116000144
consequently the odd names of their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise but of annoyance   175.00887515714487
but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eugénie   52.44934041028884
no excellency returned bertuccio   144.73894667857792
what shall i say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence   100.5440877634686
have you ever heard of him   148.0213640023608
however i shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which i found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain me   40.006172397667356
monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in   118.12888230150843
but as before she expected him in vain   52.388383282407695
for pity s sake said the executioner extending his arms   89.04322013687258
i thought it was for something else   206.19711686451083
at the end of a quarter of an hour m   109.9670048712266
there is your jussac thrust paid for   53.381761424250705
as d artagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything   13.381347407973749
however scarcely was the imperial power established that is scarcely had the emperor re entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers he found on the table there louis xviii   80.06271448483317
it followed that d artagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friends athos porthos and aramis   77.53197360251102
taste this cutlet my dear d artagnan   57.30788102822128
you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matters   71.78929333053097
in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar   42.85478067624673
comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when d artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal   58.14408462679751
then put me to the proof   161.78260700580103
be so good as to give me up your sword count   103.95206676073653
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look   131.6923733151591
i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue   83.80626617625352
a moment after caderousse s face appeared at the grating in the door   98.48092236465129
hold your tongue and take it   91.67356481561801
yes replied madame de villefort   134.65913228670198
but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation   140.69558838843656
he had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness   130.17706887394286
political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation   39.52172288598652
you are right my love   95.70233109060563
indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down   62.009486044640454
what will it signify if one two or three more are added   179.25198980684914
in the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not   119.51766228789431
those are kind and cheering words   128.063744896424
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow   101.46577569555595
but methinks i need wine   128.85024110157747
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me   65.12648716713153
de morcerf affect me   80.30166759106172
read it yourself and monte cristo passed a paper to albert   116.86160412483734
said the jailer   67.71400703465666
i have also sent for the procureur   70.97501356893238
will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of silence   86.89767750251319
noirtier resumed m   119.8790796640305
so that he is quite elated about it   85.06489226843674
and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers   140.7491930146196
dead or desperately wounded as i left without having been able to hear anything of him   163.55284894546992
cried d artagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement   99.52920750953022
i will assist your memory madame continued the count   120.95632173904565
i inquired immediately on my return to paris   103.6157223953166
i understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de paris   81.55872224889032
it is i who no longer understand you madame said felton   48.78674077880383
then he passed into the dressing room which he examined   75.79375952418593
will you not give it sire   135.7231146033259
it was caesar s commentaries which la ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor   104.1738286044748
have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart   111.05348846995027
ideas do not become extinct sire   45.067488927860666
and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouth pieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers   137.99396154190188
one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder morrel of marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor   98.33065129998964
he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four and twenty hours   90.55345375222176
and i have none   42.36002421804662
if you happen to have any debtors make them pay you or any creditors don t pay them   165.3831302062057
if you heard the cry of mad dog   143.1652954289551
andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long   107.50767555742617
is in fact unlimited said monte cristo   118.1036674370606
go cornélie said madame danglars i do not require you any longer   49.72850809786226
alas said she i did all for the best   75.45274804003026
fine counsel indeed   207.81729580852448
thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile   131.21228668048064
tis the same thing you understand me d artagnan a court   24.63288329779479
has it not been agreed that i should take you with me and did i not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure   103.52618610996832
here s a sword and a dress said porthos   213.2104734771468
ah replied he guessing franz s thought i know this is a serious matter   157.71902836766714
and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire   33.70356147909014
for the count must be furious   143.83704552002607
withdraw young man cried jussac who doubtless by his gestures and the expression of his countenance had guessed d artagnan s design   50.69873270079232
porthos remained silent and motionless   88.8794168256002
he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding   136.73795420909988
well ali my nubian believes me to be an arab   31.172892032309775
poor maximilian   120.85253718111753
be sure of that   110.31457498327498
the mercer had said that he was rich   111.00075307717381
you intended to give me a two franc piece and see you gave me a double napoleon   118.49899239111191
oh then you were glad to hear that m   182.48363916368982
answered the abbé   61.890832891142466
which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you   163.40096475926163
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds   155.47851908968036
the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable   83.28724944312994

he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du musée but strange to say he was not there when i returned   124.72836379363774
it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear   138.68417502392

we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction   177.1848502395497

but just stretch out your hand   143.51804960670913

cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name   80.27036900582175
and i say that murders are committed here said morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months   76.74324138866197
his words were brief and expressive conveying all that was meant and no more   74.22626056662654
you will speak in italian said he   71.87948208225349
but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefort s valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness   41.94763751860705
de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you   196.2281634803303
i do not see morrel   65.928602672632

my father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish   101.26975086426825
he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him   179.87646148244994
for as soon as i leave this place i will tell everything   112.40488857666864

cried bonacieux   146.31978190700403
he is most likely at my hôtel   140.94097832415846
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars   128.95796066246385
that is it my son   107.74301073855916
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme   86.5937326122182
you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship   129.3970271064433
de saint méran repeated the doctor then madame de saint méran a double fortune to inherit   36.275124982545165
you followed him   81.05404576838853
said d artagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court affairs   108.81066846244363
a silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion   118.08055778047414
and the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step   215.37685106752713
in the first place that unfortunately your husband is a simpleton and a fool   186.42598143022332
it was agreed that milady should wait for felton till ten o clock   63.63442482189487
middling   114.06873471695361
athos asked of him in english   102.42697230023201
de saint méran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression   159.18184460221988
you are prudent which is still better   145.55659743441223
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience   25.731374667490655
my servants are examining the bodies   113.92575965206866
besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible   77.38644273147021
we have our clothes some more splendid than others this is our credit   5.417181086089457
your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening my good man and i advise you to tell the whole truth   98.25404936873798
you succeeded and then god snatched it from you and brought you to justice   156.04532271992034
it cried   97.4487230320888
i had but one gerfalcon and he died day before yesterday   26.47922944121524
i only repeat what i have been told and like my informant i can do no more   37.02991915860919
but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine   124.03922160938538
this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of aramis   173.35847148551173
why don t we go in with them   178.77764076508186
i must return to my post   32.50724573732181
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending   169.75671063673693
my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board   126.75323585610423
danglars said edmond smiling i will say to you as mercédès said just now to caderousse do not give me a title which does not belong to me   184.13761210122803
my love for you   99.04274967941814
an old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hands   67.44741423850581
but what do you advise then   101.08493616868697
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily   102.40265432035697
if you deprive me of that take away my life also   69.72358094409091
exclaimed a general burst of voices   85.91994725421773
how many shots   105.6460607961935
they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it   53.20678711151152
then i can well understand your indignation my dear albert   24.315516687233597
oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered albert   101.05349273889193
but athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made   31.575868390467917
but as the prisoner is a woman after all i wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to a woman if not on her account at least on my own   146.1421075161492
but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses ah   161.3892045493645
bonacieux where art thou   95.86587340142223
the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced   81.08169430917263
what consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase d artagnan has done me one good turn he has destroyed broussel   149.04390873915332
the sound of heavy steps was heard above his head   49.34463883380508
never have i seen you look so young so beautiful   110.16881302791776
the groom cried aloud for help   100.81974777019983
nevertheless bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open arms   164.62469008546066
yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions   209.9197016386569
we are forbidden to shed your blood   47.979543267324274
and yet the two young people had never declared their affection   198.6007386749952
but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it   111.29785193229908
once more danglars bit his lips   128.7652761480266
his parents are unknown   131.67852910228453
we lived together we loved we hated together   106.5688357717888
patience monseigneur we are coming to it   150.3853756765128
let us see the dungeons   116.41660367140867
milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy   118.89861722536617
then only she pretended to hear the sound of felton s steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees   72.72060788811547
all we have hitherto done in the matter has been child s play   89.6361329290271
don t allow anybody except one person to enter here   51.321212373221236
the lower one flew into pieces   93.73139530694442
i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage   222.7321904524336
the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her   117.93860601009987
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too   169.13016015684153
for upon my honor you will kill me with your indifference   202.91862866996837
tis an unfortunate year for kings said the mother   185.94767565697396
we have before stated that all the servants had fled   95.56496731814366
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i   122.12520426675668
and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship   96.9126844252365
on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his oath   192.57767243122572
this was followed by rather an awkward silence   113.5725202578037
i begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal   68.03473146747706
laporte entered   92.80274598129134
are you quite impervious to good advice   132.62656967515787
occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event   128.54727868183758
there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony   150.9155239938626
but monsieur louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me   132.01014173290662
you see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is ready   171.26373708218193
and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with d artagnan are you thirsty   98.45263655084932

i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m   204.63539209126418
he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it   115.39604555306649
at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards   27.93900321940579
it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame de villefort   153.7484934846535

and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête   120.42047211838735
there he found everything arranged in due order the accusation examination morrel s petition m   180.60475222461852
i am going to scold you   98.55483747540757
d artagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features   111.10878107275215
there was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it   52.11179231654035
but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady s chamber   113.45251248363138
the people were shouting and running about with torches   137.56040308785438
i had the money with me   80.5454308911355
that is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit france and be an exile   199.4400893506363

bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable   42.31834683596655
in a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post boy and horses which were harnessed and put in the post chaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap   148.17243484053344
the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a cicerone who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his appearance   86.57043802322849
we shall be safer there than in the doorway   195.60658668511462
that s where we are   116.18245128504958
the captain of the cardinal s guards   97.71039839077955
from seven o clock in the morning a crowd was stationed at the iron gates and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the privileged   60.35989540942095
nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this   119.86517784382475
can you mean it valentine   145.55240868784287
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen   100.15736465893502
de saint méran and that no less surprising of the countess   144.17851779775845
yes for it is like one   141.01106784130317
well what have i learned since   173.7716648371934
i went to work   198.59421861588265
dear mother interposed renée you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside   72.91750617054991
he calls that a language   113.10803931000018
there is now a truce and a conference   115.25873805146665
the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise   79.2399431275771
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large   99.75632088020612
i shall strangle you both if you don t get out said porthos at last seizing mousqueton by the throat   128.49863085035858
ah said madame de villefort why did he not take wine   194.24202197745564
cried the unhappy young man if you doubt me question me   112.90458609606566
perhaps you would prefer being alone   97.13918505590507
and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond reach   121.31716945383555

but the mourning   121.678678570257
rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp like the hissing of young vipers   76.32249932988879
coquenard she could not restrain her tears   62.5255613544026
it was a sublime and charitable thought said monte cristo and the whole world should applaud it   51.25852168354008
the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you   62.34306026646628
well then i will content myself with arresting you   143.66398546254672
listen said gaetano lowering his voice i do not know if what they say is true he stopped to see if anyone was near   145.16975061382615
villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study   94.23983898042677
everything degenerates   63.104471247219514
danglars your banker   142.65194143031667
valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre   104.96291316333102
don t be uneasy on that score replied villefort   125.92707769453469
i am stricken by fate   127.41899489957746
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace   129.46968911692477
for if i satisfy some i shall displease others   152.95443159142127
monsieur i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation   21.91885649004338
there grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit père lachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous   101.35830873521722
perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m   157.7285267118786
the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration   124.56005140605826
i must try and persuade m   64.13125173482592
the wife and daughter of charles i   115.84954103122881
the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper   38.03182012508239
this point of union was noirtier and it was he who had just sent for morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of barrois   212.73957738052638
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration   160.41130496727183
speak now the queen herself releases you from your promise   88.6147988877787
and having first married his banker s daughter who left him a widower he has married a second time a widow a madame de nargonne daughter of m   110.50682772468895
milady gave him her hand to kiss   112.85182988318256
now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself   115.63463336029402
scarcely had they entered when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor   164.01736169788379
i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand   150.30487651060207
gracious heaven exclaimed he   31.527772140086114
d artagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head   56.33263950789534
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat   98.77812084057281
but it was not upon corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish   94.53905581650605
he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the south had small hands and feet   75.92902083108666
but as you are satisfied of my love you must in your turn satisfy me of yours   146.330772867573
it was i the comte de la fere said athos rising and bowing respectfully to the duchess de chevreuse   109.9505584156324
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune   231.2975515773516
from congo if you will   175.47514634323755
but unless i am much mistaken there will be a storm in that quarter   83.69568071896705
arrived near a clump of trees he stopped   204.41832007230045
i made myself some   45.329568500874046
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais   138.10741492505556
the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic a bon mot which had great success   50.600765509521395
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold   103.45433758521807
we need no proofs   84.5188929161163
at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her lips   32.74415223371835
and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service   190.5130906878628
oh it must not be called suffering   90.71628710930725
i think him capable of everything   211.44258063220175
and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he proceeded   80.50220427977011
then you know what i have suffered said mme   180.37241487049175
and you have come here with that purpose   150.00358576263864
you think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors   219.55087092388374
said monte cristo and i have forgotten my smelling bottle   148.5616142614693
oh mon dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king   128.6116424547344
oh that depends upon circumstances   136.42960680915127
he is a subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it   129.57046909522398
is this the decanter you spoke of   93.28329965166701
it was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey   96.40586973810584
no replied athos with a singular smile   167.0238803854337
you were in the south of france i think   148.20989305643985
i have none nor have i ever possessed any   121.54651897051014
he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living   102.49711188373678
thinking that i might wish to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice 150 000 livres per annum from the day i was married   105.51790474002345
why exclaimed dantès with astonishment do you possess any   150.28545421674357
zounds i thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room   85.57431465275442
i dare say it is the doctor grandpapa   113.13667828364534
she was seated   182.33112443924182
you see then felton i can do nothing but die   115.39463574550741
and you did not show any favor it was your duty   123.25078519226895
la chesnaye said the king let someone go instantly and find monsieur de la trémouille   87.91711595412785
cried mademoiselle d armilly taking the bell from her companion s hand and ringing it yet more violently   147.6419479876754
i do not accuse them sire   83.75434123533213
anne of austria started   151.15589836184446
i was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls   145.67128999053807
aramis suffering at once in body and mind had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts upon religion and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double accident which had happened to him   168.92306062025344
fernand was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow countrymen found danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor   95.17140254135373
asked athos quietly   51.637675811967895
i beg you will remove your bandage   111.73058108975283
two hours passed away   149.34000250276335
as to felton he hesitates   156.07457405782728
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady   144.13731496564876
he had passed and re passed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there   117.9897067926417
you know you may say anything to me   93.97280238740746
this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house   98.83864719417767
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room   122.4293291888771
he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets   122.55339040584374
i do not at all wonder at it one can not think of everything   185.82914254899293
the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand   36.05093451815823
you are not mistaken   176.2160188784967

ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative   76.71552690175108
de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort   156.54360556277345
it doesn t surprise me said d artagnan in a low tone to porthos that mazarin would have been much better satisfied had i crushed the life out of his councillor   57.00803030502621
war has broken out in flanders   148.9289432571608
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant   68.95119666751839
that was the principal thing   68.80870880475314
the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you   147.76396288553053
but i warn you i shall defend myself even against you   78.062205825403
you stand upon his property   110.54299519170377
his excellency does not receive visitors today   72.91195589523583
the name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up   110.75165085744472
and whose room is this my dear child   110.15323724685103
because he is in love   171.49907556661404
30023m m   142.3030679506174
perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master   155.52354731052094
the count of monte cristo the very same in whose house we are   97.01442037446898
my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious   138.45062106381422
always ready   79.30948790349998
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever   164.9847819645442
seven or eight hundred thousand francs   79.84404064506137
cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of athos s horse   82.97020762109422
yes and much more   124.17392997058523
as to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin   85.28950415323023
well here i am   40.25542302946127
do you wish to see anything more sir   146.4522605747475
asked madame de villefort eluding her husband s question   131.25083275366077
is it that excellent m   196.48854661484629
why that s as long as the almighty took to make the world   86.39657787055589
read it again dantès and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense   75.96635553682547
must i go too   59.7123475341853
the stone seems very brilliant answered the count   137.65993881193083
i expect you tomorrow morning at nine o clock   138.46006005858635
sir said de guiche to his tutor we will precede you and you can rejoin us on the road to cambrin   123.01584568043744
at this moment the tumult was heard nearer   117.9914329613895
said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself   141.24074132665723
but contrary to all expectation when the 31st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision   152.13232274599335
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily   112.68325573709674
it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt   175.08155391633483
s confidential valet who never left the door entered in reply to the call   108.96788330252821
exclaimed d artagnan impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature the native brightness of his character   147.4799443339104
morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles   78.91257130220146
that puts a different face on the matter   110.11129809679207
and i will get you the torch you ask for   109.8014976678979
but he did not know that matters had reached such a point   120.74140911735789
take it take it   133.56872515192092
count you render me sadder than before if it be possible   136.16540244131886
and he jumped off his horse   106.16569303343923
he is right said porthos   133.47857735100456
forward planchet forward   120.56354491149588
take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of   94.9158101572838
de tréville was not at his hôtel   68.43673899572826
to place my lackey at your disposal   136.3105647487303
yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning   124.19683327743509
that man knew of retreats more secure than rueil darker and more silent even than the bastile   163.66042787889526
i should adore you as my patron saint   181.52393448088867
willingly said d artagnan   173.54935723909486
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat   105.25240755836698
you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude   110.30445388143525
now   146.49173456369869
you were rich when i married you but little respected   124.30094569114925
i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this much desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself   158.32780633472984
ah stay   68.77597080714821

these words struck d artagnan like a thunderbolt   164.42920997790526
but when he reached the door he paused and then said at what o clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready   106.50262127156708

the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them   92.53424498992484
besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture   173.1920971444843
the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun   82.98455826873928
when i entered the house the first thing i beheld in the middle of assunta s chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months old   60.366087309581296
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer s wife he did not forget his friends   83.52591464015688
here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following   136.64175704162267
danglars informed you of the ceremony   97.6638456372384
it is easy to suppose that morrel s agitation would not escape the count s penetrating eye   18.62891002653474
not a modern picture among them   96.78854435399867
no it is for the first expenses of your settling in paris   125.53581867864057
never mind said milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper   237.58953886249301
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become   155.73183884845986
no sing it please   121.78024902615985

a burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a groan   94.67012002389784
as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure i saw she would ere long become a mother   93.05137608276092
the count from the moment of first entering the drawing room had not once lost sight of the expression of the young man s countenance   81.447594955827
it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death   130.6729386700732
ah baron baron said albert you are not listening what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you   123.88896304564992
your lordship must have observed that he could not continue his journey   134.70825749254197

oh beautiful life   95.30557821616873
what horses   57.653850728489864

the former executioner of bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by spaniards and who is now being confessed by an augustine friar   128.1034324048266
in an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted   88.13194876284481
now the mischief is out   20.052867967550483
his eminence expects me in half an hour   195.37805705577586
you have no longer any business here   54.79946707516908
no by your eminence   12.054259451249791
well that was a temptation for two wretches like you   206.5156070835006
what interest have they in your death   99.46824799246451
but why are you thus agitated   149.28401387375794
i may say with lucullus if i could have anticipated the honor of your visit i would have prepared for it   94.70440912114456
morcerf dishonored and dead   44.81651886471704

then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death as i now am sweet beloved valentine   79.60573476857235
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends   198.23923497852218
we have money   119.90271747401549
but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world   29.750093917600736
porthos at the sound of that voice started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years   98.82768373122254
i fancy i remember it   109.87460430073295

give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on   128.17414880648644
the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement   130.91448367796676
but you stopped at the idea i hope   95.71966989614043
these were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept   88.20221231770347
40241m he was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his hand   166.6698681351727
we can only save you by being free ourselves replied d artagnan in a rapid low tone   115.7184285862797
we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea   134.01296958963752
you met on the same day you first saw me   151.714303486424
he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument   107.57827049296198

it was nine o clock   108.7198632342311
felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall   51.329049287841265
but if i mistake not continued he here he is   150.74911054382335
he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble   82.40440503118151
yes madame said d artagnan   87.05264293633536
i proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready   142.72896583913172
by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon   84.54025318133617
murmured the comte de la fere   143.70743580416922
dantès took some louis from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him   102.92871380526734
d artagnan who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with impatience was beginning to attack the quick   106.08697352870497
if you could but persuade him to come out monsieur i should owe you the gratitude of my whole life   73.16582727161901
upon his return to haydée he found her still very pale   113.93964136101908
oh yes very well   117.63560702954148
and athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag   156.49230885996326
i believe everything said athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sighing   113.88080331464889

he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew monsieur bazin   117.13174981292464
as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure   117.56703553270815
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her   26.015313410931583
as for the old man his chest heaved with his panting respiration   140.9110900061295
how imprudent said château renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him   97.83861076108047
their vows were sacred and irrevocable   131.71967809727948
yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle   120.48412247292043
at that period a te deum was a grand affair   107.97925949411236
athos went down to pay the reckoning while d artagnan and planchet stood at the street door   109.8548552531096
because replied d artagnan the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest   8.717113682057246
cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m   35.67595021578481
well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape tonight   122.62552308849425
for my part observed aramis i can not say the same as you do porthos   139.84714803972517
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired   124.5831998521448
the king commands it madame   148.56816878326615

he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell   120.19600902876935
it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened   144.66766869903674

nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children   98.70442240949521
valentine rose to fetch the dictionary   170.6451693860208

for after all who procured for me who had never seen either you or your illustrious father the pleasure of your acquaintance   97.640006806531
but the mind of the procureur was made up   64.50061571880357
danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment   56.940699377319724
pierced hearts   171.89766327356193

said the cicerone to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly on   195.06463189771364
as he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying al suo commodo   143.34041268562407
mazarin shuddered   60.24611958948143

discontented sir   114.76620149657775

oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that i have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended   136.55581598506862
i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villefort s ball   145.10775194310153
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer s son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which dangling from a leather baldric hit against the calves of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback   79.10400574378691
but really said d artagnan   21.308555814732287
porthos instead of returning directly home d artagnan alighted at the door of m   83.54116110123137
he called for d artagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him d artagnan not being on service   44.76609687851942
now then cried carlini rising in his turn and approaching the corpse his hand on the butt of one of his pistols does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me   98.94400886097218
it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery   126.0955877842111
and they apologized to him for having carried you off   182.2095553470638
certainly replied the jesuit a little put out while the curate greatly delighted turned upon d artagnan a look full of gratitude   144.58890712564747
milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window   106.3767133685488
the man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces   120.89885083408436
my dear friend said monte cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart   166.4021763217276
then he must be playing in the garden   86.18271149553894
then turning to monte cristo said m   165.19972781324944
to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts   152.25637812273672
and for the second time haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips   118.56305944194963
said scarron he may die now   66.36702762471691
and what said your cavalier to you   13.206589709904932
did you really think me capable of that   152.55489063942832
he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice   38.640278034933615
have you not tears in your eyes porthos   35.490275601883454
now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust   139.54552973437256
the fair woman on whose account i gave you advice which naturally you took care not to adopt   20.229943763518122
and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth and grasped the old man s senseless hand   88.5905137935726
then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers   80.90339596758692
planchet called his master s attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty paces   62.176268850130874
said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words   106.24656253392867
besides he is unarmed   82.27769742486018
thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dantès had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared   61.01163026022367
let us do things in order   123.59946375578356
monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests   118.8189431364645
he called himself vampa   86.24883972621554
when once i know the hour i will hasten to this spot you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a carriage will await us at the gate in which you will accompany me to my sister s   107.46089328635806
the petition finished villefort read it aloud   109.16460864749654
said the doctor   113.28436743491442
let us sell the diamond   142.98560176590638
let him decide and we will execute   150.49046659121566
she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias   120.39607940898283
yes pray accursed woman   93.40348655818812
among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had sought at the risk of his life since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent which you should never have allowed her to reach try at least not to miss the man   149.94218972503626
is it not a halt in death s anteroom   51.17943518332896
you have known him for some time then   114.76357133190832
as a proof remember the date of the day on which i had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night   127.06050657212816
they fell into the line of carriages   77.00329139408453
when a carriage is chosen it ought to be strong   121.57791275649623
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter s absence   84.82022356274138
besides and rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke i am going into the country to make a tour   157.5912931205376
de villefort a second time raised his head looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa and became livid   77.40893669630475
and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce   81.68475841781154
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did   156.43653626940585
in the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor bonacieux with horror   121.36265519344138
at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio   100.0239787097486
murmured the queen whose teeth chattered with fright   111.6055472401565
i have courage enough for any danger i can foresee for every misfortune which i understand   80.05053765404278
in the street of saint thomas du louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of quinze vingts   142.75025739346978
yes it was so my lord it was so in the left side and with a knife   50.18972022606526
my dear athos i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you for my life   84.29516950579907
it was indeed the poison which could not deceive m   78.72598051456629
d avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish   117.9721421370029
the duke glanced at the clock   169.04821648495573
but the man who has abducted her do you know him   47.671593477014625
but if you have any commissions for paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them   57.5081930725081
then turning to monte cristo he said but will you undertake to speak to the father   89.8343217892107
do they refuse   114.16074865071188
the queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care   138.5756347014277
availing himself of a handle that projected from a half fallen door he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow then advancing to the door struck thrice with the end of his iron shod stick   100.20324879682401
it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone   79.79122632501965
and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they   151.92458388182092
the worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed   118.45618786404015
willingly if you wish it   130.3763014178806
has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth   95.19498865423876
the general looked around him with slight uneasiness   92.54354913176192
the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano   108.39362073559724
and he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to think   113.44959864732073
yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them   81.26496849902635
anne of austria deprived of the confidence of her husband pursued by the hatred of the cardinal who could not pardon her for having repulsed a more tender feeling having before her eyes the example of the queen mother whom that hatred had tormented all her life though marie de médicis if the memoirs of the time are to be believed had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which anne of austria always refused him anne of austria had seen her most devoted servants fall around her her most intimate confidants her dearest favorites   143.11065375434939
no it does not concern me   189.36318390985207
the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day   68.71870631489391
when the game was over the duke laughing at la ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis d or to go and drink his health with their four other comrades   151.26168562250555
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent   100.28080521247132
do you then suspect anyone   164.8298535546174
if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter   66.38808803640347
monsieur i have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me this morning so that i have not a sou left in case i should be cold   110.34595121210833
de tréville who was returning from st   112.72956037337106
she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated   156.63859720348682
well then wretches cried danglars i will defy your infamous calculations i would rather die at once   32.82802276119379
besides you have no need of anyone to introduce you with your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received   180.3268332203699
the bell of the convent gate was sounded   89.43230769887776
where are these papers then   199.62061872989432
no you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondent s message   98.71987158022557
a little   89.56315243707353
you are at liberty to speak m   115.20555947176847
such news was decisive   38.02630466746811
he could not understand how albert s fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation   126.21837397680565
you are certainly an extraordinary man said danglars   89.77919974815885
what then is this monsieur scarron who thus puts all paris in commotion   131.63377394766553
gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to repose   20.751595799947694
de saint méran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness   71.37697216998384
listen to this dilemma god is god and the world is the devil   76.71395403720359
as to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if ever i escape from his hands   141.2529895428907
good morning creditor said he   74.5189998575142
i will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged   154.42476885463634
but here is the letter   157.22411376780565
well then madame said de winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him   126.47280350283053
he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed   98.80493628237204
your majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between monsieur de la trémouille and myself   42.63284131639318
the evening of the betrothal villefort had as we have said hastened back to madame de saint méran s in the place du grand cours and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon   126.7394238139409
valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred   81.62243267389246
what is the matter with my horse   131.10005486080087
he marched between athos and porthos pressing them tenderly   132.0625895038691
and if anything should happen mme   93.65912592062992
but your excellency wished to know two things   170.2891438460238
how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either   207.28527097492076
supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child   147.9650583329435
twenty five minutes past nine   85.49891519276099
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams   132.44322979113554
whilst they pursue him the king might escape   100.85271052293379
let us see what porthos has found for supper   170.61357159554188
haydée may hear you perhaps   131.1211609303222
how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment chapter xxxix   138.7752778978013
too long a wait too long   168.1154001299601
it was a melancholy sight that of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastisement   119.85885295532859
then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain monte cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions   61.30437838411831
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you can   160.9139943488579
he was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal   134.42713876529052
and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me   147.53819026781008
exclaimed the poor queen raising her eyes to heaven have you indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world   127.87645964599338
two windows only of the pavilion faced the street   82.86999541124155
only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis pay and a share in the profits   24.435905253123394
0319m you are welcome sir most welcome   134.48230779639727
but hear me continued she   135.8893110118056
to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity   98.82536984142232
bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his master   120.68710516450611
if you ask me for a day count i know what to anticipate   41.22352565127608
keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars   85.84204586057055
and he wrote to d artagnan to hasten his return   114.75945961263486
if it were otherwise if he treated me diplomatically that is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupants he would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly   17.605076846345014
at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows   150.78549126159493
felton did not enter   59.252804615082525
she traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage   143.51755828756507
not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea   43.01868690753997
i ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen   24.93302301022949
i thought you might want it to show the abbé busoni   209.07896790539286
at the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered descending from the palazzo di venezia to the piazza del popolo and mounting from the piazza del popolo to the palazzo di venezia   81.00245600849931
d artagnan had appointed six o clock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was right   177.79498376348485
i adore rome and i have always had a great taste for archæology   132.6326382891754
ah father said albert with a smile it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo   115.6333671334661
just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn   122.22152842385094
but a request preferred with so much preparation ah do not fear sir said mordaunt with apparent simplicity it will not ruin you   124.00480674642871
to the end of the world my lord   165.34795303663887
the man whipped his animals which cleared a way through the crowd   125.55776755957804
one is weak   102.78367381878549
milady received this look like a resigned victim   115.85532014826418
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed   86.17000853947764
at last after renewed hesitation dantès entered the second grotto   115.50032913348791
but i could find nothing   160.9796672661729
said he timidly   134.71150033400383
this mendicant insists upon speaking to you and pretends that you will be very glad to see him   60.52186958025269
oh this is what i feared   100.46748798790026
i will be with you directly   128.15695462459544
there were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself   71.2675870153723
the count watched him   18.314024481110437
it was then observable that the substance was greenish   140.5821680942267
at last we have something definite said athos   149.44448137997307
but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him   144.139319322619
describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him   103.47990154766572
i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit   100.35000321999942
franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting place and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui   58.00337352503263
the doctor flew to his patient   125.74183782772319
what a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation   152.60442410427999
the first person who sees her   146.3261612600344
i have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write   131.77056403696878
and you have a letter   128.3652182271085
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant   235.8958666250765
and you are very virtuous are you not planchet   91.21994654238571
and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself   91.66220359095989
i am taken   117.31910760022862
there remained athos and d artagnan   144.4811844434319
bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her   127.14475307407359
i had no doubt he would return the following night   102.16280479299115
the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again rummaging and rerummaging in his valise and opening and reopening his purse   100.37413815605994
it does not bring him a bajocco   178.39635748534076
at the denunciating sound the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother and all the community would go to prayers   164.19067920019816
by my honor by the faith of a gentleman   140.28347441556056
the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven o clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named   176.2836602244333
she was mad with passion   137.3806804202327
the gate opened a carriage rolled down the avenue and stopped at the steps   172.0380884883321
and you have lost it   142.26953480749034
do not seek to know how i discovered it   209.51708536338836
caderousse sighed   123.6927208689512
and the best proof of it is said d artagnan that he has dispatched us to meet the duc de vendome his father who is coming in his turn   170.29491086883073
asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion   145.93861234046796
then turning to monte cristo i hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she   44.119701662946426
at six o clock lord de winter came in   102.09333194479841
a marchioness   146.41847879747573
but whence does he derive the title of count   48.089898383636765
upon what subject   192.14959984219928
there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly   161.82019775693385
and la ramee   159.00306655278052
but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit down   129.36765380500458
ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature   42.382678187656666
you confirmed my opinion   174.18386640863335
they sat silent and dejected   143.503847374272
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit   103.927071867699
he had only to step over the corpse enter the boudoir take the child in his arms and flee far far away   118.08966482043613
d artagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of la rochelle   165.43924530844578
but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into d artagnan s breast crying one for you   77.52424674276347
oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well i promise you   174.48042752642664
even his misadventures are of use   154.3810961842428
why in the first place i heard it from madame danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others   100.16279493676797
monte cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few words with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared   162.36261619106708
she thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill   116.73284310593154
right   132.6811013042972
the president s sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the general s and had no guard   70.50751979061991
and now you are assembled gentlemen said d artagnan permit me to offer you my apologies   45.1584111960302
de saint méran my mother in law madame de saint méran barrois and my daughter valentine   33.25553753368747
i must look upon the past in a false light   222.21245700155202
it had long been an object of ambition for porthos   98.23466712806626
she might say that athos had hanged her   179.43264746258131
every one stood up   87.25151349663969
i have given you the choice between america and tyburn replied lord de winter   97.72937127265531
since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he belonged   201.17708585617072
it is too much for us two   147.19672310783542
but if the queen be guilty let her tremble   47.23052589585886
it was thus with milady   151.62915152079734
for three months i struggled with death   108.59859976660528
alas murmured he with intense suffering i might then have been happy yet   224.90992380606218
she took it and looked attentively on the count   122.32611363508511
but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner   156.6874473123558
yet the king will be at the head of the army on mazarin s side   93.2807712284834
they went to rueil cried aramis   100.17290397498219
four marble steps led down to the water s edge and below them was a boat floating on the tide   87.08406329949025
come to our house tomorrow   170.36138131131057
nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise   39.717566428727224
this morning you rose at five o clock   191.2181270278158
you rochefort   162.11853971953224
empty your pockets   161.50786398877923
take as large an escort as you like   182.2564561902325
but all this indistinctly as through a mist   57.30103283925174
at the same time d artagnan felt that planchet slipped a note into his hand   199.27786103523127
a shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of m   78.78690368225246
divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown   148.11688403173474
his head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell   146.98177678658394
i will help you   104.22753477077532
exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his paleness   67.29350681995244
ah to be sure   44.34399096612886
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint   92.61470299590445
and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said andrea with a look sparkling with joy   132.37636344775888
well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron   94.84094114714371
what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude   165.74466525761173
in the midst of one of these swoons i heard the door open   162.43768830383442
many might take for their device the epithet strong which formed the second part of his motto but very few gentlemen could lay claim to the faithful which constituted the first   139.93507366414175
the law   114.51680549459596
he was wounded in his self love he thought that it was in his love   72.68888394672439
zaccone   103.84183945688487
his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him   50.61020237839857
death is always death that is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from grief   67.91619012683459
screamed milady   16.865252332622177
milady held out her arms   100.98250959310276
now then go said the marquis   133.04533978690108
if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said albert i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks at least   163.65425860522052
tréville said to himself if the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failed he who knows how bitterly i execrate him to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him   63.88766608680838
but i think you have still a good number of falcons sparrow hawks and tiercels   205.58346272488689
the epistle is laconic said d artagnan   142.21180537867477
has no one owned him   101.12822005528336
there is the beginning of an adventure   133.3532989568892
milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed groan   196.79865606276553
do you know the house of thomson french   63.428494041615934
but in that same banker s study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocket money you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry   107.37448963422511
the devil i am   223.78058206632232
you know this chief then   115.10977374264955
what is he then   95.95508908191239
she said and why art thou not at notre dame   114.13479182437203
and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them   125.80001611407104
ma foi i haven t consulted my daughter   88.9334983099757
yes i know that you charged by the side of mordaunt   113.82574454332772
my uncle answered mordaunt   93.68087073021036
noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side   121.19570745299895
a third time at monsieur de tréville s where it surprised us all   115.78048425150634
and he felt as if he were also dying   57.96778228786458
oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice   122.93682443659935
the fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example   101.60169346188195
and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced   179.91310467731023
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel   81.81113098748037
we can wait for him   95.20100568480562
sire said the queen i can send for them to the louvre where they are and thus your majesty s wishes will be complied with   162.1908110298352
and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of aramis   74.92331418273247
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen   26.114178869006878
let us get ready gentlemen   76.54898085206392
patrick discreetly kept in the background   49.92981324893215
de tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the king and then for himself and his own friends   47.109335625910546
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthos s long cloak and d artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it   131.04012337920744
the baroness then thought of m   99.74798358067157
at the end of the piece étienne entered and announced to eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits   114.63397971175019
the baroness did not wait for a repetition   117.30528177657133
how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life   171.99157617289632
for the sake of fighting   188.03568858384082
he gave me his hand and called me his friend   178.34240138019487
come near to us from time to time as if to speak   146.44429733788877
believe me i am glad to see you   37.84190214447656
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty   160.2496366237708
said d artagnan in great anxiety   152.5476982398683
i told you true replied he coldly   143.00997774243
because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs you expect five or six thousand perhaps ten perhaps even twelve for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost   159.861597109009
i came here only to meet de chatillon   119.22431690067884
it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair   126.58066584461177
meanwhile we shall reach london with the king   46.51539236388841
it may be worn at via reggio   149.6588304171112
pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really do not understand you perfectly   157.72295413167672
you say very true responded debray   65.64350055676144
besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his father s name before haydée   63.6232155607007
bonacieux sorrowfully   87.37551127182152
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate   151.93209688390758
he added that he did not know either m   161.67630303585207
sire cromwell has arrived this night at newcastle   114.07834244284041
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from d artagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence   112.92288021705718
in this way we shall not be separated for an instant   133.66520266486472
yes said he at length it is so   187.2561952292861
then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had done the guilty deed   107.0179105064346
i have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron s heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand   224.3172317016059
really that is a good idea   13.959790348338856
i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition   77.95732126899317
my husband could accompany me   78.86856268798874
a murder do you call it   155.43705558105552
you are not busoni   83.32811401661023
she was of the color of ashes   95.04054387912656
the door opened and bazin entered   41.71008084323498
but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another step   127.90733249055997
no friends left my lord   70.44523938792551
haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes   59.27310808125189
and what will that signify to me   83.91654915572163
at what number   170.9215363676987
that would boom the market   172.51081932094723
my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question   69.53047602235178
that such is my pleasure and that i answer for my will to no man   90.02433241218051
but entirely on account of her precautions the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty   110.8783519478764
it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it   179.7517041027839
he clapped his hands three times the ordinary signal of lovers   182.3482610696263
that will be the simplest plan   131.97240738529354
faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness   114.27438138594232
shall we take our valets   136.303042673112
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me   73.89387912288197

they went to find porthos and at the corner of the rue bac met mousqueton who with a most pitiable air was driving before him a mule and a horse   94.0798723116783
if the serpent be dead why not its brood   75.23107557666577
and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city   55.84520257162448
and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my man   138.3316169306
cried his custodian gaily   80.37180162088953
fernand more happy but not more at his ease for i saw at this time he was in constant dread of edmond s return fernand was very anxious to get his wife away and to depart himself   69.04288349314382
good bye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl s heart was filled with gratitude   6.213562162699773
and that executioner you saw that executioner who you say told you everything that executioner if he told you everything told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brother s shame and suicide   95.75911933476777
caderousse s plans alarmed andrea still more than his ideas   98.26053621600026
that is quite true said barrois   172.16013384542072
and woe to those who forgot that i was there   47.865335972550085
i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag   147.41691613175203

for his father s death he was in some manner prepared   113.3087566208932
we must return to paris   188.94789937087276
it is enough to have killed the mother said athos hoarsely   102.83339113509884
but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to turn   15.277298418453128

one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris   123.34869184860554
the next day they stopped at the hôtel de flandre at brussels   73.71742812345119
but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure   93.47273186723505
all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred   176.02236446746605
and the rich caparison is that mine too   75.92765067413904
is it important that you should go that way   100.898739259634
my dear blacas said the king you with your alarms prevent me from working   103.16892070741281
well replied athos have you not heard what d artagnan said   123.21566464267903
the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs   95.18813648285264
well then you shall see it now   77.29142615494868
and king charles x   121.98452100630053
the tutor cried halt   116.8474881462613
he opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him   49.40322364228767
then i should become simply no   74.02620072694475
for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments   108.07871630889994
why the fair is on at beaucaire there are always jewellers from paris there and i will show it to them   152.33727286875705

no replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that   128.52436676059926
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out   124.96100083839083
where has the favorite gone   18.379148382996817
up to this point said faria interrupting the thread of his narrative this seems to you very meaningless no doubt eh   107.78723233863944
and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected   106.37773240365172
but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of   47.9612052781024

my recovery lasted six months   110.66770874813085
while working night and day i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel   83.32830546268583
at this very moment mazarin entered   57.66517007758239
the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview   160.88972617353636
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy   86.78956170860658
on his return home albert expressed his wish to franz debray and morrel to see them at the opera that evening   66.01635440227221
yes here we are said porthos   134.42243209523548
yes i recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams   84.25158051686816
besides d artagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her   109.89086800075019
a detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the corso in order to clear it for the barberi   45.1971492923508
they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows   105.51038542494433
listen replied felton in a low voice   103.28128480435926
the profession of arms suits you   130.29374926490803
the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count of monte cristo reappeared   154.0404697051212
at length an old worm eaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of d artagnan   143.80212346926825
oh my legs my poor legs   123.5482947067307
he is a fine young man of fair complexion a little too fair perhaps pleasing in manners   71.6163828719982
tis true however answered the sailor   24.17012182285376

monsieur bazin said friquet monsieur maillard you know who he is he gives holy water at saint eustache well go on   115.35260056232536

how pale you are   165.1415855609144
we shall be carried in triumph   28.082048734432107
and she fell full length on the floor   117.15668782183137
whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham replied milady   96.88475133495433
a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort   106.29477494871188
return with all speed   162.11808984605182
but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you   104.02800856807205
on yourself   79.36902841777408
very well indeed sir replied comminges   164.23764935121804
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god   81.48230045959383
said the individual whose description we have twice given entering the door what a great deal of ceremony   106.04961946331916
and he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box   206.93625434949485
said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven   1.0134019538737817
his visit of the day before it is to be remembered had been very short and very little explicative   161.8931981589215
did you credit it   115.46172919146758
asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor   67.20048676945405
de tréville nor the musketeers to complain but on the contrary for him whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had endeavored to burn   108.58669836783349
cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there porthos   96.98588738607751
edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins   70.58571008518017
i as a tender father and i as a dutiful son as they choose that i shall be descended from you   48.15578143958041
ah how good you are to say so valentine   120.0316398179409
therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can   117.8351471077382
porthos was perfectly indifferent   192.07743667457135
well be it so at length said eugénie   89.46152307852239
when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation   90.60027362590506
well you rascal what is it   40.104281501390645
you are mistaken friend d artagnan said aramis always on his guard   26.918102694827624
what are you doing here at such an hour   141.69050297415663
but did you receive my letter yesterday   194.92363189124646
i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin   66.705594832247
nor i either   104.45579085283978
yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another   138.8265604877095
at first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves   140.72446790312597
valentine rushed towards him   135.64766164055828
the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet   195.29280515161616
what can i do for you valentine   98.08222004217342
you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city   112.5133117866646
at eight o clock she had embarked   96.70679546478834
d artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family   150.4706133410704
most probably morrel and château renaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces   7.279451510144639
exclaimed haydée her eyes flashing with rage   199.30128189634834
you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows   70.66003412438126
wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard   119.25412218393258
the terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass   125.93736888063366
the ambassadors   72.3262252769903
he was already on board the admiral s ship where they had been obliged to seek him   125.12317423969672
colonel pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck that blow   23.296564202146797
there are four men come to arrest me   127.77646594034735
i believe said raoul that i have got something like a scratch on the arm   59.45736743510717
he fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention   142.73836357254947
you appear to forget yourself sadly   135.08489784828376
as he alighted he thought he saw his father s pale face behind the curtain of the count s bedroom   161.36036982660352
he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow   108.93933973776625
if he had only a comb and hair grease he d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids   92.85743215672566
the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as albert s prison and franz and the count followed him   95.40916304931231
that will be sufficient   94.05162517782458
while exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls they excited them secretly to quarrel deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants   110.62117934895495
because it is a secret just discovered   86.67639538970039
and what was this man s name   157.95308212957613
in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses   97.06811938024738
said the queen shaking her head   118.37549858576898
albert then took a pen and wrote frs   53.32282217733955
it is not my fault madame   117.17423475715336
do not bring on me the horrors of remorse   86.19801342429564
andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari   90.9894287686677
monsieur d artagnan said the valet de chambre   158.0600637322314
why should i leave you   137.6264949212099
have you any knowledge of him   94.6546022817537
i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine   86.05605132240046
my lord they shall be yours   77.73630092377174
at the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of god   144.1804403221078
may god protect you my son   82.83058740570385
as to d artagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black   128.90180154874832
the fowl had not been poisoned she had died of apoplexy   84.86269069647649
bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man   70.21714817767088
my friends said athos this is what i expected from such hearts as yours   85.78832498212978
since my brother s assassination in the streets of nîmes i had never entered the town   116.91579600292627
oh come then come   124.45422828824479
own now that you did question her on the subject   60.80649469655883
the host obeyed   150.59399964813716
they left the chamber at the same time   61.741003368143915
are you then making a thesis   79.2401324604923
what possessions what reputation what pull as beauchamp says have i   109.96258314306479
stay there said aramis   99.82044946686011
that is your name is it not sir   140.20711242941067
and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor   67.28518418470048
give me back my child   117.84376016882891
you are free you leave the count s house and you take your mother to your home   96.8154218423827
one gets to like without knowing it all those beautiful objects that god causes to spring from the earth which are despised in cities   75.09053701640092
but your eminence is mistaken in saying that i am young   49.6071219549233
his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty s favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for ourselves   64.26499573573969
do you wish anything   143.88689145210864
16   95.613498426648
just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation   122.31268976460362
the true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door and even the second was passed easily enough   94.14640970568126
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de château renaud   142.67636588302628
the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface   165.25706226040052
she is at béthune   45.34923103033081
this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame   73.04357059216434
your hand athos   229.14451022186853
the old man spoke not and grew pale as death   92.68430811279998
there was already three feet of water   118.82558994208377
are you very anxious to know countess   34.97814173970845
if he should have known me again   56.88164738322134
care not for me sire   173.3964990618553
and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning   134.29062260201337
why that s impossible   119.57103489247525
two shots were fired at once one by d artagnan the other by the adversary of porthos   128.65204487517352
thomson french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m   132.2469119178081
the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc   79.62018332699493
yes i was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not   156.50559685546548
i neither reproach you nor hate you my friend   56.85667374520979
we are cousins it appears monsieur porthos   61.97986089473607
this was albert s favorite lounging place   138.45793623142362
mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd   84.25152518042094
the youths spurred on   33.23795935008738
my dear friend said albert to beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning   112.48865432450499
she demanded   72.65871939521944
besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces   175.03020944653522
he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening   128.41711571667923
at ten o clock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented   158.72262265319853
if we are attacked we will defend ourselves   127.35111851811848
said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me   133.52126563692312
i believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it   65.3642945095447
ah you are right monsieur said d artagnan   140.66311291549943
franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired what then is this precious stuff   116.61173250708296
but what have i done to you   120.86802986513138
he is a worthy honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody   170.49412042189414
madame de villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other   59.34239369443056
i am going wherever it may please the count to take me said morrel with a smile full of grief   193.7307205310198
well said felton till tonight   87.60095716810429
die in peace   61.744965000580045
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy   143.23534829949926
like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous   142.43621068387742
casa pastrini   54.003857329712034
i exist no longer for you any more than if you had never seen me   126.59014207523151
and shall we begin at once   117.16681866290091
he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness   184.8068825767601
if he were not he would return to us   157.05675829788527
my worthy cocles said morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber   130.94730516905003
then would come night and with night sleep   142.11045600790993
how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight   64.6376854672817
said benedetto laughing   101.98384218098876
pray regard me as a devoted friend i beseech you   198.94650968602656
on his wife s request m   91.12709861420959
cried he starting up   86.33314685932021
demanded the journalist   107.99474565775986
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face   131.937497884158
at the door of the chapel d artagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for athos   232.7831862136722
i am anxious to see that young man nearer   166.68419437277498
there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars   121.4092484478865
you can not be mistaken   99.62169130989625
i actually love no one sir   122.06897448973429
why should not the king of france have the same chance as the emperor   164.60570678237838
asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt   104.06850332468456
a passage of st   105.66844015772533
debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow   115.24554492734339
my stables are at your command viscount   67.73062412448871
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows   123.34177538984036
to receive the cardinal   80.69747964105218
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph   173.41281649128553
fifty thousand francs   271.5932902330384
d artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied   158.19393343060852
they can not understand it   161.1718290311388
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash   212.06923621920515
i married that woman when she was a young girl   105.68764357024995
eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer and escaped   98.55616014546463
come and may heaven hear you   127.7563504346208
but to die   108.17207178213536
exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my ears assassinated   94.50787289651458
and yet perhaps there still remains some hope   165.05175217852462
now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure   99.77615194959687
a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent   43.034068977345015
why by your marchioness your duchess your princess   76.40235687318778
so the duke had more than enough to think about   207.35738490697102
well my dear aramis you may enjoy that pleasure for one of those three horses is yours   138.5158680087638
and who spoke to him of me   31.215003338448867
the journey of that day had been long and wearing   93.75654131198873
asked the lady   129.3258886553728
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers   123.32836561710019
madame said d artagnan rising i have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall be my life   163.96765444527668
at the age of five years   87.72242917313596
the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber   12.301903800258273
mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step   151.45809024111355
the first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion   64.28700493342856
if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven o clock the count albert will have ceased to live   121.70234548734592
the chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely any   70.95236412904946
now there is one said kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur d artagnan   150.71837302926195
but why must you leave me so soon   87.93193088012376
he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to him   94.76556639910767
then a launch came to shore took him on board and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor   110.4449747685858
useless   115.47482225037001
the wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded   205.43277578262018
he determined to make two cardinals   57.58164869394067
all is paid   79.32151814818805
as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail   56.572804981973384
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a post chaise is an event   160.02295756854673
he cried this is no moment for compliments   141.60970505584348
somebody is coming   37.14810102564117
at least you don t speak well of him   68.3620653802163
it would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel upon such horses   107.86340345127323
if you absolutely insist   49.80124913340717
there has been a misunderstanding   45.43103909048578
there were but three hôtels in this part of the street   66.53007584375179
i can assure her majesty that if she does not sign to day she will not have time to sign to morrow   232.7246016937279
you did   269.45779384821844
if i wish to leave   136.1524176141304
i am completely ignorant   86.98894802338984
the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one   124.69030373879177
and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort l evêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in   178.9643870786308
you have promised to save me from her anger   79.29075402126486
dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manœuvre was completed and then he added half mast the colors and square the yards   48.89130090192528
i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it   106.22524482439589
good lord   127.70336529295393
with your belt my lord   116.55916690044496
another to our holy father the pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the emperor napoleon to his predecessor pius vii   136.61737432044873
asked the count seeing him covered with dust   154.34863400548275
you are not so always   81.47512341356025
and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison   98.42196755346103
let us speak frankly continued louvieres and act in a straightforward manner   103.98799763771915
and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal   96.70636224915339
come i shall engage your passage   116.5110278762357
besides we are men   126.85111697709519
excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m   85.05589624527838
thank you d artagnan said comminges showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle thanks my young friend   184.36991673060265
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father   130.68715730117262
i had it from aramis replied the musketeer   121.97501262130771
and she rose with her hair dishevelled and her lips foaming   122.75420649251883
unhappy girl unhappy girl   121.23379499126551
as the day advanced the tumult became greater   172.0184466645419
in the first place i have never succeeded by that means   110.43545992272593
exclaimed rochefort   60.39055809593667
bertuccio bowed and left the room   83.85575215124456
porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep   132.7061263412995
that s true said athos after a moment s silence that s true   36.955621819104536
the very church in which she was to have married edmond murmured the priest   54.704429098908854
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered   107.57586156761434
to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans   131.78694381817868
we hastened to obey this order   50.10105677622927
de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips   136.56816052936924
i have never seen him put to the test replied raoul but he is a breton which promises something   159.21326816633143
and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it   145.29453533059137
this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the prince de conti s lieutenant   117.37473821640916
40032m sir said franz i regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle valentine   137.87365937655198
in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government   111.63202910777738
the coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed   113.01726049807465
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england   154.99015880328193
attend to yourself   83.30601783009482
here they are   85.4581177523606
morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of dantès from m   64.21075840588828
that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine   154.97100832531228
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dantès listening ears mingled with brutal laughter   81.72064162170759
moreover he was a viscount a recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815   126.97128100218988
and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship   135.87516313705518
speak as fully as you please sir said the king who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in blacas s face and affected villefort s voice   209.9472972178329
can porthos have negotiated for it with the duc de longueville   167.91957404473357
it is then buckingham   120.56735334231858
then he re opened them and stood motionless with amazement   132.44680237243352
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert   110.65941570308026
and that is but just said athos and he took aside the one of the four englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low voice   172.57810588797258
porthos alone made no reply   91.86266107966318
each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion   67.26210907795345
hallo dantès   38.01240621917451
d artagnan turned to porthos   130.03396703828682
shall you be happy if i do what you wish   84.06987629765527
there is the true reason   80.16239992389754
as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will take that upon myself   85.92965240158213
bonacieux alone   23.290683899638765
yes and no replied mousqueton   112.28335346435651
if innocent to be set at liberty   35.761410476576444
but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis   93.30067161873308
lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me   151.54693513706832
no you were not for it was in reality a little boy   241.1697422361226
now it is time that the malady should be over said she   183.2580553185865
he opened his eyes upon utter darkness   200.2006218923475
for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind   41.935964549793255
is it then so terrible a poison   125.92416160600679
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled   96.76159479248585
relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know it   85.1446006539316
this demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first   148.42456493220783
but added he seriously you understand it is on the king s service   124.3575866411035
i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks   127.13327566312367
i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   120.0914790596229
take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the treasury for the same sum   112.48751723814647
bazin set out the next day for tours and was allowed eight days for performing his commission   132.50855767993983
and now go mordaunt   134.65729825843516
all eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious attention   81.65693748672284
you are saying to yourself fifteen days twenty days   94.11263910692068
the peasants were in great commotion   145.95069812893183
what signal   59.88087670693098
i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father   151.82384961083227
threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocket money he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel boxes   117.91580847047447
no no my boy   105.08304247470552
now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not   69.21558276773125
all day dantès walked up and down his cell   83.41524497912621
downstairs in the decanter   88.39892325680367
d artagnan left m   90.06221090671826
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly   132.0172753289302
and then we have our hours of recreation and our holidays   134.80390055490514
but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves for my fortune is theirs before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude   99.91254387070887
the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there   146.8399805503388
you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet   187.64640097175698
the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest s garments as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure   115.9621985266081
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy   122.92722302351035
i see said the count in a voice hoarse from emotion   79.83127079589195
the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of   84.02760447023626
have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path   75.82030499010631
listen said the guide   71.07343526593063
everyone exists   132.22815329857355
this time said d artagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot i think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach france   88.76574957118956
if you would but accept my offers   157.8966625055032
but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too late   125.94665694156056
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken   139.87916497958628
cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord   65.23028055987277
i am fifteen years younger than he is   144.64556295363647
her looks her eyes her smile were all for morrel   145.52307528087692
said madame danglars   43.505490819890284
neffer replied the swiss enchanted that a man like athos could envy him anything   85.8758024450947
but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside   128.0416278763151
and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me   107.0945623360092
it is nevertheless the only one we can give   78.73565792031812
that he has given the diamond to us only   72.88585941882783
than the son of peter mazarin   112.7271184293832
do you say that m   121.3425445907276
and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied   148.59553611581737
we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant   93.56103650248471
then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time   110.46892298987302
come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better   38.46784660492004
and turning to her grandfather she repeated wa we wi the old man stopped her at the last syllable   113.07663370494866
i wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse you   94.23767036279472
la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead   21.31425055868968
and why day after to morrow   152.85788545515604
let us first withdraw from this house   152.53320760110742
but the thing itself is at m   91.29634334502796
give the horses some hay   174.7683849899036
i see you are a thoroughly good fellow and will detain you no longer   167.35045599415488
it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the east   57.46696727421024
when i see you merely you look like a reasonable being   131.4112209117293
now said felton we are safe   23.503352110320677
the comte de la fere can not be far off only the doors are locked   174.29423775552877
d artagnan looked at his friends as if to say well what did i tell you   98.51836818329426
under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance   107.29467643391479
a million   131.89776996500518
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wife s writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents   98.7632596615097
bravo bravo said franz   62.33686887411154
once in france he turned his course toward paris and reaching paris went straight to rue tiquetonne   82.2196918374777
but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud   77.22008463980353
god s justice   103.54244572200766
the contract answered dantès laughingly it didn t take long to fix that   82.78304316393195
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor   26.424079817970124
for a very serious matter which bids fair to make work for the executioner   138.42584504773836
said mazarin you are worth your weight in gold   115.57017276924033
perhaps all blood demands some expiation   135.97387056479883
dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek   78.68568991858811
only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues   122.8202658200411
what are you thinking of this evening   92.961295404428
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour   60.31474842953421
tis settled replied d artagnan   170.49584230051448
that s well madame   168.1587732502951
you have nothing more to ask of me my lord   174.25400191122174
we shall ascertain who and what he is he comes   158.20545748024318
since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the state   126.89954324462639
in this case replied caderousse let s have some more wine   21.751330195154907
demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo   125.70030841757574
they were both aroused at seven o clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for d artagnan   139.56887702524912
the answer known he had yielded to albert s wish to be introduced to haydée and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali and had not opposed haydée s recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate morcerf s father   180.8252434670219
then she looks upon you as a stranger   156.97420118859122
the two friends departed aramis to return to paris athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen   95.41853671381544
the two children grew up together passing all their time with each other and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters   216.44338646854183
be assured then of seeing me soon return   144.63490082408214
so suddenly   72.50311448378453
oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to face   86.94414741244063
but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away   150.62446216802425
the register of the birth of andrea cavalcanti of your son   169.42565161486746
said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count   146.68791163092837
27 do not let us jest gravely replied bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it   183.2775117053552
to the left a bedroom and a dressing room   21.1487162141854
i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m   106.04941672649046
i will begin again then order to conduct to the person named charlotte backson branded by the justice of the kingdom of france but liberated after chastisement   147.2056164250586
and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad   77.45673295298633
the two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley slave   96.56302887719215
who can possibly have told you i had had that dream   82.74883699354871
planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol   164.50426260821692
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then i can continue my work in safety   108.40097257433665
the horses bounded beneath the whip   47.34662410226204
he has six millions worth   137.96261845119
for as you very well know bois tracy is an intimate friend of mine and i can not allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy   181.51031040823304
again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him   134.64890029643163
i said nothing for we must have peace in the house   296.25130160695505
i will so advantageously bestow 2 000 piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for peppino   159.32724346279045
god forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account   92.06094441319041
nobody serves me for nothing   164.59894910227592
cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass   170.18773682846947
come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much   120.42890597337029
tis some travellers who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight   149.7124672650181
franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity   145.72086124329886
at last when pistache was sufficiently well trained monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment   61.46790026926789
i will prevent you   170.99626178584643
the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe   150.03298616950602
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you   179.08362438507316
noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything   149.77686817113647
improve yourself   129.02165707891388
50253m peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the fowl   27.113823909901768
was that my soul if i may say so waked in my sleeping body   178.95006123616616
these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before   42.87453521390388
yes said porthos that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church buried in this vile quarter solely for the sake of seeing me   49.471392121199344
all the same i should like to do him that service what do you say to it   129.98838829918537
i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon   122.72751819770268
in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it   169.22633629254037
and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure   117.74916713838901
take this said madame de villefort giving her smelling bottle to valentine   66.48827844507454
he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse   47.79451546735574
he immediately called d artagnan   98.20041330080888
and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of profiles   75.76681584907178
had you commissioned me   133.27190890388724
there is the port he murmured   119.2302390787521
which they deserve do they not   153.72536963752825
all therefore of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of europe   109.16975329544655
i did not observe it yesterday   53.11012571912576
yes but yesterday at five o clock in the afternoon thanks to you she escaped   116.82772055495458
so long as you are rich   177.4949708040648
you were asleep you are fatigued   60.32817835273193
but when after they had all got in it came to his turn there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel   149.77090944881633
said villefort turning pale   200.31090107573834
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london   93.46124971338901
see what confidence i have in you   63.97532206011122
those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony   45.278203837957435
from valentine the young man looked towards noirtier   89.29493983612808
duke said the queen blushing never speak of that evening   89.88587272756016
but you my dear d artagnan what has happened to you   118.24812065678114
your logic is most powerful valentine but say what you will i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind   142.81825057089938
that is it said the old man s eye   78.81547070420653
make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you   120.26050755599348
four arms threatening the four cardinal points or turning toward a single point must inevitably either subterraneously in open day by mining in the trench by cunning or by force open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain however well it might be defended or however distant it may seem   111.51937107978539
but how do you know all this   155.11939574301158
murmured tréville   155.1459601652105
when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed   84.54542024369391
moderato   90.68357089925846

andrea pricked up his ears   147.79846581908714

without reckoning mousqueton s wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary   28.560137680673122
after having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy   126.67132581260455
why did he not bring it to me here   111.98804289037477
his breast heaved   43.03581067646003
edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content   43.0641101815077
but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshal s presence as easily as you expect   178.16173727081298
your misfortune is laughable said athos shrugging his shoulders   64.42370870604927
grimaud entered   104.57719858418565

mousqueton cried d artagnan let us be off   92.53778982137916
then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier   72.19132269947652
at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait   143.94301571838704
adieu monsieur de rochefort he said   110.1086442456616
her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven   136.58400520558803
ah he ll come round thought d artagnan   130.1036701119384

one of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left   151.30577351159963
he was an athletic gigantic bandit with large eyes thick lips and a flat nose   142.31353613549817
you do then obey someone   136.87991644668455
de winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head   25.572459387896572
porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself   164.1530189351713
if you get out don t take it up again   11.51908137430135
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you maximilian whom i love as my own son   188.23888018119197
no cried d artagnan no steel   140.6072671205718
and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son   94.54195964309666
the queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by laporte   69.59981562002454
noirtier s eye was fixed on the dictionary   114.75403750571294
milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging down   125.0790014688864
and i wish to know what has become of our young man   87.20452161873607
on his right and left sir   41.51973894250217
and how do you know it   24.473147261053086
and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul   134.688437033852
but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt   86.74296762469598
if we had only been looking for porthos porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him   109.9279329740855
i can not cry   139.22820372630656
oh for pity s sake said she you will live will you not   121.51084937168528
major cavalcanti is already one perhaps   45.65257154649336
as it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal   77.81162017183732
i have the honor to be with respect etc   71.69515298046642
the frenchman threw her a bouquet   68.3194760110065
this parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs   120.55187203603252
i have work to do   125.02650038429138
and yet here are two culprits   185.31454177122777
i yesterday engaged a servant who had just left m   112.73628266620695
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will   104.22534946420122
and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage   88.87009150316128
de cavois instead of m   190.60689340973437
replied d artagnan and disappeared   108.16976221348632
well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with that   116.7248735360685
said baptistin as if that name sufficed for his excuse   88.43855834476582
de villefort s house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnut trees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance   128.78535338848187
the marquis de saint méran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii   147.12900429928425
aramis s searching look seemed to seek his friend s thought even at the bottom of his heart but d artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity   152.0777113757032
it is not for nothing that i am styled louis the just and he signed emery s appointment   46.24752361471555
it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs   146.78374061250622
is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power   149.9135393378724
bonacieux s   75.4834467076433
this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien with a pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox   57.58313912066009
milady folded her hands and raising her fine eyes toward heaven lord lord said she with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone pardon this man as i myself pardon him   99.25421949381298
enter   104.48658215332134
he assured me that they were two noble steeds   125.6791659716074
he was about to marry her when one of the caprices of fate which would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end one of those caprices deprived him of his mistress of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present and cast him into a dungeon   72.925883172558
said the monk   70.62160868807993
i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post   45.77551470796615
i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans   87.59435469226578
and the greek princess will she be here   98.38376496891607
the shortest follies are best my dear caderousse   161.794132362302
therefore she knew him   132.00927595464879
she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary   163.19247420684195
for it is not life it is merely existence in prison   86.56804244434088
cardinalists or frondeurs what matters it   60.60507541961215
it will not be a house i shall see but a palace   137.13349311693878
i have no business in london   52.106874940487735
but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent   187.6856746972066
in that case let there be no more question of what s past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him   109.29443207943127
alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened   141.90967664529296
and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself   138.32666334727932
on the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own subjects   176.63570157942644
whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you   115.36099578698716
but what signifies that   70.84342020898661
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar   58.05663182809604
he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience   133.9705278381689
he does not wish you to know that it comes from him   36.03240361087586
it was not uncommon for richelieu and louis xiii   6.850716422191624
imponite manus and not manum place the hands not the hand   50.151526297094335
he has escaped by this means exclaimed he   144.00006555323634
yes i know it said the soldier   111.81910685007408
i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly   78.85005051176336
the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report   62.16182131758453
at each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal de lorraine the cardinal de richelieu the cardinal de la valette and the archbishop of bordeaux   71.61113510812572
now he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a catholic coming alone the protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind   64.15218846814527
his first care was to see what course they were taking   85.58737588933187

the musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received   92.24744056281055
for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france   110.57667584680634
mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed   117.82556218923922
and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission   181.16407198220568
menaces i do not fear them   129.00720527102814
the porter was in attendance   76.58235334053673
my dear monsieur de rochefort mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man   68.63566004086817

ali with considerable animation made a sign in the affirmative   56.070876177296256
still my young scapegrace   19.408254535333015
the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible   108.54676924116033
he is extremely prudent and thoughtful   107.83405297966706

and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please   149.67904472327166

two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks   87.39921228233415
you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz   145.9209612633187
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth   174.83827378626387
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven   92.02186051258644
in fact the rochellais had made a sortie during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before   89.80282991561728
i own i was seeking them   33.19454955019482
he was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him   95.47691668618106
at length after winding about for a minute or two mme   147.91690114638993
three months passed away then six more   80.24573396197218
d artagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated   76.23551451889702
fix it this way   108.86882596681768
mazarin bowed   148.3134315804593
they traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses go then dear friend said aramis follow your own career   50.67821756485286
he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlet s stood on end and racked with fury he cried out silence sir   112.47056078704523
he is certain to reach the other   128.04883272540008
in may we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained 450 000 francs   168.18249425027952
d artagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous   103.01133234614872
27 said the inspector   229.3838220653754
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door   136.82308389903744
i think a little exertion would do me good   137.95839519014896
it was alas   105.80132803276825
yesterday it was choisy to day it is la riviere to morrow it will be some one else   158.589117258138
porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned d artagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game   117.84695738267375
four young men of the richest and noblest families of rome accompanied them with that italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world   95.01067140819565
we ll gag him and tie him no matter where somewhere   159.9050650434169
but in spite of albert s hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants   117.17115140649234
the riot becomes a revolution   89.35985375675652

the throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination   59.62821380437912
the bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration d artagnan enjoyed in the establishment   92.0804246656916
asked raoul somewhat comforted   157.98952603427617
neither of them had returned   192.80308726195247
then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe   126.96307134495765
to think of the parisians soliloquized d artagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or alive if alive in order to hang him   74.46402990007134
in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance   133.19316976357317
a furlough is needful   166.72261743649466
bring him to see me   95.92383319911661
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask   145.9156817479188
what do you think of that exploit my lord   182.97863246355544
is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles   85.89965903825247
now as ever i am nothing but your servant   111.4067509123889
know of the existence of this treasure which   119.5357242205896
do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to headquarters   136.35835098127197
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty it s true but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in him he is conceited and stupid   95.95026110762319
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done   192.69255339443012
it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament   167.81958581763803
i ve broken my man s skull cried d artagnan   106.75592555708661
four times fifteen makes sixty six thousand livres said athos   148.79861831836885
yes yes yes motioned the invalid   138.75530788035277
porthos didn t understand any too clearly   45.95852052088799
and i should therefore never think of including him in any general order   160.65393662733157
oh it will happen you may be sure said d artagnan   67.84990775095712
and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich   123.9146043980352
whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied de winter   107.06795468214443
morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in law s gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance   90.83809635848006
we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor   137.6291583536777
why my dear mother it is necessary in order to make your advice turn to account that i should know beforehand what i have to distrust   67.5924704051722
they will discover us   27.14656394253194
you speak as if you were already her husband   142.66121868817433
but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my august mistress   91.93243278336463
emmanuel sighed and summoned cocles   138.50283073006213
suppose i refuse   150.92758171664974
i do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows   146.49946143460153
the young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance   114.84807548508446
they are beating the rappel   108.51594590546132
as they went from the hôtel des gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit paris by the barrière de la villette and the other by the barrière montmartre to meet again beyond st   165.96414003436126
everything said olivain to athos has been done according to your directions   77.91135083854047
call laporte   111.61123197943394
but i know my father s and can tell it to you   158.24263079115917
but to grieve my father to disturb my grandmother s last moments never   128.98429750941986
said morcerf   204.05085042696908
by eight o clock in the morning he was at the apartment of athos   160.82660929513213
i am lodged like a chartreux   60.45676170862646
how do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions   165.37991177708807
family   90.03358939572502
he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated   77.30405088553542
one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and tréville next or even perhaps before himself   134.26443262212752
they heard the street door close then m   123.25288524992258
the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the cardinal   150.79730951692486
shoulder muskets   109.27822354990678
dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about him   116.2141127558783
the promise it was indeed maximilian morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day   150.92963223764534
thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796 parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries   85.55058258181344
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom   57.68310831987033
if he makes any noise stifle him   135.31269289554356
the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand   69.04021315653125
there s the sun   114.40899565812346
i am going to sleep twenty four hours   161.80977947575374
madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt   145.47946675791772
you have an order signed by the cardinal   141.52218955545308
an explanation at the opera   87.04807109878678
with the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning   92.7361044415448
porthos knocked with his hand   66.90854203209446
d artagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think   92.76688503424651
wretched men   115.66548120675827
and he gave him his hand   27.806810891400843
they have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the palais royal   155.24706589460123
hem said monte cristo in his turn   64.33624485179843
on the contrary everything is in the kitchen   112.54283654405565
that s true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man   140.09665430210006
he could not foresee the consequences   213.38725520317325
having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him   121.48892103699426
it has happened and i really can not pretend to lament it   149.99847616143592
my wife and my daughter would die of it   97.87115216528557
i am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as i wish   68.11937642518782
be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to sufferers   58.23003325940768
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green door   82.12320062359636
then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then   128.39883211852987
who has betrayed me   26.711914788142664
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you   148.61946078747906
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions porthos and aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him laugh   39.762514187734496
one day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to me   97.45159639720207
when i am happy i wish all the world to be so   85.23024759901249
asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party   63.23712997908134
to return when d artagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure   105.05027465159259
i assure you replied the old man i did not turn to that source for recreation or support   155.684165710856
that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him nothing   141.33180845862438
at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lips a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young man s frame   164.7508194879525
what fortune   124.45677549827244
in the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs roman laws and frank usages   116.38286502832176
what ails our friend   117.77916967731093
mother said the young man you know how gladly i would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening   128.68588566490735
better   104.64986396687307
aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orthography   195.26511803426672
when i invited him three months ago he was then at rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone   84.47987215934094
my lord i am twenty three years of age   101.27240282768247
but sit down sir i beg of you   122.82870039778167
you have a claim being almost one of the family and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find persons willing to accept them   146.30276120606322
i had none but what i made for myself   184.8425874301089
the twenty men marched straight toward the barrier but from behind the beams from among the wagon wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time planchet s halberdiers appeared at the corner of the cemetery of the innocents and louvieres s bourgeois at the corner of the rue de la monnaie   63.927763029529636
the notary   99.78051305658724
you are a noble minded woman and it was your grief that disarmed me   174.6138723442004
the cold gains upon me   109.35653539236466
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary   83.45465302842203
look look cried the count seizing the young men s hands   145.1537454135209
as for that m   136.41068764109718
ah there   123.23850818708729
i presume that she has returned to tours   134.00266686275367
in gastronomy   101.09747220737049
but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness   146.0764136665045
danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere   110.52471054444656
have we come to any   91.71758954245203
for from the moment i have either listened to or heard them i shall be held as an accomplice   46.66664092150337
then did you see him edmond   145.82976547347698
but what do you advise me to do   113.35840431421683
and he gentlemen was my brother   63.84580420702849
was it ever known who this miserable fellow was   147.40684920362395
noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room   179.60097089389652
he turned towards his wife   188.3411842142849
if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat   162.5050453068738
they could not go to all   179.531201354626
this is not his writing   140.8315304029193
well resumed athos swear on this cross which in spite of its magnificent material is still a cross   156.34204975639162
the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali should attend him   198.5761554217899
why do you offer me 4 000 000 for what is worth 5 000 000   160.52375355364092
d artagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him   129.9261841927185
de boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police   82.96638284592142
my   99.21983845994022
here my lord here said she keep this in memory of me   158.66038826925794
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage   92.39623709382164
morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness   107.12172059644286
come said d artagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where athos is   113.17359145553371
you may be overheard   154.84611985222855
but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks   115.52895590307561
let me fight like a woman then   145.7933879780263
inquired madame de villefort of edward   159.07284654115819
as the ransom of a young christian slave of eleven years of age named haydée the acknowledged daughter of the late lord ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his favorite   75.41504581956323
you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made   92.57861553443553
the weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful   100.82841841038062
besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on that this issue was near and could not fail to be terrible   201.24318735215004
officer   105.07920788453826
scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows   177.16044766333943
i believed you dead   161.6148150661046
bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet who then went satisfied to his shed   139.03615720763423
do you propose to me to do so d artagnan   96.96719881740577
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness   112.53619973001835
what the devil captain one can not win all one s battles   146.6444736650103
i have heard he had three or four millions   28.680789663768522
but how shall i ascertain   156.30530439516968
henrietta maria and mazarin   117.32772351657955
well now your hand young man   95.24524392715959
well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited   97.39564079648707
god who knows all knows without doubt   52.56874149814435
i am free then sir   133.06215191625822
perhaps god will pardon you but i never   48.50025036814223
added caderousse   181.09907635091187
ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all   103.61222285771794
said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy   175.6806799754606
yes he said   9.826578548392604
he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes   96.09802159019887
asked the father   63.11975302627491
adieu valentine repeated morrel   116.94505897245155
it means replied mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that our parts are changed and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners i am theirs   118.11041874033397
ah it s all over   149.85438976285036
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a labor saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre   102.37329641890233
de villefort and valentine at the same time   80.97080570535664
they were attired as peasants of albano velletri civita castellana and sora   66.35046472225778
come finish your cup of coffee said monte cristo   154.37692828853307
and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether i can be of further service to you   126.43375442147124
the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared   126.53822271863119
she took the risk upon herself   141.22535812288726
and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through   110.34562358242607
but you should take me there one day with you   139.43242141672062
15 on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor   250.11386866470005
his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer   154.87437183380092
for peppino   162.3570672078348
de villefort in condemning a culprit to death   42.85801805817903
well my friend there is not a moment to lose   134.71774902053858
i simply told them where you were   167.62559308103505
the coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by athos raoul and aramis   90.82982859589923
remarked danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart   120.30119865056197
he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major s little finger   185.67917049148562
monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness   143.31571198520788
we will not answer then   161.84506662817498
i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say   88.89254314168201
and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their origin   84.7525529139616
these individuals are under arrest   132.18016148429282
should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it   141.77328011962828
i am commandant of the port   70.65058224261404
is that you   110.91617052043311
for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre   183.4511158424138
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating   85.31404072683516
she is rich a countess and yet caderousse paused   109.18055098199935
but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback   195.79358185257504
patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn   43.33514405570165
and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest   61.00913133970806
and the matter seems serious to you   127.1184586618526
we ought to die together   107.44021945996124
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud   93.33257960546302
you know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination   66.32995292787086
five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor   98.28905636874987
there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes   219.5747763547152
you will then be at my service   116.35541878091774
40046m yes   70.46199328634353
besides besides what   139.8660971202402
why three days ago the emperor had not landed   29.929441088916207
it was benedetto   34.2730452447836
a few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse   144.66063075977834
porthos and i will stay here   71.9522885339895
the queen s paleness if possible increased   167.4820435567389
the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching him   94.880727741816
your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably   80.17425944190055
come come calm yourself my sweet girl   79.69725678234973
eugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to valentine s cheeks   118.53053239121523
sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver   125.68427063023391
then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it   153.0505888027207
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace   36.83425279285416
it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and i could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom   119.16597017936608
remember i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers   74.21026479975671
listen beauchamp   73.11086235649896
well suppose i go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries   191.3679839991823
olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the count de guiche guarded carefully between them the spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use   109.0396766285506
he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music   103.51283385801715
take it i pray   127.62381299410481
a horse is mortal   44.28346924811524
madame faltered d artagnan tis twenty years ago i have a good memory since i had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville of kissing one of those lovely hands   61.11127299777707
the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily   50.557929177879416
well my lord four men resolved to save her   32.5521498984279
and you visit him   100.38340865587377
but did you not say that my kind grandfather s precaution had neutralized the poison   111.74495979679065
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses   68.45536781146726
but it is not a horse for hard work   161.13668450158042
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses   107.59140178137181
bricconi   37.18857792895763
because they are looking for her where she is not to be found   98.91785606669163
lord de winter on quitting d artagnan gave him his sister s address   178.13562283109954
well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain   184.73829459572812
but he said mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow   156.67246448545404
one of them was called the chevalier d artagnan   122.88845824266566
said mazarin astonished   140.8606314690723
one man alone remained in his place gun in hand   149.66136360060494
this lad for he was scarcely a man simple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for   38.769056039976164
it is but natural   116.27667564927516
he drank to their good health and the travelers returned his politeness   61.58569553730101
nothing replied milady   174.05723668669344
yes we are severed   61.630520916922244
said a loud voice from the staircase which porthos had just mounted   19.865640599194876
and d artagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from villeroy   96.40097582822469
no he replied only hark how he sighs   157.83474647266632
fifty thousand francs for being your father   160.15894144083987
d artagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is   96.61904597582728
the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability   144.45866596899884
and how far back into the past do your recollections extend   55.5380642498953
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude   104.35920521425237
with madame danglars   158.9854015276323
i will tell it were it to destroy me   108.97984073579067
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened   58.00606343921509
oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me   80.4265210439444
and is he still in love with the catalane   151.24473491562534
what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not   107.19870732919136
you have an hour   137.1552115163019
the figure put the comb in its pocket   77.39359320745658
louis au marais   44.0570929200495
the day however passed away   156.6310746100026
the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution   81.54682967788457
you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french   28.16883457461614
you are silent   18.482134414914498
first you purchase a house at auteuil this house is the one where i have committed an assassination   12.411240755059367
it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced   146.65308979260274
30099m the third act passed off as usual   71.03533880784086
the return chapter xxix   194.45010930505842
gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor   130.8606128685109
who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one   87.26941106442005
the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder   132.46934395571716
indeed count said morrel shuddering   110.66326906935649
no my dear vampa replied the count   187.75349352862256
i overcame every obstacle and reached the goal   122.7796469433591
if you had only to deal with four men d artagnan i would allow you to go alone   123.43635782136938
can he be seen without doing so   179.7149509717906
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz   156.31405536091762
let this house be the first repaid my son and respect this man   163.32325893924957
when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered you my heart was softened   149.40957132451265
but the child the child sir   133.8848466887568
you madame de villefort and her son   179.0632163679627
i do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice   164.48316091173456
unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the duc de beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action   124.41764682995141
you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to d artagnan who pressed it respectfully   25.75024471049646
that will be the signal when i call out jesus seigneur   162.17794637998094
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber   206.29842233184817
you don t know where aramis is   177.96991600334593
valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it   146.10056242273856
those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames   52.19222384640931
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit   97.93615918295771
yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman   189.60532403601093
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athos s lodging and there finish their plans   200.3077979078351
the terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the guilty   99.55774161452234
oh curses woe death to you   101.77536024163655
they spurred on their horses   123.93281784153304
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and d artagnan and advanced toward the door   120.38445778094044
then after a time they disappeared   57.025597457893284
nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church   225.8777950572184
porthos foresaw that if d artagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed   127.61724255328795
and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times   78.92718420261535
well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me   61.85551124115658
demanded she of milady   95.56883652418594
have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur d herblay   153.33237219898868
well marquis said monte cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you   103.38681075279018
pay and eat   154.67358384798936
and if the worthy broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest i should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks   22.606989324231435
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done   126.37588449941792
then they looked at one another   47.151835866444316
they then went down to the thames   139.7991298334321
will the place royale suit you   134.04029154716486
she extended her hands to him with a smile   185.6496253129655
which is to recover a lost and adored son   110.34956200311065
pity albert also maximilian   98.96445576228496
then i believe you   123.30145238217739
she went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre   227.40062362221758
a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air   153.4901672798761
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here   112.57298743854143
chapter 43   71.63617479014631
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it   56.12312974515646
and that   107.39307974908994
monseigneur your eminence has ill understood my words   40.34286122715855
on seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you   160.00273555543623
and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire   106.56595743960567
morrel in his turn took monte cristo s hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was   112.30624284513094
he continued can i have been following a false path   179.61642541748748
here i am smiled porthos with his sublime composure   130.37030722995377
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant   218.8756178400959
come then i see that i must trust unreservedly to you   17.174032687167
morrel he said   159.66475321347824
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman   125.51302802046305
but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet   106.41723537341005
to the world s end   58.44461687389541
at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory   168.41603865191968
so it is agreed and if porthos makes no objection i said porthos i will do whatever you please   118.51658126014195
oh no not at all vicomte athos replied   115.74237856277276
thought d artagnan the man i am warned against by athos   268.5167180822359
but what is to be done   182.35600144155245
but you are unable to oppose them you whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself   118.1727560346106
the young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the owner   52.58968975759499
well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something   129.97976742736557
is the king of the spaniards never had a penny in his pocket   82.06603792558906
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted   97.02648847872402
pass on replied the guard   168.52032161320807
another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving   51.845363455178216
but if he had escaped   178.7822597072367
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn   77.98909420890593
june and july were the terrible months with athos   69.1191194922097
oh selfish man   152.45490239100482
my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de saint méran will leave me as much and m   149.988586529076
is she not free to love whomsoever she will   76.20612723731819
said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial love   58.95010348339767
beware young man   122.66890310812313
you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied   117.16259554407556
his majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day   95.1800943137911
laughingly he said to the councillor restored to his family do you think father that if now i should ask for a company the queen would give it to me   24.45057302618008
whatever may ensue i will go   142.5827524584077
ah you see danglars said caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is   94.09731693912909
felton remained in the corridor   172.62305655375394
but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle   127.15298975579975
he had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by enchantment   134.44567340240624
about five o clock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting   162.97446859975292
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner   69.66338667604717
but this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by a still greater grief   183.4789334578834
if anyone wishes to stop us i will show monsieur de tréville s letter and you will show your leaves of absence   99.9755188819844
what will you   139.09079498379037
i deliver you up to buckingham   173.21294599590792
and i have not seen him   120.99329636132828
they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor   139.6137721195441
julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal roses   142.15389130219643
well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at porto ferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived   121.2107645684097
sign my lord and he gave him a pen   97.55657618054586
she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch   144.85872249266893
did you bring it to your master directly it was made   83.85396629516738
dantès blushed   92.49137583484436
the two ladies entered the drawing room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication   43.46075675807526
don t forget the signal jesus seigneur   170.34162812829433
no no said he   64.47076700402626
you insist on my contradicting the article relating to general fernand an article with which i assure you on my word of honor i had nothing whatever to do   111.23915505212989
said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow   142.66964656727464
the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary   134.21390747286745
he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him   91.12688569514063
you have some in the house have you not   224.42021069387698
i will agree to neither one nor the other replied the young soldier   64.84727912247584
and i know one down there behind the saint nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it   130.87592382063556
valentine was expecting him   107.49550957855766
it must be worth one s while to stoop andrea when that good m   76.88718138113602
but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our place cry down with mazarin   189.31570537997763
but at length d artagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick   103.84647462459215
you have purchased it dearly enough   39.81261730041756
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man   177.85903606133408
the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church   75.29064654573438
i remained in my ignorance and the count of spada in his poverty   91.08455255839513
god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets   101.40879250791787
you are right my lord duke answered the officer   232.82815098275103
and if i am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for i have no future to look forward to   89.81191939642966
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied monte cristo   147.65384296342987
asked mousqueton rather uneasy   100.51927284780241
though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping alone   112.78139599113479
this then continued aramis was my first opinion   100.29045050354569
then the news i brought you is of value   99.07461538705536
formerly replied bazin aramis was his name of perdition   121.6358351995254
never fear these people owe us no grudge   150.85996868704055
what can we do   118.24300793636257
asked louvieres   149.33837226479142
de villefort s door and the coffin removed into it from the post wagon   147.89867525720769
gladly said albert   133.98876472337622
why much the same story   50.25344725055352
many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations   96.37250677090498
there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father s death which had hitherto been a mystery   78.94690189278175
i left it in the pantry because i was called away   146.93981865407892
cried felton i can understand you now   187.8568606496989
yes it is one of milady s bastards   115.63211690706449
the little boat bounded over the waves like a nut shell   101.2189755134358
5 where lord wilmore lived   151.8607503696899
marie michon and what dream does she mean   99.25099596888988
d artagnan remember this   57.746844937390414
i will find the means myself   122.46375611597762
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia   143.40590151661155
certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance   61.756574132132755
his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul   88.67389294946345
one moment i beg for here are the chevalier d herblay and the comte de la fere just arrived from london and they can give you as eye witnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal sister   86.36179744208339
only imagine what happiness that would afford me   181.53723009480805
it was indeed a glorious time   120.38990767632937
but where is the doctor   134.29941846170206
early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker   151.53518924783828
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people   285.0949656464962
pardieu returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude   115.81514146168641
teresa alone ruled by a look a word a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the hand of a woman and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken but could never have been bended   109.71331947528627
the appetite grows by what it feeds on said caderousse grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling   77.53088777792959
hasty actions are generally bad ones   127.34402699410275
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried d artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other   111.68986042353896
perhaps i shall be but at present unfortunately i am not   69.6163789411635
that most sacred in the world said athos   103.13663925021389
here my lords   193.68422670214215
well for my part i a bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to a scaffold in order to have a better view of the king s execution i remain   124.97335901866919
thought he   44.95728106733522
i was brought here by night so devil take me if i know where i am   171.88245966665815
caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time   188.2357658395693
he put out his hand to remove the object   144.21581570827772
to athos to a man double his age   117.2735931898687
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened   138.4816452616585
then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us   130.7664623419675
sir said valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass   211.76437236344114
oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object it is especially when night comes on and when i have to cross a river that this terror which i have been unable to conquer comes upon me   151.47246740165747
adieu madame replied the king s attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door   72.21208905687067
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès   52.737434815948255
he is rich then   64.9921216868791
i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from yanina   72.15751270936659
bah said debray   36.266434610968204
those studs which the king speaks of you gave them to the duke of buckingham did you not   111.47206637672024
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation   51.2988066739096
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain   80.19174557012275
be seated   78.6525912856048
at this moment ali entered   143.54755827758504
and if i refuse to retract you wish to fight do you   112.29910816412759
this island was always had been and still is completely deserted   76.75545756703615
debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave   164.93159736605674
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood   29.250057065615223
come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed   143.656104371537
de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death   76.48415126921208
on the 20th of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month and that morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk emmanuel and his cashier cocles to meet the creditors   219.3026188118626
the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed   122.40357707154807
as our house is carried on very regularly and we make out our bills every week at the end of eight days we presented our account   91.52815854858217
your father s name so well known in italy and so highly honored   140.99391888151592
let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the comte de la fere said d artagnan   127.5539760102784
come answer frankly   184.19386898932453
i have not seen you consequently i know nothing of your dinner   65.7925126602745
and seeing that m   103.52876922880954
the hotel de vendome was not less guarded than the hotel de bouillon and presented as warlike an appearance   30.58435768102302
at six in the evening the guests began to come   157.50209910530802
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they don t wish to let out   73.23418882490554
dantès had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirty six pound shot tied to his feet   146.55880279833693
my political opinions   130.0370745496554
albert remained silent and wrapped in thought   10.52618850889479
here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host   135.82172178593544
he ran towards her   0.48690128619924167
are you mad emmanuel   193.80835004373284
you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris   193.30189101990482
what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty   153.09357004211193
the bars were filled with drinkers   73.81458439785845
26   158.7902326415974
her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing   133.79382592358073
the house of morrel son chapter 30   37.221530444564166
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum   126.67484735714453
i have another name madame i am called athos   129.3034719989543
the chevalier   151.2714539422501
but now it is different   101.79063045305033
she it is whom you see here   103.87587052343038
we will cross the tyne reach scotland and you will be saved   77.6239729512326
of ali tepelini   72.56070020378539
i will assist you with all my heart monseigneur   73.10323038163921
and as it is three months since you have been here and though distracted as you must be in your important occupations you have forgotten to pay me my rent as i say i have not tormented you a single instant i thought you would appreciate my delicacy   139.5276911737057
he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago   109.33035127500413
exordium repeated the curate for the sake of saying something   141.94144494075425
villefort retired to his study and d avrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the dead   80.81901183132298
he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd   141.14502308404116
and if it did not how wretched we should be   74.80522225389853
it will make a little change   185.01501552329728
no said the novice but of my devotion of a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still   77.43536994235959
what an appetite you used to have   129.42279409351968
he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as i am i seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors   165.30308280834777
and he oh he   94.01835809546499
ratonneau and pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the château d if but ratonneau and pomègue are inhabited as is also the islet of daume   69.51916452896131
by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door   103.25083912935375
besides with these men s clothes will you dress here   130.64120698197965
d épinay and himself and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off   149.7321745386926
since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman   137.60256571780985
that he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he appears   132.98921096291824
cried danglars we are not returning to rome   115.1367273429278
since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women   140.3609686517216
four thousand nine hundred and ninety eight louis said peppino   132.24059309539976
do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend   168.03055978158304
it is so indeed   80.90814113727721
oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered la carconte with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took   44.424375590735096
because you are robbed by your steward   171.26683693398772
i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo   67.99027288573501
the other was in a feminine hand long and crossed   158.63709460618276
now i belong to this last named class   121.60512106025125
nothing more than natural   123.0206922364032
let us be off gentlemen let us be off   69.49880340674456
my dear la ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless compliments   139.1757400184726
he shed the blood of strafford   59.02167128884843
it is nothing it is nothing   171.68202812592762
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask   121.5389340488534
are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves   166.10875926661004
these three windows were in madame de saint méran s room   70.0482257121009
clemency is a royal virtue   151.71369062629037
the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself   182.79611817648026
but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his eminence particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments   115.80594495075066
is the king wounded   90.17410610362808
d avrigny or without speaking to the procureur   97.19374460531873
madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm   128.92002827450784
nothing is so catching as confidence   170.75217991026412
and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing   174.38377974502998
d artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal   75.36076438825201
he is a wise man according to his own showing   127.68343696653253
from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons and assassinations in the lower   203.12849321665465
one of my dearest friends   137.12926997775756
and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge   116.18632838833506
he had an excuse for not eating any more   114.95872351946156
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man   2.793480978902778
bonacieux in morning costume standing at his threshold   115.3005719673263
listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other   124.10806260883622
he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck   118.79453112870314
wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket   141.0060026361269
then they must put horses to mine   109.96104424737975
i knew it from the fountain head from planchet   44.36926156475978
continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now   89.93725385298339
the treasure chapter 19   56.18912956711565
at the second he reminded her that he loved her   102.93317240918415
well then assume a cheerful manner as i do   115.85527923063803
a peer of france   52.098845160789615
the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it   28.3566903502345
still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hands of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat   136.54025969264487
now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of may at the same hour in the forenoon   131.86316536368935
de saint méran i applied my smelling salts   201.3898047569879
truly this is an indignity   144.85112471921462
instead of performing your part of this contract as i performed mine you bought me from the scotch cheaply i know and that does honor to the economic talent of your government   120.06415604737722
besides you are neither of you now your own masters   160.21862078425335
i will answer for him   63.487802932330105
everything lies in the execution   76.45088266847121
he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him   103.68622330852716
and why was i arrested   181.74295913363835
she was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of alabaster   82.81007457252232
i can answer only for myself said mazarin   140.7533940226678
franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper   135.12224919672022
sir he said i can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty   170.3698426274799
you will deliver this letter to milady   123.99269845250124
and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time   109.18314775808538
what you scoundrel   127.87063459971077
franz said no more   13.010276019271316
there are your horses   136.03378385799894
but from this moment until then let us not tempt providence let us not see each other   196.9278262438341
felton has not told him said milady to herself   252.56607532555543
exclaimed danglars they have drawn on me for 200 000 francs   117.09631917318164
you have spurs   166.09982176714792
my life has been passed on the high road   114.18561548898109
for myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors i should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as i am obliged to give you up dead or alive   88.81512505855585
grimaud rose and obeyed   88.60243938731043
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity   82.46785750711919
but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and i can not accept your offer   125.29211576490239
then when they had disappeared he said with a smile tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion   142.7383132694664
the point aimed at by every poniard   85.38438774846622
morcerf smiled   105.5622706262854
still if athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck   90.57007403751808
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in d artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected   66.78462495960133
very good resumed danglars   69.96125614696525
ten minutes after we struck our top sails and scudded under bare poles   114.5658003768119
his plan is very simple   140.56603715930964
towards the louvres   102.93315279624379
vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone   123.14802198733096
but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have related   138.33107043674
well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left i succeeded i did in making them all begin with the same foot and i was made lieutenant on the spot   62.937162868419925
don t you see my brave felton   93.4587216647191
blond   123.06516919705889
i will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he is   86.34277779351252
just the very way not to know   293.4796374581941
he was attacked with apoplexy and i was called in too late   110.77402098627005
scoundrel infamous scoundrel   121.73975836693087
cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the banker s house   179.9200299776122
said the duke this is a bad day or rather a bad night to be out late   145.7179756168866
i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something   69.53367670415288
d avrigny himself   109.80607087661156
no one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad   126.18904200777746
the stock is in your own hands   98.2214021622859
it must have been a mistake   42.81642438316351
there are words which close a conversation with an iron door   91.39189662975926
mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its execution   147.89133515566004
but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life   142.3270102868682
beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight   212.13208386969546
and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place nor their battles afterward without the purse more or less furnished which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow   94.90767193225463
yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heart one can only love once and did you ever see her again   163.94707596366763
consequently valentine came up to noirtier on leaving madame de saint méran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep   150.37764743797902
i retained my harness by instinct   75.50056137133609
therefore let us separate   117.68343285071717
who was it you were talking with over there   103.27235101353166
while i watched the window he guarded the door   55.99211708292257
shall we watch by the corpse   111.96942788832233
as to the yard you may do what you please with it   131.37618287347928
but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him   189.54638597013934
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness   116.23766964644743
this is how i transact business said danglars   90.49880804295158
i will slay you   203.94112055996123
that was a noble example to follow monsieur   184.67907213782578
he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked it   72.7642473105067
i had but one thought and that was that he was observing me   171.81083471906103
it was then that he told me two cavaliers of the parisian army were seeking me and named the comte de la fere   34.09179438439752
the deed if you please mr   85.77873036012406
monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence   215.5062765238938
i have his letters said she   86.81031100505518
i will go said the monk   113.76385436372976
de tréville on leaving the residence of the lieutenant criminel and the governor of fort l evêque without being able to find athos arrived at the palace   137.8279180856437
that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans   133.54931506129319
but do you think we shall find the count at home   106.48083980583623
immediately and according to custom the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators   112.7789009754076
bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to him   115.12453821659075
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses   131.40124074200511
a prisoner repeated porthos quite dejected   137.01468003067893
i saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when i breakfasted with the count   129.82084687538742
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from her   64.80331037389702
a man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me   144.3834634007774
now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and chambertin wine instead of macon   83.77563937035733
while at a sign from edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable   192.0104230660641
i heard your voice up to the last moment   145.82414423070827
but wine was wanting the bottle was empty   64.70878538635714
what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly concealed   52.3096429500836
it is indeed the bagdad and bassora of the thousand and one nights   117.67287481836388
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy   106.0579369125673
it is well said monte cristo   149.03000383798258
scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly   82.82178839043
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one   126.609713521271
by her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued d artagnan looking intently at athos   53.76549509223738
they found athos in profound despondency   143.35569476406747
but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber   30.667963211282526
that is all i had to say to you   95.63023892433512
marie michon was a very aristocratic person   138.61045852555347
i am no swordsman   129.32979128159732
he sat down and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him   99.40245111633267
it was a tolerably fine winter s day and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison   84.20150481749175
there is not much time lost yet   64.54292649567378
he told me your life was his and i have promised him that you shall live   167.44994764456442
chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it   10.762749169565723
d artagnan to be preparing his exordium   10.94396523157289
and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted   76.94287921849097
sir replied mordaunt i have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging   104.00933820023046
it seems nevertheless come gentlemen come   134.97864265557297
here it is said aramis with a little look of diffidence which however was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes et qui trainez des jours infortunés tous vos malheurs se verront terminés quand à dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes vous qui pleurez   43.756963090080745
you have seen m   61.794327407150305
shall i give you the change my officer   151.9090039949881
then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again   140.34998589086737
when they reached the street aramis said well athos what do you think   158.10166658640273
i shall never forget it replied d artagnan   142.49920377785784
then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice   81.93805841005224
the blade was red for the blood had become rust   90.39788892608064
i hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend   83.44977158380486
athos and aramis looked at each other   70.36268838358845
i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here i am   132.8840760855773
he lost all together with twenty five pistoles for which he had given his word   131.93844583787387
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him   114.28948067395366
athos and porthos dragged me into this to occupy me   201.44810489124154
no said felton   58.84985149213401
revels in it   154.11815879373643
should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the pharaon   174.59533758971483
then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy man   170.53728563945162
all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement   124.6804863493766
faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him   118.01700144429805
and the duke   151.68800845736385
there is the other replied the queen   96.76048443183397
unluckily as i was then in bearn on account of my father s death the letter followed me there   100.46655774532348
why did you not think of me ungrateful man   64.40925510054997
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical   95.2016027315755
ah you do not know with what i am threatened   125.26703371213023
chapter 113   113.1088818603153
at last his patience was exhausted   64.9364289165
swords then   175.5903519174367
de morcerf went out about half an hour ago   155.89258314725166
but d artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her   137.12862168190932
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousse s letter   141.36778605931505
ah my dear m   23.326112690584807
why does the boat go so fast   19.735075331139086
we got separated in the crowd and i could not find him again   119.25265205324105
but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say   145.30769323189614
now monsieur porthos once more and this is the last   149.47415354836824
by a rapid movement which the gendarme s practiced eye had perceived dantès sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea   141.63535757532532
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other   93.07466153850433
said he with slight emotion   96.5235844023138
what would you do   56.35575071406223
mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed   126.63918125100545
the gascons are the scots of france   135.6363428360371
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church   84.53468501198182
exclaimed caderousse   53.43687654930132
it is then the cardinal s custom to walk in his orangery   133.25257951904757
you forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms   169.65165757824923
a proof of great humility or great pride said monte cristo   123.9566662168643
what am i to do madame   92.11779462300638
for my father   87.79280452880303
ah said the count watching andrea s countenance i do not demand any confession from you   115.05613023394491
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villefort s   64.78217811523102
but one person only wrote   124.63045458862783
monsieur porthos was six feet high   103.06115072769472
this is the order he said   99.87094892971369
but what s that to us   153.37106119486918
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect   121.84712382662416
oh how charitable kind and good you are   53.2590042483593
but continued m   228.99150164874038
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund   195.82484822564612
haydée chapter 78   141.8425225704406
he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby   74.17835488117242
but i want to know in what way m   190.15349583967563
well this route is impossible   78.21591737818179
all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand   66.97852085104282
no louise no   185.70546383501346
no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos   109.24236964284836
no but franz has   131.97117791474184
the papers said something about it did they not   113.8914411607028
count she said bragelonne must be a charming place   110.0924247804668
and your princely father is he rich very rich   100.91504029441619
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired   142.3059919805962
a quarrel and what for gentlemen   39.79736470834963
morrel was leaning against one of these mechanically fixing his eyes on the graves   115.89461522686886
above the king there is god   170.74822561528018
for form s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named   47.109246309456964
you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed   68.79132310448398
the unknown would not name anybody and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself known   121.67660076578815
she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtier s eyes   117.1275996426829
morrel here is the pharaon without a captain   95.27969174570401
d avrigny cried she in a stifled voice   173.89724631573165
i can only promise to examine into your case   111.6351512248897
in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day   126.69982257983244
let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you   103.8693807478764
cried the king he a boy   95.8479813098448
impossible impossible   131.21230994307086
how strange continued the king with some asperity   123.15115205362564
ah no joking viscount if you please   101.72709012425436
here are two english gentlemen just arrived   86.62903886526304
answer then   179.31838514804014
no for he has gone again   163.18470728124842
you destroy everything   62.0038227649579
by degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars   164.06770411682112
noirtier who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the dagger m   100.86106598589735
athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room   113.7173270706306
spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will   91.14631347387564
you will bring him then   57.77898295567527
has the ministry resigned   111.32361709784841
i can not have deceived myself he said   141.58453145430212
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand   131.95641627202278
look at aramis now   158.12993317305242
nevertheless rapid as the movement had been d artagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man   164.8896154088563
if i had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality   172.25085162331737
they have closed up the grating with a board   162.60693798056712
you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor   180.32248085125207
d artagnan bent down to his horse s neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat   107.16508185565085
the daughter of m   131.57558056885762
the general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported   116.50522637092755
it is not aramis   37.95074868652273
you would have caused him an access of his disease   128.80015732352422
and this marriage broken off without a reason being assigned yes it is all from the same cause   106.35708357402707
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des catalans   46.72207095778285
tis a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur l abbé is repeating to me   188.95786195270398
but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle   190.39056890707673
monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever i am king sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our side   155.40672702466753
and so people talked of something else   31.767226387446527
whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him   173.47033714323197
because then i have no responsibility   131.6053599540353
how many men does your eminence wish to escort you   139.73464714397898
said mazarin to himself what a sweet face   155.75058482120272
very ill replied the wounded man   80.88525357221425
d artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone   151.5596601782213
30 in the avenue des champs élysées   96.22640373246661
i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him   133.39680465640524
the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked   161.23544757858062
he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pocket handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu   121.25955688337085
but when it concerns your majesty s service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count   118.61217103027117
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point   170.9618101542159
from you   134.30835547909743
i don t ask porthos   223.56203981557894
the jest however soon appeared to become earnest   115.20274670798739
she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you   81.94366894223143
yes yesterday   69.48027938264897
you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not   98.77138999130759
by whom did the queen send you this jewel   93.08052572200585
it was planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of piedmont   127.36161226015507
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of d artagnan and porthos   117.83141669941787
at their ball   32.56488782142394
bonacieux whom d artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him   123.78681433045428
some wine   78.76028448335484
valentine had not seen him   48.17536994338124
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping   66.883161281196
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father   98.33904701495926
and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes   38.73199658147064
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury   182.75565471418747
for if i remember you told me you only expected two persons albert   154.72450308914316
40042m the same deadly silence succeeded these words   5.040701205589997
write that name on a bit of paper lest i should forget it   142.50219116845045
give it to me said the duke   97.3602741881517
you mean to say that he betrays me   73.9394993992963
a tear which appeared in the old man s eye expressed his thanks to the doctor   153.0210694983449
he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest   113.3052228874324
you say she is in a convent   20.085002814214974
only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of   150.94208950187522
madame de bois tracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces i believe for a trustworthy maid   150.4548791411631
i know what you mean   106.19329568350682
and what will he promise us   70.50164305189115
yes we are young   126.0359063391629
and who affirmed as i said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it came   67.98881051318574
give grimaud time to clear away the breakfast   141.88459038341998
but however all other feelings may be withered in a woman s nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love   114.85716774145696
ah said he i hear a human voice   131.87103377835936
when you can not do so it is indiscreet   164.39127726035636
and a little bit of a thief   84.51285073729106
they are spanish smugglers said he   189.2955755673578
i thought he was up to something   122.75260337170039
not the least noise was to be heard   135.99704704203307
and when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword   150.05876471700296
full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape   56.399271415299225
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercédès   167.63953605427483
de morcerf s who is deceased   113.36041180074291
the side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross   189.79003781119724
he has killed the executioner of bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged   94.98949297900536
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips   182.88154933382577
why i have related the events to you   74.15410884476725
as for aramis of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the character a character which like that of his companions we shall be able to follow in its development his lackey was called bazin   165.92982743060227
and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle   170.64538899294666
pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please   105.98346309410633
review your life albert   86.31046270944206
my carriage is at the door madame and i must be in rome in five days   132.8330009800738
what are you eating there porthos   57.884585449236376
because he is the brother of coligny   38.94166635223321
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercédès and his father could have joined him   56.818872326409696
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time   188.26720783729075
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested   87.90372222116831
or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed   47.20564783770064
he ejaculated italian   87.78519335434527
where am i   131.16675480445193
and me too monsieur said blaisois   156.57537283046761
in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated   64.8738238322234
has mankind treated me as a brother   136.9719090919495
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three   70.85906747942879
well you the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility   120.20236665416516
then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met d artagnan who having seen all was coming to him   111.64330662984847
no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife   28.120387191736754
well my faith   141.22405616839967
this smile appeared to d artagnan to be of bad augury   36.05619693831129
well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the baroness   91.8197577955259
he was petted tended cured   92.71629748876227
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule d artagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain l auxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy   111.48700067590018
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor   112.92085003772286
i shall wait for you here till seven   187.49004368297088
he flew then rather than walked toward the convent of the carmes déchaussés or rather deschaux as it was called at that period a sort of building without a window surrounded by barren fields an accessory to the preaux clercs and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose   84.0300606510564
from the death of the late king till the young one came of age without reckoning wars and sieges seven times   174.4348572972998
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room   120.9506052747331
let us not even here speak thus of him   72.00706049470799
said he to him   94.04197675410482
de tréville s tone of voice that he was very angry about something   142.08355146616498
those who have read the memoirs of mme   120.16934746045095
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom   133.2394887299501
and will it be the first time you have ever been there dantès   209.03000146164453
you wore a close ruff a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe and in that cap a heron s feather   67.42713848229013
morrel i shall have his place   168.29101826816287
it was only a precaution   197.30932654196755
adieu my charmer   203.95086781657156
if my vote and interest can obtain it for him i will readily give him the one and promise the other   123.01756816603535
d artagnan signed to them to draw near   73.44375802104224
oh merciful heavens was i not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility by my contempt for him not remembering or not willing to remember that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer   188.24576870972075
i ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people   49.367158430014015
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos   40.090785705851076
despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air   141.65244866405573
but d artagnan had now slipped through the window   209.34666162426726
what brief   117.6451932788985
i don t think they can be in need of any   129.89165203409627
how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones as he ascended to give him foothold   43.147323339181895
this was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board   74.58866271095016
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead   124.73448616144593
no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why   123.96210308262675
athos dwelt in the rue férou within two steps of the luxembourg   136.961367518382
at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log   110.1456583295675
the man we are seeking   123.15555711097105
asked d artagnan uneasily   33.27692111548558
asked morrel after he had read it   217.11128168409869
but as i maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed d artagnan could not restrain a smile   118.00473371910259
mousqueton said d artagnan you must render me a service   167.4961081208114
30223m ah yes said monte cristo smiling   82.00878720855641
lord de winter was not at home   136.83397514208835
and were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united   67.99068735815334
but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace   41.155122495197276
i am lord de winter baron sheffield   111.05915508672616
she is not his wife yet as it seems to me   70.9917790472908
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina   109.243039688958
and did you convey this answer to your guest   113.82628918853113
she learned drawing music everything   68.54437182544689
maximilian and emmanuel looked at each other   123.35586183961281
arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and dismal   127.7941536689346
the three blows were scarcely struck when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter   91.35844167307015
only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen   138.89938055441752
i know you to be a man of resolution   97.79354551290393
it was the governor who hearing of faria s illness from the jailer had come in person to see him   73.63355526042588
d artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of dionysius spread a carpet on the floor went upon his knees and made a sign to mme   175.58539639024104
well this time athos said d artagnan upon my word you are mad   150.70488444136208
are there any fresh instructions   138.57625447513675
along the wall sir said mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves   219.81452973789828
such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these   207.20471172524526
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation   167.20116527439734
i avenge myself   155.6378778270136
come in come in said albert rising and advancing to meet the young man   126.24487825728616
when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box   54.6584389591532
the pavilion chapter xxv   104.97397470515011
the indictment the judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence   85.21229490890714
but there are oubliettes   75.55562819703984
what horse dost thou choose for thyself   118.69992555672599
besides are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud mousqueton and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos porthos and aramis   82.31128119119742
he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men ill disposed to allow themselves to be taken   98.25818172647479
you may understand that the moment has come for me to re enter the bosom of the church   155.19258101668805
evidently he did not understand his meaning   116.58016485002527
well try the hotel de luynes raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you   107.63860099481086
if there really has been a crime we will investigate it   107.11836240701146
poor dear girl   156.72601670848135
the best   142.54388598479636
it does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which athos had started it does not signify gentlemen   68.50482894963835
in execution   62.68911788406306
now pass your arm through this opening   179.4764587873392
one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were sitting   89.41168420562477
oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies   177.6853885709866
in my opinion a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle danglars broken contract and m   51.61072423732616
the matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated   124.575062013889
thought porthos as he walked away it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenard s strongbox at last   71.93957952287316
i told her my orders from m   99.93087032524014
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror   62.655906918760195
chapter 54   53.63126161446161
the gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they seated themselves   28.342458295233754
then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur   120.15504977450242
oh yes more than once but always in vain   180.60836528039712
am i deceived   94.82962955749508
gentlemen said de winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at paris let us separate to avoid suspicion   88.81100458824363
monsieur le prince   30.745921755428043
that gentleman your friend defended himself desperately   94.19797709872057
i will summon him hither   199.11268287600382
the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said danglars   115.55294997364464
at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound   87.73992294876807
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke   84.44437787174635
she had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much noise   109.48208682381221
exclaimed lord leven   142.22968151426335
and i can almost say that with my own ears i have heard the clauses of the treaty debated   97.15911920503049
things take a different name and the vulgar do not follow them that is all   109.1836880639512
i shall get nothing from these fools he muttered   149.4174307184877
if it should even compromise me a little said monsieur de comminges with a smile still make your demand   117.31705580141713
tire to him   173.684440617893
and i charmed it away   77.65422465971784
think of it sire   117.12827676561544
only a letter all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters had come for aramis   86.33212375730389
he is alone   183.88241012712956
what a dire misfortune   122.92582438985052
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us   119.44228043824059
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside   207.60076315776195
felton remained behind   123.56945299151558
cried villefort in a contemptuous voice   176.26490364869014
there were only chimeras and illusions   64.06575916528192
you will find yesterday s report of the minister of police   135.89744059125445
but if a large fortune produces happiness danglars is happy   113.89994386943313
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee   120.2851252384861
then some verses to compose which madame d aiguillon begged of me   73.22639526933764
come come said the old man be comforted my poor child   108.92905403550347
i waited your orders said d artagnan crossing swords   161.13756048124364
said mazarin and when has rueil been a prison   120.15466164609317
gentlemen thus d artagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him   162.2993499685799
i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune   199.31651231627603
oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm   71.20835652016194
and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve   101.80095599244414
therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans   123.88152150471036
i recollect   141.76962505656235
nevertheless one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away   108.10633317185717
we must never look for discretion in first love   117.00728826060649
the novice seeing milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior   70.37337310531183
who told you of it   44.06392585450401
by the light of one of these torches d artagnan perceived men in uniform   111.22453013726988
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection   49.05255980284183
that is the name of your true executioner   151.8624029895522
four hundred   218.63764510207375
scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair   137.37402462999097
porthos and aramis looked at each other and grew pale   56.65471290269838
and supposing you had succeeded   91.75864549463199
you have my word   184.2622114429618
de villefort notwithstanding his self control was visibly affected and when monte cristo touched his hand he felt it tremble   32.36219123285615
as to the king he made no demonstration of politeness only stopping before the queen   139.10459103671204
rochefort trembled in every limb at this question   194.92108596332162
for heaven s sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere   194.1974922329968
the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815   69.15340235440539
he is one of my friends   154.3587981091675
it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime   133.90110767149366
tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him   214.7432252076139
franz was less enthusiastic   47.41678057110704
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment   69.61858638582886
he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present   124.7175476895528
upon a word from her i would betray my country i would betray my king i would betray my god   52.70817589901793
he shall be tried said the cardinal   82.00485769639286
swear to be mute   49.434020013088926
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion   51.20570544758793
the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa eugénie sat near her and cavalcanti was standing   16.437152173739562
if he only remains here a fortnight and pays for what he drinks i shall soon re establish my business   60.58610761365592
cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand for he began to lose his strength with his blood   119.80393476877181
bonacieux which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of aramis   155.4471935064254
where is fernand   136.31059809787592
and then besides the useless blood   183.92287898533155
i have known that said the queen a long time   106.53548378015586
we no longer know anyone madame   66.36695464366542
i shall have further need of him   218.98670061087844
de boville who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left   45.39623484927202
then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper   168.8782627967384
in the third edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass   60.39884900717447
but i have never been presented   137.2119398358661
this raillery exasperated jussac   178.82814765842633
he had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the bone   84.6592428682072
well what did he say then   153.88976765105213
he was right   148.8316538450861
the young man was overwhelmed as he read   115.79666963992622
repeated the young girl   94.40834919472975
exclaimed athos to day love is like war the breastplate is becoming useless   191.28452205253797
that child has become a man   72.9569109463234
you do not know what he is about in the cellar   145.3475796593352
fencing boxing and single stick   70.57722016925517
what has become of monseigneur athos   148.31664082194763
i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice   126.70054762792253
oh you know it tell them tell them   88.20762788749857
the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold   142.35753288057413
but who are you then   130.15616395365606
although la rochelle was invested however certain success might appear thanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city the blockade might last a long time yet   41.842177456658845
and whatever might be considering the violent character of milady the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her   135.25888963530994
what are you going to do my friend   85.53811696643676
the interview for which i ask is of us two alone and i very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted   122.19594731116236
no replied mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm   74.3971979704171
here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold   126.1705485143575
and he made a gesture of polite dismissal   247.56191376934456
0071m to be sure   31.348055235779583
her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the accused   144.152864110768
good thought the gascon this is a promising beginning   105.1496436036884
i have a favor to ask of you   207.29080607379473
and i madame replied athos am looking with admiration   130.92409910849736
otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses   21.76712781070512
but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend du vallon who has three   110.65062274927227
morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected   89.39347823143069
sweet child murmured monte cristo   166.81715850485222
bazin remained at the window   98.06300007097032
oh replied he half laughing half serious   159.83291651923395
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend   76.36054513592143
villefort shrugged his shoulders   103.55714867162658
and mordaunt darted out of the general s tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy   176.77689454638937
madame bonacieux was released   113.52763155204683
there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu   129.11419743370277
look gentlemen all   47.25098620936535
whom am i to take with me   121.93320521190354
as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port   153.12650990439832
to the questions which d artagnan put concerning her health she replied bad very bad   87.60283132097985
you see i destroy it   200.24328953518227
john lateran and peppino called rocca priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa and the men of his band   48.64772080086756
monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count   130.82689272432503
monsieur the governor was all astonishment   101.63950155305803
he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door   126.51645176406836
this threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended   119.40766223268014
all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk   36.17503682941761
accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee   145.24384651917518
the matter is gallant   25.630269368888463
as for the count he had fallen on his chair   86.65942233161974
well your majesty said he you see how far my enemies go   43.32472120143605
i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise if i would   18.009171523076333
surely if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon i ought to be forgiven   99.98240708677008
they found the carriage where they had left it   273.233519321097
debray she said   116.23174256238823
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where there s a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table   145.25237039770232
take the diamond then and sell it   125.60451794114132
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given   127.42252657834268
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference   139.0943153583494
noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson   147.59228878616088
happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to one s self and the walls walls have ears but no tongue   162.0915537948797
your interests are concerned in your so doing   142.5653853828869
but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness   175.38456617804914
danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur   36.50526708757417
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone   171.65480624181248
barrois will open the door for you said valentine addressing morrel   88.8924358690112
do you disapprove of this journey my dear m   79.32536935793844
i am inclined to think so   26.628975252318497
at length the long desired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him   107.33176837004656
you have then a repugnance to your profession   143.87433410676456
should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me   61.146559733435055
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak   83.42171014841406
the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside her   109.02502473885212
well shall i send for some breakfast here   109.07401763709422
do you know villefort that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain   96.64830511679122
only i beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long   71.8877401555342
marquise said villefort approaching his future mother in law i request your pardon for thus leaving you   65.82493102783263
but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land   211.28837025391476
to that exclamation of porthos s succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door   235.37361544319708
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door   88.70473600846827
only three days since we looked on him as our best friend   118.40693248378544
the next morning he saw albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle   178.4459797738161
were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper   103.81442220288055
but mme   155.78133761358853
he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved   127.02676146261328
man of talent   217.09974690740728
i will not appear to parley with rebels   65.78982176156552
one is that of edmond dantès lost to me long long since   165.3290592321932
next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the murderer   108.29435050641013
then approaching monte cristo he added especially before young m   118.33322670044046
about seven o clock in the morning they set out   70.9518504831344
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord   87.43211442673073
besides let me own something to you   102.91360033252207
but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me   81.20293029195804
and we mercédès and i should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time   83.49489161263503
then i felt that i was lost   139.21846096240432
took instead of his black cravat a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau   43.74506904273716
leu and followed him instinctively   121.66761835725818
for you don t propose i imagine that i shall kill that man of the church   141.59415633148535
very well madame   180.55842247087264
yes if your majesty releases them   134.2479356569577
i will try to accompany you said aramis though i scarcely feel in a condition to mount on horseback   81.19539514453552
do you refuse   152.98487639840624
dantès rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the château d if   145.70485877565372
i send them but like pilate washing my hands   55.89988174583216
he borrowed this from don quixote the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly remembered   102.67245191433956
i was a witness of the last hours of charles i   145.7475962891444
and yet this letter must be somewhere   106.23765549951342
porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity   146.4453128840292
asked felton in a sharp tone   198.88653565444585
but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller s shop it is another branch of industry paralyzed   132.7230691769799
chapter 64   148.98986078227537
but he sank down again immediately   97.06950654479517
perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it   85.97052847164511
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out   101.92793855455926
resumed athos   153.04117619907797
i own to you that that young man s visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep   76.01064789458368
when she recognized her lover the poor girl extended her arms to him and believed herself safe   155.40265281424968
well said she hardly giving franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven and you are already the best friends in the world   67.35657055641491
where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend s heart and a king s life   103.49419085173645
he repaired therefore immediately to his hôtel and caused himself to be announced   136.93173347290193
but be assured my dear monsieur d artagnan that if i had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than myself   130.33663220820296
go sir count replied d artagnan carelessly   176.85286447412994
the casket would encumber you   121.69581951394228
d artagnan had no time for a prolonged love siege   127.01577341498175
oh sir said raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my exploits i had forgotten   162.43774182896428
submit this honour to somebody else   88.31798652035235
so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now   136.40095917860458
said de guiche   111.64984506355657
and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten   108.59279791021386
villefort to whom marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories sought and obtained the situation of king s procureur at toulouse and a fortnight afterwards he married mademoiselle de saint méran whose father now stood higher at court than ever   139.3088951986617
planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses   51.461543034732955
i didn t understand it all he said but i understand now   163.53085908018437
you will not wait till he asks   130.0996145835457
captivity the fourth day chapter lvi   154.28464447983032
but suppose they come unarmed   78.49563424447253
de monte cristo have you not   117.0390342108233
from every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh   82.85114555392116
haydée chapter 50   211.7620035906005
there s only one remedy dear raoul that is to marry her as a compensation   64.24042158295018
what have you eaten today   125.20800705859327
planchet d artagnan s valet supported his good fortune nobly   87.446589634074
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves   138.74859658018724
he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king s attorney   167.82188201037383
i knew that but i supposed he had returned   111.20687058429951
he was found in your lodging   127.05561095455522
omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street after they departed again   91.39573161902291
you face the insinuations of the pelagians and the semi pelagians   156.51699739476493
as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard   165.08511145436682
and how did a leader of smugglers continued franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa   138.17585270789772
it is late and the governor is asleep   143.62395558108201
your father hates me while your grandfather on the contrary what strange feelings are aroused by politics   73.18166766516399
yes i understand everyone would like capital   120.48614666179378
after which your majesty will i think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf   148.31148710073265
done   93.76388911706529
you must love somebody   143.55997286972917
are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks   112.43118344208123
it was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance   179.52615370877103
oh merciful heavens   129.70101735840296
that is the haven   91.62319004031446
yes like a clap of thunder   141.37948137588268
we must fly said the queen   66.44166237466798
is it you indeed   125.2199398033249
master broussel is being killed   40.08019709125814
ma foi captain replied the sentry i do not know   2.619023373909016
someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains   86.80214997501574
you leaned upon my arm upon this madame   128.2976772914309
have you a name then   88.81087312749847
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward   93.84026049201208
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house   58.407923466198184
the thirty two horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hours   58.18362754792649
this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make my fortune   72.13009017833721
it had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the scottish commander   81.26845729756604
she will soon be softened   90.98128354230366
i have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times   144.51288899683192
absence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were between edmond and mercédès they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone   79.72714702970023
in former days i had not only three friends i had thirty   125.41799796099322
bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of moving   89.50875458195658
for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror   115.62129907507703
leave them said monte cristo   66.58763421549826
cried a shrill voice from the end of the room   179.63677710093975
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty   125.16218435929942
said oliver with a slight curl of his lip i forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid   132.76431001664784
the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks   178.48532375730508
a few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics   132.49712150390582
because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc   104.54967517372235
the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing for a ship s lantern was hung up at the mast head instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore   82.51308572231383
he knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed aside   79.81002116862344
for all this continued milady i should long ago have revenged myself on him if and i don t know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him   109.59472391595048
ah my faith   143.73225812844527
this child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor s orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden   112.21776935444565
every minute athos was forced to restrain d artagnan constantly in advance of the little troop and to beg him to keep in the line which in an instant he again departed from   128.9823658805981
if i am caught i risk nothing but being taken back again to prison   36.027747442069796
there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor   110.1336456392121
oh he would kill me   166.79546997897097
accepted the money   107.17161461331838
it appears so replied monte cristo   78.36525264963703
felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensively   79.68773554326933
no madame said villefort   95.08402916737492
remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said richelieu significantly that it was i who came to seek you and that i did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling you   154.30449928101544
we must put the madman with the madmen   173.02968469548466
again by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris   127.25135898254301
they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you   175.01078377214998
what convent   45.52737540904096
you will give me a copy this evening which i shall know by heart tomorrow   77.45898684572006
a retired baker my poor benedetto is rich he has an annuity   96.22709982002226
but if he should be at home and see me   144.90838619459024
and all these one hundred and ninety one were royalists   44.399212494489035
my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat   138.73045622842204
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy   75.69264411672572
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal   149.25534958628097
she saw nothing   119.48022981520907
angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo   51.38216550985754
athos put his arm around aramis s neck and embraced him   125.04515661154912
now i have found you nothing prevents my being as well dressed as anyone knowing as i do the goodness of your heart   68.80731042330436
i shall expect you returned morrel   123.06367151900395
it is large and there will be no want of room for you all   106.60915960302243
it was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached   5.436117502036282
all is well   138.773472600259
well search my friend search   75.49574400898129
a most dangerous conspirator a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over as he is daring and resolute   112.52533274729836
the letter   62.288344649807925
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks   111.61529521201615
cried the gascon don t threaten   126.42347999546561
and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter   85.2570438659987
de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake   137.12001015940697
describe him to me then   127.33552938552809
on honor   112.98651557405678
you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal   114.38161870439959
i am commissioned to find out my companions and i began by you who were the very soul of our society   84.41567779560569
i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us   92.44894167258025
lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady thinking that as his sister in law employed them they must be the best   77.82230206141367
pardon my frankness dear friend   160.25942113266296
he was stopped by athos   205.19004579166682
twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect   59.94507203569503
decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal   46.10747044353545
she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder   151.24964200412361
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate   121.35013354994895
how would you have me know   15.654905084737052
certes these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged thought the terrified d artagnan and i no doubt with them   129.00666042021663
as to bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw   159.2270197353795
i heard all this from the window for i was anxious that mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment s repose   58.99806030207336
the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared   78.92888185795644
that is to say i had one   165.53030071739653
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed   109.93529720100807
this time d artagnan was not hasty   116.19612947135018
the meeting chapter 91   57.19856923475821
asked d artagnan hesitatingly   101.13435902047456
0057m danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him   147.31213880877084
but i accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine with which they are much pleased   77.38116617193721
and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison   189.46342991457175
he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water   111.39914942595209
leave me here and go and speak to madame de villefort who is trying to attract your attention   123.34058073582892
as regards the generality of mankind it is   94.207509068289
sir replied raoul putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count i owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me   70.96613271505103
and he thrust his hands into his pockets   122.49711411144486
eating what   130.19116982628378
living you would feel shame at my name   172.90340431869998
then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelings i have a son said he and i ought to think of him finding myself among assassins   200.4362483956125
then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads   171.93969511877577
oh if i were to see the plume of his hat the end of his cloak i should know him   40.36054333438872
stop said he   158.58255484279033
replied the cardinal   9.869756356243968
he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto   117.51668364556085
him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity   106.85978425974977
if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady said athos coolly it is useless   68.87790378181177
and you athos you know something of everything and can be our captain   105.92903455165643
this diamond does not come from an enemy monsieur replied d artagnan it comes from the queen   129.99177744023288
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice   157.66606981536995
there ought to be some money in that secretaire   97.95700647224491
possibly said danglars   136.44908860518393
and asked the abbé is m   136.01399545409464
the street was safer for him   130.63211683392495
but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough   131.51354000021908
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son   157.16248580919984
well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clément or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france   60.06350556789025
a shot was fired that moment   160.33995443061463
let us decamp first and you will understand afterward   115.11907756283772
oh let them come in   117.59421272832587
i want to go into master broussel s house captain replied friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of paris know so well how to assume when necessary   22.782500514510915
at twelve the the oh heavens my poor poor child   60.722990520721005
but the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the king s wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them   113.40502178710733
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor   102.3789589363245
replied mazarin   141.37348366777275
grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the cavalcade   131.31872695997362
i have been so these fourteen years   159.7561859583083
de tréville made his entrance triumphantly into the fort l evêque whence he delivered the musketeer whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him   76.07655060459219
indeed beauchamp you are unbearable   146.48660374303697
the man somewhat crest fallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said   155.5812293327081
depend on my care to see that your youth is not blighted or suffered to pass away in ungenial solitude   75.08887679698913
nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos than i have   120.59700524345848
in fact mousqueton had not concealed from his master that he had met d artagnan and aramis and that d artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the béarnese pony upon which he had come to paris and which he had sold for three crowns   238.21885356582828
at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless   63.61331960561416
but you will not follow me   238.1196332466081
why did not i tell you she had been stolen from me   84.6992530572017
de tréville himself returned   175.96905974830065
and in spite of his extraordinary self control there was a strange vibration in the gascon s voice which made his partner start   88.01601254249489
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges   77.12238754649566
for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty   72.26011956227629
i wish to receive her majesty s commands from her own lips   71.42311385350803
pray mind what you say for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart   107.1935993547624
and i mine   110.1079080002136
mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that monte cristo could not restrain a sob   99.58533178380415
no no i would rather die   165.4679677663138
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends   209.56866524739158
ah said caderousse i had promised and you are breaking your promise   60.274383523269435
and does my father mean to remain long in paris   46.315375138905694
but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace france   121.09753321263646
have a care cried porthos to his opponent   91.49249717272238
you see my dear that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party   108.15649054692565
mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile   97.57831398321153
whither would you have me go without friends without money in a part of france with which i am unacquainted and where i have never been before   130.3267465507841
but how did she become so   100.54264462757072
aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop   71.95807573639769
and you said athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter s name   153.91778702022572
ma foi i have called three times without once seeing him   198.57718560131747
comminges had seen rightly and mordaunt had really acted as he had related   57.51094219424088
aramis you certainly are full of wisdom   85.29300765059918
i say so m   68.40652353282789
his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north   108.02876170714951
none on my word   110.46037770010948
i perfectly well remember perugia sir and the hôtel des postes and the festival of which you speak said madame de villefort but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before   200.41561311020772
i was not deceived said he   152.44916870213572
athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure   106.86959320320148
but i can not i am starving   157.6042463370541
willingly answered the soldier   70.85127745224719
prince cavalcanti said the latter   128.06483923025306
in the evening m   111.24238983403872
grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening   125.55705418282683
and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the stones   98.99577536227113
so much the worse said porthos   76.70200788241081
château renaud and morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder   75.12079188243781
then in order to test the capacity of the testator the first notary said turning towards him when an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person   105.97539819908096
what object think you have this expedition to ré and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting   222.31432941078378
yes for mazarin has granted what i desire   133.23166981150163
are you sent by general oliver cromwell the most illustrious captain of the age   79.68028360886908
my officer said athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forgetfulness   195.8792996193891
well go and talk with the boy said d artagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead   57.37661885271642
it is well known how violent the king s prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men   82.8627027280622
yes hither   56.68411725624758
she desired me to give them to you   87.59088292284424
when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race   67.71066745346769
it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation   128.59150870621656
yes repeated the leader in a whisper god bless his majesty   78.95987962036418
and you will tell him i will publish the report of bois robert and the marquis de beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of madame the constable with the queen on the evening madame the constable gave a masquerade   87.68858949939087
sir i shall call my people   77.59475908309881
dandré   150.9102532203192
friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth   129.84676759325194
a passport for embarkation must be obtained   191.28239890294645
in consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillor s door and knocked violently   126.64931293273192
oh you are young while i am beginning to get old   135.37717802545103
this can t last and he drew another twenty from his pocket   124.44623885028784
but i can not be imprisoned for the reason alleged   155.02499252035938
if they meant to execute him at la grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of execution   147.82526113829442
in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dantès did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him   169.47063172040907
the procureur went out after having double locked the door   103.98007988042839
before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived   103.69172739054227
monsieur d arminges said de guiche remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible   104.76191989750298
if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival   148.62793359946548
he told me that he should henceforth recruit his musketeers from among the guards of monsieur the cardinal   137.359708703383
i only supposed it must be seven or eight o clock in the evening for it was in the month of october and it was quite dark   131.49136900135903
he is worse than that he is a devil   105.88613284904538
danglars nodded his head   143.44407587031395
yes i will reduce this rebellious city to ashes   134.77033126143994
and he held out to the concierge the notary s order   96.05160835808937
rochefort you remember him   163.96546845753755
well i can t say i had much choice of going or not going for i was taken to him between two guards   79.07250199509366
the queen do you say   112.18122846964772
two of the studs are wanting there are only ten   119.72986133135545
ordination   109.73039820113459
was he the man that stabbed you   113.97507742181214
among worldly people manner is contagious   161.80788860491074
and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we make   119.53903064275954
you pique my curiosity dear rochefort   68.27585328150623
here is his letter said d artagnan and he presented the note to his comrades   158.2918737195182
didn t i say so   133.58705257849044
like athos he had discovered the stains of blood   126.4576786394493
at your return i will give you a surprise   161.81226302105586
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father   96.73030659581866
since mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you   129.1915657283085
said monte cristo with charming artlessness   119.83141753145688
she was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as raphael was fond of and titian has painted all his magdalens with   255.50203403209406
a great age you mean monsieur porthos   147.59289917069094
and this explains how d artagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne at the hotel de la chevrette   122.20006507406953
of that which i am ready to feel toward you   181.61638149190142
you have my word said he   61.25787234620751
d artagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his agility   91.36520148894215
i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter   112.80227756471234
a great man in his own country added debray   131.08323275060621
and then said aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in god what is the use of thinking of it all   116.55305922968314
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if i had employed it for another purpose i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy   87.57567252955772
so you like it you rogue   138.39411117501936
when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching   127.38329935406067
all quite correct   101.6084917703068
the island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance   99.67200036948618
seven of his eminence s guards placed hors de combat by you four in two days   36.344375886434875
bonacieux could not close his eyes   113.11944376174966
enormous ones answered beauchamp   49.58741063129622
thus all my opinions i will not say public but private are confined to these three sentiments i love my father i respect m   59.091994785700486
so that but for this marriage she would have been your heir   93.47614213446735
but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in   92.16706550953731
no signed the old man   66.47470488879696
let us dispatch said the duke   156.87352964893356
he turned towards porthos and aramis   162.3911971942877
danglars that you are asking so many questions   105.22290722422754
he saw the deputation from the parisians enter it   153.96674385192384
he asked himself if after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire again   95.98748677251697
noirtier closed his right eye   131.18919781116978
the duvil   113.8480742610866
inquired the young man much alarmed   175.24867385589363
he was shown monsieur de chavigny s watch   105.91133736043385
comte de la fere you wish to perish by his hands   102.42175989715018
none whatever replied eugénie   79.81674109414544
but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel   185.5412496930352
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution   68.8522707172551
shall i repeat to you some of my verses   90.21284682666044
i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect   130.45964367400407
30053m i beseech of you maximilian to cease trifling and tell me what you really mean   104.85936843401285
no my lord but he will be answered the guard   160.9203730021652
save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when i may be able to thank you myself   89.46206099822943
it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman   145.97246916464024
the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house   204.55637712069066
the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment   137.51961070645484
i prefer remaining honorably in the capital   88.33093399294091
but the door closed   3.1041354550235525
morrel s wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent   133.14951230791155
he grew thin he now grows fat   170.63706600902188
mademoiselle   150.6913788292225
edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart   130.9628206459854
for that night madame that night you loved me i will swear it   180.88159709720725
i also said aramis   35.60342488081501
how is it that i have never met you at his house   173.7873360962265
it carries me away   126.3205264619822
de busigny   163.8654290174777
and he pointed his gun at d artagnan who was riding toward him at full speed   99.23696280780949
he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrel s petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate that is to say was in villefort s handwriting   245.51785582516143
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people   108.3299205879815
you are in a hurry sir count said d artagnan   187.4851410009656
i shall love you as i loved my father   109.94734061561181
although it is only just beginning did a lovely summer s day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career   150.60564002563953
gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible   110.3189038958471
we shall see   101.13349030808278
accordingly that same evening milady commenced her journey   140.3820307202717
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude   138.6275864198691
then he bowed   123.91549796326464
but at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her mme   68.10773913745204
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso   151.67174806881417
and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle   109.3495009887609
the calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be   169.32425599162306
and against whom   83.15207140015899
it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing room   91.85174343589789
one thing still puzzles me observed dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight   102.44622064228894
if they are penitent said athos let them follow us   105.6491360025054
and they darted on anew   171.9351604174435
one day he miraculously left the prison transformed rich powerful   128.4836293558604
the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied thank you monsieur le curé i accept   100.0777606186969
this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano was the bill of fare   80.60216695940528
they have abducted her monsieur   108.22561382530496
0243m i awoke as the clock was striking six   157.86374949855036
ah in such a case one supposes sister sister said maximilian coming to the count s aid monsieur is quite right   146.23146940947862
but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man   164.0882070364429
and slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the count s hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by monte cristo   92.92920077961455
coquenard recognized her present and could not at first comprehend this restitution   116.89559087528754
it is my favorite wine   115.8864475946715
but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked   115.75742419374915
but there is an innate sympathy between the roman brigand and the roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former   125.33788627514178
it was just two o clock by albert s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing room   145.4614856982341
oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected   129.55125253974634
but that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the boulevard de la madeleine and an income of 50 000 livres   165.96289429003392
d épinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort   52.080825559839894
morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness   92.79068198071282
the police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer   84.3348897807144
it appeared to me such women as i never weep said milady   99.47562944395351
this with my spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month   238.0365864921057
at ten o clock at night his horses took him to the barrier of charenton   134.11435824656786
no but we are going to replied d artagnan pointing to grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground   97.36951603327013
continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity monseigneur replied milady a fair exchange   145.29900816425288
simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of notre dame   142.86356073251196
grief has consumed her said villefort yes grief doctor   32.8676959640287
you know that we who are true christians are forbidden to lie   115.88981894110306
and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and m   98.58232803781642
if i sought your ruin fool i should drag you to the first guard house   61.12233226552457
madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion   128.8688013978349
the carriage however passed on   82.0900726836025
you will come off splendidly at those two exercises   120.30115349854115
i gad   150.29696827467794
how sire   105.29202525931535
that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds   171.52720923909632
two varieties of demons ah cried milady and rochefort together it is you   13.445514791183356
and the steamboat   138.93445894502563
and the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward   34.28903203784242
the unhappy youth has a mother   61.99564833677725
they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill him   95.56322262780594
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other frenchmen were standing pale and menacing   188.6675282103027
one morning the green book was brought to her by the prince de marsillac   122.23091654422555
the fifth of october volume one chapter 1   86.78019388625165
since i have had the honor of being my lord s steward i have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me   115.04550822052248
he showed it me   57.287786325672236
suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed   105.96218774754765
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold   70.79336695530031
de morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society   104.5837221732192
well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond   87.11207788423708
albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume   78.20012781034825
do not be angry we can try it   99.91236615387324
he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinal s hat in my own fashion   97.02987391363641
shall we wait or shall we charge   132.91911975951518
then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber   128.0604617343937
they made him enter this carriage the officer placed himself by his side the door was locked and they were left in a rolling prison   163.11671951057014
i was going about at random inquiring of everybody when i saw you gallop past   4.011577026931064
i understand said monte cristo well acquainted with ali s pantomime   94.66537946272027
i am at your service and still more my servants   97.27319064417077
for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner   110.1507188558358
oh you can give me this without compromising yourself   11.710368764734113
my father knows me replied villefort   146.42011664512847
they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention   176.02695629060918
it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully   68.2850317297557
you spoke of a mission   66.60316777457157
and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew   160.2720756987964
well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another   84.74043336614992
two years   47.18946636960972
do you wish for any further details   197.43731769188352
let us go said he   147.33381060418716
stammered he   81.72037757503693
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards   149.4888376631509
franz to do with it   51.50651625454649
you know how little i require said the old man   129.47326115516356
several men rushed into the chamber   88.31410589435747
the hundred days m   154.2819825239784
and do you know this gentleman monsieur   182.27715477055006
i am come expressly on that account   26.068732317384956
the queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to saint germain   135.09573640268445
monsieur is a gascon   81.37295170966397
it is not at all amusing here   204.67761046033345
i have now to confess to you   94.62652159143373
see what i have written during these two days and nights   137.5272361768708
at the siege of besancon i was in the trenches   146.37800989752895
ah is it you dantès   197.7795904001422
monte cristo smiled imperceptibly   116.89721892432944
both were in shadow and the sybil of cuma herself could not have read them   200.10564805852258
he is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the chamber of peers with a uniform   94.04829945734019
she was no longer there but she had left her new address   58.89202171648481
he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running   84.04257329212759
i have brought away ten or twelve wounded   39.36277522545204
a terrible howling interrupted these reflections of d artagnan and mme   150.2651009118651
mazarin again   65.0361917644466
this major cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then   82.71703971714017
and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations   126.78429951809115
20087m ma foi said franz it would be the easiest thing in the world   49.999222964644574
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again   144.54379339276971
don t you see they are trying to catch your eye   129.20546231795055
then turning toward raoul go monsieur he said   145.9193173949282
monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor   102.54642754657289
may the devil annihilate me if i return thy wish   136.3035968082475
the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule   105.23202714787028
my child returned monte cristo you know full well that whenever we part it will be no fault or wish of mine   74.78828792718804
and when he had finished said trifles only trifles   175.46370969351398
but do not despair   114.1700432190084
the house belonged as the concierge informed your excellency to m   135.6262657191433
had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been shot   71.69877552496871
you will return alone then   68.68547738940057
gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit   137.55195569713658
it is a mixture of excellent opium which i fetched myself from canton in order to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the east that is between the tigris and the euphrates   171.18172637814817
i do not think it likely sir   121.55197975349607
morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger   83.88474911918014
sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant   138.8399130451557
was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa   130.26712733163617
his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal   197.56779414460084
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world   103.6888024290205
let us talk of those if you please   135.48640048060082
she was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted out   134.39816830287862
and had he dared he would like lucius brutus have kissed his mother earth   103.65902190496983
you are pale and agitated   97.4840604084127
that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself   147.51002450161258
chapter 88   81.46395548193848
you madame have only sought to increase your own and i am convinced that you have succeeded   99.56605722661084
she then recited all the letters of the alphabet from a down to n   36.274773241400226
reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence   166.17256520012424
who married the marquis of saint méran s daughter   68.63484399766227
you were going to drink my wine   165.17690425645097
asked d artagnan of planchet as they galloped on   134.52580185818647
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged   107.10720747752869
unquestionably edmond s star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girl he will be captain too and laugh at us all unless a sinister smile passed over danglars lips unless i take a hand in the affair he added   79.65494930487651
why didn t you do it   126.80198192524834
mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace   139.66946585916497
morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of march that is ten or twelve days after napoleon s return   152.6260586250642
but paris   45.7896581006426
20057m maximilian smiled   154.69860995076527
and how was m   176.82142431955157
i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris   108.55513284963584
however recovering my strength and my ideas why said i should that man have carried away the corpse   87.49089454402768
franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano   106.86683633219349
i ll try said the duke   126.38039221113209
and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards his tomb had disappeared and no one could say there sleeps the father you so well loved   141.59099884537304
no i am wrong   137.37022353025995
father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat   123.56479030029804
well said porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation   115.18569285816655
is it not unjust shamefully unjust   33.32005449325034
he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered and said you seem geographically engaged sir   111.22184531948331
and the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold   129.8604233699556
i think i have killed the insolent fellow   64.17363393836757
i must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castle daddy marteau as they called him well   163.12561421605932
shall i accompany you monsieur   80.65797868365759
be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur monk   132.29125918035615
i humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lose   80.58355888503286
de chevreuse who though exiled to tours and believed to be in that city had come to paris remained there five days and outwitted the police the king flew into a furious passion   73.74303733503041
30345m but i do not think so   105.5942040545091
what was the cause of your quarrel   82.91579847411532
20143m and you will probably find your theme ill chosen   159.1402907787986
oh thanks   177.6719165883962
de château renaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all over that is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemart took albert s hand   53.6000284159118
he was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm   154.94147896509304
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise   45.29791209163152
your dinner has been a real feast   166.4436083009401
how happy i am   68.54199197240966
we must go and look for them   137.096167005345
ah let him say now if he does not recognize me   151.49558719623784
but philosophy at half past ten at night is somewhat late   168.16221767824885
d artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times   143.34708550200259
the footman s mission was an easy one   102.53315848702867
go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at midnight   28.985688422248543
as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being used   146.18494431947454
thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her   48.88921846609479
here i have brought mine with me replied albert   72.10447539181966
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered edmond   207.24902294214422
how could this ring come into the hands of milady clarik   65.38146924685172
aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that d artagnan and porthos might enter   124.32615791336029
thus for instance the excellent abbé adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments   120.65220450344572
noirtier m   104.93154926006102
but your house is not m   0.42671218323475557
what an idea   98.66316759246914
to remain silent and dignified in his presence   114.1063341365679
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise   166.93555314962555
well then my dear count present me to your princess   71.8733131351221
monsieur morrel said valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather m   113.06899572843118
her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees   49.07552367382597
d artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm allowed the duke and mme   206.42309606290016
the first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his colleague   187.20564401755752
i know the french as well as if i had made them myself   107.18859540471257
porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to parry s brother he was not nearly so strong as himself   111.50478883826523
now then said andrea while dressing himself i ll wait till he leaves and then i ll slip away   125.23695301535591
i know guitant said mazarin   146.97357698066543
the man made no reply   153.8701993843128
as to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an assortment of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary tools   91.67694191844585
you see that i can not like you for instance settle on any fixed plan   98.94211204701044
said milady i believe so   166.2306689692771
having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the count drawing out his watch said to the attentive nubian it is half past eleven o clock   126.84071460066505
he has neither robbed nor killed nor murdered   53.149323166366315
the felucca is waiting for us you know   63.85434308333512
i do not know replied dantès   119.71258502425327
in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his friend   156.81804428721935
oh do not say so   86.4384635650948
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him   118.84871977490235
is he handsome   221.5822093516761
rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman   134.84003694908392
just this   94.43928975085277
but you general were you not at whitehall   57.93901196626304
but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos   44.68985726823341
i wrote or studied   127.62507672633174
but as you know a corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a day s journey before me who followed him on foot   145.65509610151662
and the five and forty thousand francs inquired caderousse in a hoarse voice where are they   105.93855292258965
d artagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis   68.81529114541283
you are in constant communication with the baron danglars   129.90262165958256
brother in law of the late king your husband the consort of madame henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr   164.77554368860265
shall i help you madame   114.25340749191639
nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn   32.7408838307704
but what s going on in the city yonder   145.95671592917648
will you then kindly tell me if you have in your command the chevalier d artagnan lieutenant in the musketeers   87.30552752562254
the bird on the branch the dog in his kennel the sheep in the field the boats moored in the loire even became alive and vocal   65.03173172775737
i will suppose anything you please   79.7472696428772
you have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the queen   125.90408780109907
my son she said persons in the count s situation have many secret enemies   116.95991560554164
for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him   130.32171511479987
at this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the window   59.31023832099911
it was the telegraph room   186.5607904414174
my nephew is not yet king and you know laporte has told us twenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything   91.34643219777388
buckingham had returned to london   153.25216436744196
take the helm and let us see what you know   110.37417963290625
then that explains all said monte cristo   94.68515433150614
ah they are my scourges   104.09850017077949
sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south   90.32826383609279
do you seriously ask my advice valentine   70.97709288471427
the house with kitchens and cellars below had above the ground floor two stories and attics   115.93257175815921
andrea was supported by two priests   166.72253141630875
well viscount there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling britzka with four post horses in which one may rest as in a bed   151.0052959333434
he desired kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was and that he would be obedient to her orders   79.74180524847856
let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes   123.20400081685617
those clothes are well cut and quite new   113.56270474498002
oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them   91.35985309569712
i shall be baron   76.96452922026245
the count looked at mercédès as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking   272.5045487713778
i told you that yesterday madame made inquiries of me upon the subject   86.74621618198533
d artagnan said athos taking his hand you know i love you   25.166865899271983
and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him   152.0354560091613
i believe by heaven said d artagnan that i shall embrace him since he s upon our road   116.26697591013279
no excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which monte cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude   129.48919723376758
but we have not done with the thing yet   83.81773321453633
when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished   127.55274759088908
he could not believe in such a miracle   102.75125701772589
that is not all resumed lord de winter   131.87555116801278
after some discussion this was agreed to and mousqueton played the role of barber   57.40170705364846
must i receive it or leave it in the hands of the notary   124.3458984687153
cried she smiling   51.63594267262989
at rome things can or can not be done   82.41812157584009
but i could not reach the bolster   139.88422325801855
with pleasure sir   136.12166463499176
it is as i have the honor of telling it to your excellency   160.9944592503315
what are these things   135.8073892163626
your ruin   81.96728832336538
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you   205.78375381976957
all eyes were turned towards athens it was the fashion to pity and support the greeks   113.77025464196238
will she be wanted in any way   20.93960288389701
you saw the emperor then   94.82012536626655
as he gained the top of the rue guénegaud he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him   135.63756091660096
but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling   38.11542542664499
take pity on me then and go   127.55123665639118
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards   81.35336881320804
she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the order signed by the duke of buckingham   66.364486798314
porthos wanted to lengthen out his names mousqueton to cut his short   128.86457355870957
i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue   85.77354477845995
i asked the price   116.09431422146136
not an instant to be lost   148.68144119727708
can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you   111.64469145750607
you have outraged defiled her   108.09030296603848
and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us   117.35188456917392
take something   69.63018955883891
all this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so good natured who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year   110.77395053126996
overturn the world change its character yield to mad ideas be even criminal but live   190.20481710164665
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugénie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty   81.6881439031913
his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines   111.6904511073553
valentine repeated the same voice   88.85723835494295
danglars and tell him that my mother and myself must leave paris tomorrow   82.4089195545036
this woman or rather this apparition for the carriage passed with the rapidity of a vision was mme   167.76974565483266
in short what shall i say to you felton   74.05897633593116
then the news originated at the prefect s last night   78.17031230957707
milady s secret chapter xxxviii   81.47292722231697
why do you take my lord s comb   82.08323735099822
morrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed   35.24442300769317
we had done the business of both admiring the foresight of our poor father who had taken the precaution to bring each of us up in a different religion   91.60164099480536
persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon   36.341532849280924
the writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled   172.2933749560114
the chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of it   202.54788629157315
and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it   120.92879688781491
well then i wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that i have not one of my own and must have one   157.5975537918291
to be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded   128.31650110045356
de saint méran lived at marseilles so that this country house was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the name of the baroness   91.31501412803574
it is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it   55.45013292627882
pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment   136.02141684784837
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated   120.71216062137802
i am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in france   137.3343619697162
yes sire yes it is the same   143.14491220908192
cried aramis and athos what   115.18731486653027
both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about   134.9407894174976
i plainly tell you so replied aramis   115.06245165761914
said d artagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to him   21.25662507484691
aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse   70.21724635024373
aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and athos who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out fire   148.71496439358287
i once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said   75.25197360642757
and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity   44.26907016625343
i was not aware that madame de saint méran was subject to such hallucinations   38.76617763222964
it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of arras   216.39629023401957
what example   115.59005184569475
you are gathering your crop sir   153.17560311284302
what can be done with four   167.2681312189493
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them   64.5466779982028
i shall then have no more friends said the young man   173.78742119811943
fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god   77.47242251287841
this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not a look from monte cristo silenced him   178.8421461166178
assassinate the duke of buckingham or cause him to be assassinated i care very little about that   185.27500841703232
continued the king   126.23180116137561
speak out sir said mordaunt   125.94682768016554
d artagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered mazarin s ante room   45.078136461910105
that one word brings back my mother to my recollection my angel mother who died too soon for myself and all who knew her   163.8983316795606
he is better said the host he fainted quite away   128.05421703995432
he no longer feared realities but phantoms   204.95899003530005
and then when d artagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good   107.37045373339909
i have them at hand monsieur   157.0175927126733
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied d artagnan   138.47925046812088
that cursed man my evil genius whom i have always met with when threatened by some misfortune he who accompanied that horrible woman when i met her for the first time he whom i was seeking when i offended our athos he whom i saw on the very morning madame bonacieux was abducted   160.7099193402739
cried d artagnan you sing charmingly dear aramis   95.48936511432969
twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in england she was already married in france   94.78757189669172
give me those papers and leave us   108.59485612849464
besides one must lay out one s inheritance somehow   128.34260025284698
if you can my dear d artagnan answer for mademoiselle oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris   130.03024839036527
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned   58.26200582542469
you may depend on my doing so sir said baptistin   160.76332673518743
omer without drawing bit   81.6314753643322
that man   98.74626388609964
this itinerary possessed another great advantage that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrini s story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up   157.5738788854307
and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office   121.9868816270566
chapter 111   125.66557619050715
i should make an excellent gambler if i were not too hot headed   60.27541437145876
come no hypocrisy   172.65758621487848
that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence   92.1851443410891
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us   108.27378589464706
he seated himself at his desk and d artagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter   114.10077664131988
besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english   104.58016458937867
if his heart is free and he will marry haydée the daughter of ali pasha of yanina whom i have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish   141.84464695700177
what you would now do amounts to treason   170.6260976744728
should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost   61.33396413709194
for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has done   151.49734989687286
i placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin   127.13069209683718
laugh if you please i really think so   106.76400180395744
albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man   1.493354433046278
port   153.79201181335165
you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the queen   175.9693000358964
said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to dantès   128.38811014858456
you frighten me   109.3681674844519
if you have two coats you will give me one of them   103.16121939280269
d artagnan became very pale   129.60078562201952
i say you understand this because you are as conversant with my affairs as i am   145.57296441233163
the vessel did touch at elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the island   125.35913418683604
the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery   156.2334788175797
ah that is a different thing   85.4681446445966
milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon   143.2006593247627
barrois said the doctor can you speak   111.19782398705627
they entered the common hall and placed themselves at table   146.63965366699
i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount   145.86447488204763
i do not love her but i will avenge myself for her contempt   143.7710813789934
she screamed aloud   157.17040638850602
he is a musician   159.65026708732358
but that ought not to astonish you   78.66282205503452
she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her   4.00224894971862
truly from my mother leonora corsinari   102.79299622025415
cried the count   162.7810232051607
the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim   149.16647163571673
and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning post in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy   165.84748561894784
cried olivain what are you doing   129.14662618732748
the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless   105.54513077794401
people in general he said only ask advice not to follow it   44.39154000331264
he will set sail tomorrow morning   110.46371152822603
what new gibberish is that   63.57203123336879
many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial   112.36060164425535
he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop   54.01387090289555
all these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was concerned   180.57437205508734
i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsed but there will be a conference to morrow and we shall see   167.65315820665532
we have reached it   188.7115404303424
the star of day pale but nevertheless still splendid was setting in the horizon glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration   59.50521789283867
here i am albert said   72.38294151936701
he did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the prisoners look upon with utter despair   70.9550265533958
the laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark   119.90899968702716
do you know that i am growing old   141.27855005640762
the cardinal became as pale as death   138.17545255625842
muttered la carconte when left alone   112.85635048219835
through or over   110.22580897158569
you shall not pass   103.84748530503252
but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters   131.44782363995324
if we can not we will do without him   69.65692025176928
said athos reproachfully   146.08443816952922
as to my father you will not see him   174.1397473505894
and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness   104.24107425354373
i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy   34.770565420000466
and rally to the old cry of france montjoy and st   131.78895046621588
why do you doubt it   87.41360768979489
true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together   161.58118050155082
who should it be but he who watches while i sleep who labors while i amuse myself who conducts everything at home and abroad in france as in europe   104.80415606657103
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself   92.43513325276494
now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m   135.42645582231248
after all i am not an unreasonable man   218.56630553163495
d artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when m   60.15294616579024
but to return to the charming musicians you should give us a treat danglars without telling them there is a stranger   119.69406009941444
and danglars sighed as m   79.29727013436427
how soft and perfumed was the air   136.24007431337583
here laporte said buckingham these are the only tokens i ever received from her this silver casket and these two letters   130.53295700823293
eagerly replied the prince will i permit   84.5440108607436
i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap   63.98250763901428
paul or of the place de grêve   80.91924813712961
half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and economy   109.35530318336059
i feel the blood flowing towards my brain   146.73258212775187
monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt   123.24506728118821
suppose we warn the masters   122.47218030965065
repeated madame danglars her staring wide open eyes expressing her alarm   136.35367419361265
you can not have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or gay   188.85519880867668
cried milady must i name him again   91.57403231334447
and he fell back on the bed pale trembling and apparently about to die   184.02337350050644
what is the matter if you please   53.87914695169285
said franz hesitating   75.08533855108641
monsieur porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains   177.83647839197147
i believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone   152.57114165890346
and what effect did this discourse produce   141.57497101689026
we are about to have the honor of charging you replied aramis lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other   163.04470967876352
did you drink some too m   222.5688412071144
noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no   100.88684168393073
but as i determined to have a house to myself i sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it   159.51911289089134
ho there champenois   125.73717644693734
what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure   92.28550617723569
aramis you think that d artagnan that porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy   138.82258901781597
the scoundrel   117.54640382598079
i hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence i shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that i have been able to prove them to you whilst i had the happiness of living with you   111.39703794530824
and now do as much for the queen   143.61684482391493
and he assumed a look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have envied   63.16861024407933
but in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards   98.5191525932341
said d artagnan at last   105.92487738687582
assassins   158.15041693348803
but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt   132.59080562683573
the young men looked at each other with an expression of fear   127.902937491006
they have abducted her   119.96710314164554
i wish to say three words to you monsieur chevalier stammered the soubrette   100.06700416733865
but what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead   186.4924872227898
you have one second to decide said he   38.657731529168984
this was granted   122.8811966573057
d artagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for porthos but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it he consented that porthos should share his couch with him   102.77950641227426
the soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away   144.70129605919885
then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him   46.63787332740149
you promised to obey me implicitly   173.70097126233867
it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o clock thought d artagnan   133.70608422544635
the sailors looked at one another   53.96244954242593
excuse me my lord said the lad   129.64158006442707
free   23.311887975040193
caderousse rose   177.60655422652468
you will conduct us yourself then to that door   119.90633311240455
juxon led them away and this time the doors were left open   250.94860841266245
a daughter of henry iv   157.96726284732844
his insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor which he had climbed four steps at a time   113.45452240401751
d artagnan was on guard at the louvre   98.54972153186844
it was only known that on the following sunday a te deum would be sung at notre dame in honor of the victory of lens   42.931478400779994
d artagnan is for mazarin he said to himself   83.37343908870918
i know these airs   148.88926084751125
it is probable sire replied villefort   164.5755141774121
that s your opinion   135.19070718399217
before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward   213.5173751424048
the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue férou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abbé busoni were within   91.56199444905204
let us shut this one up   79.02244664427242
in the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman s happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings   62.957623772904775
let us go and die with them   191.59354913401376
i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me   178.62331399335068
monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given   111.11975341472137
said d artagnan pressing her hand more closely   93.75621012649978
do you regret them   81.5046294141335
who can tell whether dantès be innocent or guilty   141.35813095218194
gone never to return   27.17413214257931
if we were to see you fighting i can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you   184.9779469907776
but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them   61.52323949627679
your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable   21.24377607149937
ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment   46.28862142095893
you see you still are king   153.98475037770436
franz was too far off to hear what they said   69.99936897138954
but i will tell you a true story my lord   176.63362256882778
as they went on teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees   48.79519826627798
madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album   100.71269677280773
i have already had the honor of telling you i was said morrel   123.66368362397448
by the latter i mean your relatives and friends   145.1903945828123
de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king   117.98288685895196
and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between us   147.15749949904924
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan   132.62807132866786
antoine he turned round to look gaily at the bastille   105.18683766134322
and mademoiselle d armilly said the banker   151.51353951967758
a procurator s dinner however brilliant had been the part played by porthos in the duel it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurator s wife   55.360473866847286
it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey   86.88164201301802
said madame de chevreuse eagerly   89.70759512068904
he could not breathe   83.13629733937478
you are difficult to please viscount   155.50673414414126
monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission   162.01836555998932
favorably or otherwise   47.171553506269575
the breakfast at m   105.51775375356706
the fifth sharer in edmond s bequest was his own father   141.9676762976823
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results   124.35133952969385
said danglars pretending to restrain caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor   122.7247177911766
you have then seen something   223.1387658886349
this army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcher it matters little colonel harrison   115.69096874010923
he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it   133.82705679736088
de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me a favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness   116.74958484892029
nothing replied the latter   99.69574137895943
very good very good   78.47996268393933
the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter   84.35578156636113
what i most loved after you mercédès was myself my dignity and that strength which rendered me superior to other men   97.36477374364009
plague on t my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me   123.78196342245727
shall i tell him that he can count on you   99.53986208211819
at nine o clock the president of the club presented himself   103.13087461005745
it seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought   81.23522798686007
thank you a thousand times   143.60493605992275
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back   133.68013458396155
a black point floated on the sea   89.43648905559
immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city   187.67074939928824
he did not speak but showed the paper to dantès   145.91388606229953
monsieur de beaufort or another   6.004058694198065
you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal s guards have so many proofs   112.7664652737799
the story has been told by the corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it   111.74603840633048
when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men   73.89027307815249
and i hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothed mademoiselle eugénie danglars   103.38509873705173
and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father   63.76866870914643
ah gentlemen   73.68014600940265
still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i can not explain to you   94.17886291201106
chapter liii   34.49176741268592
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another   114.88712837199942
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god   138.0715443384733
the only chance for albert s safety then will arise from your emotion   63.500364890338524
yes returned the duke i must confess i sometimes think of it   26.790425685906627
de comminges went away d artagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation   130.31544720064525
then he rested   64.46711121627115
exclaimed friquet   87.94646642322964
insisted the count   199.1319273726155
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession   60.37744058482168
that is true enough returned caderousse   81.71020969557887
de saint méran had been unwell for some days   126.06192952252292
cama the pilot of the saint ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales   101.2929267522233
and mind if the wine is bad we will send him to find better   68.61222482835169
there was a great deal going on that morning and many business like persons at the palais   161.23372903717438
they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter   18.50200798233385
but how is it that you know so much of these matters   146.668306689488
and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him   179.3534488085778
said danglars to andrea   140.41818092040475
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours   64.47347628923481
this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things   143.75377676563974
anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m   86.72719214602168
well i will remain with you   103.80415023668442
cried chatillon   64.16267439874062
but since then everything has changed in and about me   121.40851948430449
they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and thirst   107.08915680656487
now nothing of the kind has happened   94.77832073967255
and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn   107.69753921220118
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity   128.8195563634285
inquired danglars with an air of indulgence and good nature that made monte cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker s domestic life   76.23979797303468
i was there when he fell   144.5277138471797
no sir said danglars   107.92892431629735
there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes   107.54471038042601
the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it   131.5691739313711
for three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic   90.55790425884639
he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that   63.45952111592178
bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand   129.80229154052978
as well as you do gentlemen   91.97845077536047
well now what do you say to a cart   97.05140621585112
now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties   177.64581407085282
oh my god thou knowest whether i am guilty   119.29611436297851
i speak frankly to you   116.93930197995145
here sir said a voice behind him   222.02823631322207
but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is another s   64.7297523136355
yes said monte cristo i recognized him   148.90252079056222
behold   122.3108491826943
it is with madame   129.05992152320002
none can fly from a dungeon who can not walk   73.27321058532769
and that is the very thing that alarms me returned dantès   73.04125490851459
do you preach them   143.943225020885
if the thing were to do again i would again do it   54.65226192319036
i wish i could say as much   155.73428626543955
a little town on the lys   37.718539455916755
no said she withdrawing it gently no my friend touch me not   207.21271452026534
madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction   145.44058291558082
the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of de luynes   41.2750482607038
oh said morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do   105.13783047799973
come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o clock tomorrow morning   99.13725427714732
martin giving half his cloak to a poor man   113.00268920886475
she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man   82.86015856824932
exclaimed dantès in grief stricken tones   27.867502947729292
and here madame i must add another word of explanation   129.66533615296174
she had seduced and ruined my brother a priest   114.55240740604738
you are my sister in religion   92.9840786056611
and i answered you porthos that it was not a good plan   82.29999715723073
lord de winter tore his hair   141.75060477919072
the prince looked at grimaud grimaud looked at the clock   179.57137826925361
i assure you that as long as i live i shall never love anyone else   79.74077876066492
order whatever you like for supper the only thing i specify is one of those pies   84.5766491007274
d artagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding   97.70868004001568
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you   142.3588888805488
like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position   89.4428907927274
then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly i would recommend you to travel   101.20316123472855
he learned their numbers instead   61.67239637427923
porthos s chamber is you say on the first story number one   147.10316334433688
it was a terrible moment for the young man   208.85637180184804
upon my soul these women would puzzle the very devil to read them aright   105.25286683638804
i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet   98.47479225023831
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady   110.7126185595056
he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard   156.3203632958673
and d artagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends   69.74643491315825
precisely said the cardinal   106.01108892842785
my lord who told you that   118.88044671233838
albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe   121.65255036577683
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights   83.744161698135
he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d antin   18.564712046808253
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders   97.43398877341303
according to your idea then my brain is turned   166.1138564271297
this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable odor   76.4389571938932
a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady   137.90977827828166
asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud   113.28565868754465
rochefort said the cardinal you see monsieur d artagnan   88.46933903539492
the first that we have not finished breakfast   92.35602766606237
there was no address on it   135.18312764274248
this peace will require a negotiator   148.00669809879142
well while i was watching not the king as monsieur le comte thinks for i know what it is to see a man led to death and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill while i was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as i said to find out who he was   167.16563324802587
on the contrary returned gaetano the chief who was told you were a young frenchman invites you to sup with him   118.12225496193577
i will come count i will be sure to come said villefort eagerly   110.81702159062773
cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean   139.80358816145187
yes said the duke smiling and i even believe that i know that other person   103.47131478073291
his eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand   134.7333524658799
it would be impossible to describe mousqueton s astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men   143.36596141079943
i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so   11.132038016001275
it would indeed be a pity he should   125.33234550220907
but he did not return the paper to d artagnan   162.85816229730162
50255m what   101.21753368464393
to horse my friends to horse   135.71108155695686
the house may be suspected   148.65729229153655
oh a letter   136.86279789320358
disguised as a coachman   87.7840230854401
she then opened the door of her alcove and went out   32.96373821322061
want of fortune perhaps   103.91142776174149
when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal   38.132055220808994
could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend   153.64163109494126
monseigneur replied d artagnan with an embarrassed air   97.63810025186007
women   91.4669891032635
the red duke   102.5629319642455
ali bowed and left the room   72.44218560827682
then all is agreed   133.47780043591592
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water   133.16757929980753
please god   102.14089230866914
that s all   58.15946092254068
what did mazarin do   74.7253781130347
the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest   127.40295431228697
they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain   107.63018566585285
ali looked at his master for further instructions   67.61223848774256
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain   77.035034399892
what is he aiming at   36.454532544999395
and do you really repent   88.44274704976644
i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about   126.56463996846153
my dear monsieur de rochefort   87.56958232625999
it seems that i am named la bruyere remarked d artagnan   130.46569943877432
everything said he to raoul shall be done as you desire   139.61683199597294
cried the officer have they killed him   128.89599365655187
three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic   134.5968157318291
and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him   66.78141197075172
we must accustom ourselves to parting   33.36622133004677
d artagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past m   137.6368515573284
and faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the apartment   66.40498664442231
go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes   174.24687925370708
if you die my lord i will die with you   141.05544160472064
our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant   111.70793905973588
why yes he is actually insolent over the matter has already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker   72.59656843307175
he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission   119.52070996068616
you prefer then said the abbé that i should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship   139.5514293046156
monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos   18.854058554153198
she was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart   127.23787042456983
what you tell me seems very strange   122.67410768810373
that will fall in wonderfully well   47.62060486703058
well said comminges suppose one thing   60.288989960949586
i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others   91.94728767500064
cried valentine in astonishment   112.90148948855196
he passed along the same corridor as before crossed one court then a second side of a building   114.01144949493047
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne   112.40685091858265
you edmond on the contrary you are still young handsome dignified   76.98016416455243
if he wanted valentine he closed his right eye only and if barrois the left   23.83918719298248
one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king louis xiv   101.84385745669222
i am ready my son said mercédès   115.03753242731935
the prince will vanquish you as he has always done   131.81609119132472
aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warmly   25.78483106899114
it may be   119.66919407250452
then said morrel i understand it all and this scene was premeditated   148.9457475765169
exclaimed d artagnan draw up the blinds of his majesty s carriage   183.1184230761566
dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart   133.90901807176107
honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door   41.06721568962894
mademoiselle de scudery was going   12.335898072835576
afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag   90.79558726378022
you are still with us i presume   148.378915311091
aramis was the next to come in and to discover athos almost insensible   43.06227161769944
but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition a function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish i prefer my own specific   84.91166217507549
and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i pant to make a reality of it   122.41244970426827
for instance there is apoplexy that lightning stroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end   160.19823841218124
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse   72.61791421186463
and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance   114.47982339016876
well i will tell you a secret   177.50743485438522
but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature   135.93577503064733
the marriage feast chapter 6   151.41670242049844
adieu adieu   88.35441413973199
it is told that the duc d antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed louis xiv   125.0813565363593
these men are going to behead your father   168.82926271139672
the insult was terrible and although unknown to the rest of the world i felt it live and fester at the bottom of my heart   86.62041754026856
albert threw himself on beauchamp s neck   115.27407508217426
i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled   147.1905207772733
d artagnan who foreseeing such an event had kept his eye on him sprang toward him caught him in his arms and assisted him to his chamber   125.46850258400514
the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed   84.1939640288785
ah yes i know   131.28209582834282
five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess   141.63805718855536
yesterday morning it appears franz declined the honor   81.30590915536999
ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger   116.30926594822738
farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart   178.25688309828342
never fear quarrels but seek adventures   167.93689318294528
from yanina   136.35994714390876
tis settled said aramis   115.19391867078818
mousqueton was seasick   180.9090728198172
there is doubtless some mistake easily explained   55.88171635558587
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears   169.8943564825147
20035m here is said the englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of 200 000 francs to our house by m   106.90735431571876
and who is this cavalier henrietta   38.067450983359706
conduct us my lord to the wall   138.8210147607511
five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs   186.1080726945867
tis here said athos   95.20368025353693
it is important that none of your crew should see me   99.89850382141672
but then by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position   192.55566028917218
it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back   161.0561817807327
but persisted the queen if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart send him help of men and money for i can do nothing for him   81.83277090792394
but where is the captain   179.96238850568307
nay said she do not smile   110.06170222242314
then noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat   75.3911684804969
he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular   207.98305998067283
the way was opened for you unexpectedly   171.9649061645568
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness   70.4712561640717
you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these   170.1422741640523
but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside   98.3915181982303
during the whole of this conversation valentine had remained silent   111.69896618244829
his reflections were not very cheerful   78.12721328916169
returned bertuccio in deep contempt   95.08862775969578
some one who would know how to cry aloud to them that all france might hear it that it is mazarin who has reduced them to poverty   57.16142710270884
it was arthur   61.519113691521795
relating to him   137.02537153490658
do you leave me   74.5856299040496
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door   111.32537036959161
but said aramis if i understand rightly we are to kill them all eh   31.84611667639446
this i ask of you in the name of the interest with which i inspire you in the name of the service you have rendered me and which i never shall forget while i have life   120.09886895352113
well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old burgundy   104.82489333072374
porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard   74.40361883924587
and yet added he with a coldly menacing expression he annoys me   110.26633019952476
cried d artagnan my letter of recommendation   132.13457804374295
she was a charming woman of twenty five or twenty six years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and opal   112.3859605606823
for though i don t think his aid worth much one must with one s friends observe all due politeness said d artagnan   128.05702527355822
confess   167.75834733949378
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house   192.02835603276924
they are no longer sure   94.49353235392437
cried aramis swords   142.03099147859172
poor danglars looked so crest fallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air towards him   112.50037337715885
no of you   122.11815956381619
you are right mr   92.581449392527
monsieur porthos what do you say to that   113.57102316997627
oh i repeat it edmond   106.05304051445043
there is no harm in over precaution   43.85801736705639
cried planchet so you are back again in paris   138.7513048483031
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers   139.56241941069987
sacrebleu   81.7400236197966
do you desire it as ardently as you say   108.71038845465384
at the words i will beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to albert s countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few moments   149.86270625625633
well said gondy have you kept your word with me   78.98575937158131
you must trust to me   94.82851467095561
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent   91.92195060691998
the chieftain of the party drew near   114.66471765968639
no not that way i beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the hall   133.92105598358384
i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so   81.86296964043878
there was to be sure father joseph but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice such was the terror inspired by his gray eminence as the cardinal s familiar was called   85.28914274253817
the misfortune is great   143.91104432987493
that s it said the cardinal that s it   99.42442716140481
now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my door   165.0011563347318
where did i first hear it   166.8926294812528
franz d épinay started with surprise   62.14396855911139
made richelieu smile   97.64861392026815
alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerf s brow we do not act thus in italy   91.24112136498223
yes said château renaud these italians are well named and badly dressed   201.01120944769332
true i forgot   44.18124838620493
have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled   91.3032525142032
more more   186.869121123262
but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy   127.37385935632031
de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost   80.49902992454527
take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother   149.32253692326134
say that i am permitted to walk in those woods   148.1488860931016
your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount   76.60716499556929
the coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres   175.15830133992873
they employ him because they are afraid of him   187.14688834262023
i do not reject it altogether said athos   144.65089314333164
and he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat   76.3290689999798
and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it   212.10414491408199
i shall be obliged to give up hunting as i have given up hawking   82.955487190867
and so in fact he is said the owner   87.61237498009737
dantès repeated he edmond dantès   72.85328144454576
but mon dieu   162.6235560281855
the old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright   117.91088401468471
you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy change of scene   106.45990621175916
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out   65.56499267716235
raoul entered at this moment   110.34488030270212
they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people s misery   179.96542004360697
and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear athos from that very day he becomes my son   220.9620150084827
i must absolutely see it   97.76655801943069
we are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family name   81.00496289524523
though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow horse   115.46626621718721
and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left gaza   100.73893150290417
one doesn t hit the bull s eye every time   76.22454415861012
she had tried to assassinate her brother in law   86.88421428671279
you have rightly guessed madame replied the count   113.42325799318697
yes sdeath   161.9582511476037
do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful   131.91281027336578
then came the royal carriage with d artagnan on one side porthos on the other   98.24777040271701
after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do honor to the gift reappeared with it on her finger   111.17439137608733
a horse eats out of a manger in which a glandered horse has eaten   111.28427291966312
or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it   168.5662952646331
so he cherishes no resentment   73.75316056766522
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy   160.98202316464548
in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow   110.84191002727715
i am sir a living guaranty replied monte cristo motionless but with a threatening look   55.66206101029316
i think i shall send him to paris   203.02554567797856
better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you   176.60812753682313
we shall have occasion i warn you at some future period to speak of that   131.30494178406266
immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies   112.12317157705844
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the pharaon   114.89772115141683
i beseech you madame replied monte cristo not to spoil ali either by too great praise or rewards   170.1540235035506
i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air   151.42588671475863
i am willing to help rebuild your fortune but i will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others   124.26158403664452
cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse   101.61225007816608
this evening monsieur i am detained in paris by indispensable business   151.92010561963102
just god   123.92878953648307
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table   89.72479011161364
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair a head like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him   121.50661531522798
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope   154.87437006294854
aramis was astonished   128.01365862501666
that was the question   133.94861826515677
you are very fortunate to have lost believe me my dear d artagnan   75.51337721410268
the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato   87.77164212622323
i can see it all before me this moment   48.536300340482185
then morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate   142.04435014629263
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother   135.61347081702772
is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an enemy   148.5461412250572
the police   88.04509746868311
at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors   134.58201619023134
yes said porthos i see him   135.91025536790212
repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it   76.53079356693101
are there then two parliaments   119.2910912463376
that is a settled thing a resolution registered   81.23193378859155
really my dear m   168.78825874619932
asked cavalcanti   144.75951385346812
major bartolomeo cavalcanti eight   161.4741895297986
he will be furious   112.19784840912835
i tell you one of them was saying that if coysel predicted that tis as good as true   103.32065857509883
2d february   107.35339933542511
asked the doctor   49.86284316854467
give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants   167.51268548407688
d artagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which porthos explained thus a very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere   23.85128352774052
as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scene again before me as if i now were there   33.91738384637705
hark   168.0033120093235
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand   123.93427833975605
look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance   75.32608036283713
de morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him   142.9818761428947
you don t often speak athos but when you do speak it is like st   150.73557687756704
the count put his head out of the window and whistled and the horses appeared to fly   45.112465629794656
you want to know how we came here   113.48486236479644
oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m   111.7338684605763
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity   179.82321307091115
you have said nothing have you   87.80518509534673
and you have reason for she is much to be pitied   138.57285243803446
perform your duty in camp   76.76392058388186
the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting   206.0979603124719
yes sir and i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti   186.6124793934482
i am a man of order sir   50.21456538579939
although d artagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercer s pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart   94.02467322923265
well the abbé adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage   154.42462543642915
france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch   91.72316331130322
well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said d artagnan   72.15239204605834
rue de la fontaine   87.50268559447443
and now come to the other side what do you see   123.0088201079106
ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine together   148.2356747521619
do not speak so loud young man don t speak so loud   121.59503860330264
pray be assured of that   64.9391216399621
spada turned pale as cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread   136.8472656077543
had i ten yaninas in my family i should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times   78.21620557035435
but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m   153.50047819840245
well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again   69.52355351951357
cried grimaud unconsciously   132.87313868680326
what could i say   164.498469340062
grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten him   74.55972660709583
you love me you   114.07445765900515
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice   90.7025228080757
but raoul   160.86334652817567
monsieur cavalcanti said andrea do you believe in fairy tales   113.73560297061044
well provided you replace your pistols in your belt   126.42047132999554
and he jingled his money   98.68049553032677
my strength is in my weakness   169.90989455127703
it is instinctive   112.63732047689868
and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii   170.03689838987998
my lord said d artagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinary that is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible   128.51827589957912
said athos to the commissary if you have no more need of me send me somewhere   117.74172149567272
i wish to see everything   158.8070176966488
the executioner is still in the cellar where i presume he has had an interview with mine host s bottles   55.58405375822312
the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third   77.08996230658293
but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent   152.3726399033777
screamed nanette   92.27147707388906
no in presence of the scaffold as i am royalty i assure you is a very small affair   62.90629196425015
has he sent no particular message for me   66.70501808451522
and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children   94.66272551178034
and kindly add continued he that i am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary   66.65914021090788
you aramis   217.70760271464772
d artagnan did not smile   97.7510302715328
why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest   129.6753789951488
he is awake so keep on the watch as they are gone away   92.97309602388732
in order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter you will find enclosed an order for 2 400 francs payable in florence at signor gozzi s   58.01633495910753
to the residence of baron danglars rue de la chaussée d antin   150.75000287111
why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment   146.44860199359073
let go and clue up   141.80660277700218
nevertheless d artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him   51.61483462656182
fly friends fly   175.49492654282383
i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it   52.874016824883064
to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor   185.67013608108428
edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result   144.40130865693544
no upon my honor   185.16816382359926
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked   112.48124714635674
keep the purse for your lackeys   175.9212827574097
but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence   129.3187087177983
you think so do you   178.65065717979573
don t let us disarrange your eminence   46.86825215631994
which route must i take   162.85336277407902
but richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious boy   123.32856832624782
teresa gave him one only instead of teresa it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san giacomo   104.20573991381703
the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of père lachaise where m   88.29754405585444
consider well what you do in that house   93.39269992232374
as you please my dear sir said the jeweller   37.6242995316407
my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you   88.00855304572828
and i have noticed that what   79.22817100490816
what you don t know me   58.2949216775317
the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young lady s diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly   131.17733174723344
let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for eternity   128.40489907449154
do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do   102.60047104890144
besides germain was in the interests of the queen   90.12574757200758
the duchess held him back   93.10446257859427
and heaven knows there are hills enough between rome and florence by the way of aquapendente   152.23256111117928
cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning   166.02007825561014
cried mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement   120.88951092036655
a black satin stock fresh from the maker s hands gray moustaches a bold eye a major s uniform ornamented with three medals and five crosses in fact the thorough bearing of an old soldier such was the appearance of major bartolomeo cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted   52.084040313839886
when she chose   124.52083710935534
aramis pushed his back into his saddle bags and sheathed his sword   135.20595526404477
but i am not the less a giddy fool   137.6468544507336
my lord said athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much pain   73.15452269093359
tell me at least the means   156.98637696630243
ah my god   102.52366773676009
thought gondy   128.17888464995295
it is for something else than that i imagine muttered d artagnan shaking his head doubtfully   14.581182894978
chapter 2   151.83785598418524
d artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution and both light as shadows glided through the interior door into the passage ascended the stairs as quietly as possible and entered d artagnan s chambers   67.59252461474671
no it is not worth while   194.7212285836489
this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape   138.08253929737415
upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the duke s arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust   173.84516239510725
he then said something in arabic to ali who made a sign of obedience and withdrew but not to any distance   93.5626555270592
but why do i not   115.66108280741176
do not cast yourself against such a rock   113.90437150896237
but so little it can hardly be called eating   42.698906049286265
he entered after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial which always announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions   174.48495004112158
a bright spot burned in either cheek her respiration was short and difficult and her pulse beat with feverish excitement   79.10358266433911
count said danglars are you speaking seriously   85.05315026738134
the former life of the prisoner his transformation a review of his life from the earliest period were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur   177.74708092750532
d artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon   131.3310484246768
monte cristo turned away   120.76231669961327
villefort dropped his head and sighed   199.42545132552624
you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men   76.15309316058284
do you say asked the gascon timidly that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself   75.11599300564342
give me drink said he i thirst i burn   183.8594999984912
well then so be it   131.43851760392275
besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash one s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power   106.79630496472998
violence is the proof of weakness   69.2192338852431
he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury   59.94363375191648
deuce take it friend if he s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so   67.44763971883195
i followed him this evening to the opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen all   123.56698598139536
it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose   161.10735080160836
but my lord tell me she continued hide nothing from me what is in truth the king s position   109.05197507872278
you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking   222.17738050270572
and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves   167.0641930745831
shall you have time   126.84260880133455
at the end of the second day m   88.17288949059252
they ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again immediately   152.6845873762363
what would you not have accomplished if you had been free   103.087112636109
that man then was not that man said milady lowering her voice is my brother   161.7493134811706
after cromwell charles ii   134.2268713241168
lucien a great event has happened   161.50619631928384
some ham my boy or we can t drink   40.92965357281683
of myself cried morcerf   177.05628847468486
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be patient   176.3117915730642
oh you frighten me   70.8059335140776
the sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden   109.66027342196742
it is getting cold   153.3192106360445
that is very well before one is over forty   125.45111078596744
without passports said planchet   128.98018188199592
here is what you are looking for he said   118.56723995045823
he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh   98.71659311315896
the words died away the steps were lost in the distance   32.58892744077096
well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it   97.66375883705733
that is all i require   111.93701587096965
i must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage   27.77359965948142
really sir you are delightful and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne   134.98474582465718
and whose are they   103.00921100791047
this note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his confinement   67.92049770810414
40150m you understand me   107.45184673374602
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante chamber   130.66928999140626
i grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire   141.6542690232507
yes monsieur one and twenty years ago   36.64634872626978
said morcerf more and more astonished   129.92325168615716
now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting   16.396825392949467
but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him   138.32215032394208
exclaimed aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as athos do you remember when we were at parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate   235.5174711026846
why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople   121.94909048192521
de villefort pressed his hand upon his brow which at first pale had become red and burning   161.96873298682323
how much in that little bag   111.68791087541584
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title   147.39259996635326
then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation   122.3992382796834
is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for   105.86024613368912
come come continued the count i see you are still the same an assassin   69.3208459415126
let us return to my ring or rather to yours   82.6359813501105
that is to say excellency replied pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please   151.92351121778742
villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words   34.90662472478134
he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him   135.5515107554924
i go to the louvre   168.56831653299687
and whither am i to go   117.77388716275108
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon   173.91195943254291
it is impossible it can be she said he   110.16857753626891
do not dig any more said the voice   129.6002872923564
asked the valet de chambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom   62.670348142902384
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read albert s letter   102.49091908457517
you are acquainted with the young viscount are you   142.42395070619776
you are always the same athos great and generous   116.26888139076263
will you be ambassador albert   152.99013527434417
without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m   87.2712813287537
you will take their places and i shall not lose by the exchange   165.69192363605325
who was then only prince of wales   88.59911311225153
adieu master   123.47433419876822
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder   177.9726334843176
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength   178.92470403063336
well said madame danglars come and undress me   59.258632047087055
you must mount your horse and proceed to the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette whence you will take my horse and that of monsieur du vallon which you must saddle and equip as if for war and then you will leave paris bringing them with you to cours la reine   89.4313610527395
mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices   62.878292371604026
the storm broke about ten o clock   98.70115205792086
and yet you pity a man who without being bitten by one of his race has yet murdered his benefactor   141.52440947350723
he finds the cooking detestable replied porthos   83.46947894921753
took an active part in the return from the island of elba   134.91984377802555
the servants who fled from the house informed me   119.81740661225204
villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement   83.16947652434988
is it still only an intention your eminence   125.18787035449007
then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you   104.14253910616743
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself   116.08321117945046
you are fernand mondego the french officer who led the troops of my noble father   139.55257462671446
be it so said beauchamp   134.72429655512104
particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added danglars   102.4008302975491
did you know that   118.44007255448888
but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my mind   91.47319790531586
monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around   126.73501166525205
i am not a banker like m   167.57796772864577
our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent   2.841483441384625
did you hear eternal sleeper   143.16731434507662
but one recovers sir as you perceive replied raoul and we have but had a little bath   156.65214567763874
do you talk of your honor   119.43076054888533
bonacieux lamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomed the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting   70.43238795223533
to the sloop said felton and row quickly   126.69745789764085
he had given his word not to watch mme   219.1341883697852
i recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch   179.34300894071754
it signifies to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name is fernand   156.01694444118255
beware my dear d artagnan   98.59677741222572
their names   138.43631552573834
the streets are full of armed men continued d artagnan   184.3982399933356
with your permission said danglars bowing i will precede you to show you the way   85.32786534148865
albert started on hearing these words   146.86958884248008
madame de lannoy who is devoted to your eminence as you know   186.80095135596324
but no all was hermetically sealed   138.59814852666486
then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in france   123.8688851047746
she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty   165.6862484939525
you know monsieur d artagnan   110.72481470325687
gentlemen said he leave me alone with patrick and laporte ah is that you de winter   144.44813239230712
i said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a frenchman   128.43763071730595
at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings   94.91649473505473
my place of abode is no   112.8184076144288
this succor which came to porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the musketeer toward the procurator s wife   62.533571755253
but how is it that madame de villefort is not here   192.25733301235374
for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of good humor illumined the face of d artagnan   141.65835715865626
i met him on the boulevard on my way here said beauchamp   130.40019771110744
you lie said the abbé busoni with a tone of irresistible authority   140.31767911762546
like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love   138.5142467631835
the good george   84.88131020252281
villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door   162.65730642868044
then turning toward porthos the devil   207.72676296142924
these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity   78.94786912836912
the abbé faria   150.82779218282292
but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me   121.46261744580369
i am safe for a few days at least   169.11275608461642
what is the meaning of that noise   154.47057512311025
namely to find a man who will not fight   53.871310109434106
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen s carriage   117.59564387728635
who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m   184.08803263885153
a woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her   78.26379792677884
rely on me to procure you the other   110.87798326913025
the duc d angoulême on the east from dompierre to perigny   51.52781430201246
the next day came and passed the day after a week   111.56362638713598
grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes   162.77581561290316
it was granted and was to take place after her morning s levee at which in accordance with his rights of birth he was entitled to be present   156.4476940248471
we shall know sir replied the president   128.60586260999597
each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added albert with a laugh   78.41534020965801
if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment   85.0660823002113
instead of going direct to his study m   52.35739745859569
when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw d artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms   225.7533637738115
he is a philanthropist answered the other   154.75543328373396
but what can i do for you   76.77061738443237
near blois   81.1706249256039
i had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing   56.05387536199593
still silent valentine had promised not to wake   174.28121661292232
oh yes said de winter for they are the same men   80.52874302393043
very true replied the gascon but i always run away from compliments   153.81984193605388
you see it is your interest to take my bank notes   134.15902807590464
what do you want with me my friend   101.01027666912421
protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him   116.76626194556125
do you recollect in the arbor of the hôtel des postes at perugia seeing a man in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana   170.95074056963819
perhaps said athos   103.87080047359004
oh replied danglars since we can not leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dantès will be set at liberty   97.85790083057313
you are wisdom incarnate athos aramis replied   126.51583569925779
my wife is at durham and may return at any moment   146.65835414003345
and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table   65.80986102069289
d artagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise   67.01582969822995
extremely well   72.24050283114279
and was the sum a large one   178.81823978455668
just god avenging god   104.79569949655752
the event was announced by the cessation of the firing   85.8621854879004
truly athos interrupted d artagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of   131.30364324674613
you pledge me for three millions do you not   154.16858603480776
said he holding out his hand to the young man   142.67908199802721
dame that s a long job monsieur   99.0712405862602
how can he be the son of a great lord   141.14094115014365
thanks madame   125.33330643390559
there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant   122.45567927573491
he is at my house   114.67841158532876
he did   97.36874191357157
that has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the count   203.0632680369943
i had ennui and i amused myself with twisting that rope   179.85162335606304
that dear protector said caderousse   53.242921400617234
i will not quit you said vasiliki   162.05634792521494
holà bazin   66.14435969634576
is it about sending me to the bastile   131.55885705180216
yes during the spanish war at perpignan where fernand had left her   140.31279051357762
in france sire at a small port near antibes in the gulf of juan   110.11016788719905
how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning   161.48590511593187
but be easy   124.99770504866724
it is strange said aramis   141.3193174283008
her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory   115.23874167104509
and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by d artagnan   103.30051951579759
you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m   135.13421668819038
let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing   99.97524043523306
which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes   118.6425144682218
porthos and aramis did the same   37.309924744320014
and wherefore has he not been to see me   142.3797967768903
and you seek admittance into our ranks   57.80274287015526
in about ten minutes d artagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos   183.11685289465476
here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond friend caderousse   153.32676162987934
are you not aware that this italian directs everything both indoors and out   164.84703930428276
nothing else was talked of   136.68415521242883
it must have been for his hide for certes the carcass is not worth eighteen livres   106.69411331051303
well grimaud my friend have you seen anything   80.93438170201355
he would shoot dantès and then kill himself   171.6819538117319
or as you know your way go first   127.6690022864049
de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition   125.62250481812474
edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him   110.69179097322052
come fanny we will put her to bed   164.2896395059368
come you understand me   37.63323974294593
it was six o clock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp   72.72592275487881
bad monsieur bad   117.39219713631998
i must do something to distract my thoughts   166.08233942187735
and you sire prevent me from sleeping with your security   91.01343742228971
de tréville was highly astonished to see his protégé make a sudden spring become crimson with passion and rush from the cabinet crying s blood he shall not escape me this time   88.63169487106984
the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters   200.74824221738984
that fellow is no fool said aramis as he got on his horse   120.92102358339082
a second discharge followed the first   131.40945809039363
whither goes she   111.94767295982506
now in 86 400 seconds very many things can be done   229.87349290985145
i have received no orders on that point   55.65684894225641
said valentine uneasily   147.03410550809488
of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry iv   62.14191307167991
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy   65.24101543020316
only tell me how high up is your excavation   127.97304637071274
serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine   54.7573867660585
whoever did it writes well   33.727361699948105
here is the priest s certificate   129.1459376665732
chapter 86   223.67022619133206
there was a moment s silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness   191.3592829923565
he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet   192.14877446340486
yes monseigneur said porthos it is he   121.62732841910291
on the staircase he met signor pastrini   163.45417563606773
don t be afraid said he smiling   84.17145442188158
they mounted the king on winter s horse and winter on that of the king   119.61693192597205
well i own it   48.817169912406754
said the woman   133.40457950646186
do you know observed franz that with such stories you make me think of ali baba s enchanted cavern   112.58223187997855
my lord observes that there will be enough to go around   123.25603321807738
let us go the same way   165.60158109629197
de villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom   77.98797424141674
have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today   153.25441009145467
there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess nothing more   191.41085528130534
he found d artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante room   169.21428109744588
de morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty years   63.85337063080769
take some more of these cigars m   85.99289901828803
sighed bazin   128.85670616274334
you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said porthos   103.5594779296132
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil   101.28056863056325
all sorts of misfortunes   132.16127862838863
and beppo led him outside the walls   117.04023452252716
i am free replied maximilian and rich enough to support you   87.6374156687513
the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself   164.78888757941908
give me my felt hat bernouin   137.44737698893073
yes that is my companion s name   83.79747262283081
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar   139.3999141895718
it was three o clock in the afternoon   186.90821789516883
and i replied very well you shall have it   144.86190625010917
as to the cavalier in the brown cloak it is the cardinal   71.53539114013071
said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of ante room   178.82002978464314
the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear   146.72347920169648
i should never have the courage to come down again   143.5907531583387
of intrigues and secrets of state continued d artagnan complying with the recommendation   158.81906859836886
that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it   139.39192540848845
the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other   176.52385315685942
but after all asked porthos who is milady   83.86528939967197
are you come to fetch me   53.54839462901949
i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice   138.86414052282606
de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil   132.0636886690194
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and d avrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child   103.08141679892549
i tell you i am madame bonacieux   96.319902827428
and did you promise the queen resumed d artagnan petulantly to storm the tower of london to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is cromwell   169.75850032880786
tell the king that if he sleeps badly to night he will sleep better to morrow night   224.4520352221595
and does he suspect said mme   181.01474767756747
madame de villefort fell at her husband s feet   109.36352450007043
for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us   111.36595303859872
meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his bed   48.698300409315365
did i advise your father to sell the castle of yanina to betray silence   152.89428102264029
i thank you madame said he for the deference you have shown to my wishes but i think you want two of the studs and i bring them back to you   46.77153735351858
said valentine and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need   78.70194885314955
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistress but a wife diable   124.04337899617686
soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice   155.90151043700607
or else he should not have reached beaucaire   145.7430086152572
that will be a difficult matter to arrange besides i shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure   109.61291447278964
because don carlos has fled from bourges and has returned to spain   149.28007705766453
as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit   127.98008195445337
could never rid himself this horse was born in the house of your father about thirteen years ago and has remained in it ever since which ought to make you love it   31.5587586655965
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation   60.27728582684187
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle   172.87189292930992
of lofty stature   4.801165664377123
magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there   150.55095236689192
the steward gave him a gun   106.62556650805085
behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps   143.6062666624524
she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house   123.70273132908973
on the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike   36.42368639555873
all at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified bound   69.75755977193225
come in come in monsieur porthos   103.66699635355506
that s a match you are playing with his eminence   125.43317760111032
at these words the murmur without became an explosion   100.7107005146008
and who is it   170.2490916995508
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice   162.17624555540888
edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins   176.1641715772035
well a pleasant journey   176.83437994602463
they left their two nags upon the high road and ran toward the quay   66.15886472936494
of the important cities given up by henry iv   22.677465526347433
yes but listen this was not all   143.21154585560777
i thought so madame stammered the young girl   162.15457739176324
he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty manger   229.2277509294408
20155m oh i am quite sure   89.90129791716365
let us only remember the present   26.616156277080194
i heard her with my own ears   53.91189470778244
he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him   88.05558436866292
d avrigny and villefort laid him on a couch   92.87945996908866
to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women   146.29005631185905
mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to blaisois to follow his example   110.12910798422553
for the cardinal knows all and it is he who urges on the king who as yet knows nothing but will soon know everything   163.8051195528352
is being in love conspiring   52.068827680893925
do you wish to destroy me   109.99824451774539
nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief   129.47735142596733
that is what it is to be rich   107.9431062519678
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall   106.28176302624297
it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch   115.54280826827159
yes yes very sure   131.44758746561112
yes said aramis i understand   155.66443601579346
murmured the executioner   40.001852805393625
we must explain this visit which although expected by monte cristo is unexpected to our readers   128.02756566332258
he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pères where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess   142.21372155364958
as soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the neck   172.78996016114996
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la fere   156.91369992429668
it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything   12.156451404061613
at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park   110.5561020858949
i yet feel his warm tears on my face and his were not the only tears shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also   127.99264278687345
they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads   121.45991415681459
unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you   124.64297950634221
he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips   144.55731355705066
so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse   94.09607579214759
i will embrace your knees   30.14696391204781
well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow   176.16665074993384
now victory has abandoned him   110.27021019996195
cried morrel almost overpowered   120.10237063563122
continued she   125.28288996852757
i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square   90.68200438543737
no madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a christian   53.82692378467416
a great misfortune m   138.8299554212424
he exclaimed i forgot the recommendation of de comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four headed combination of devils   100.28434525890584
asked d artagnan jumping on one of them   73.90887098912455
the hôtel then is far away   94.42384320124344
tell him all about it baron   137.06436433215643
then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it   160.4025547147935
monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening   107.13627828625584
whom do i see yonder   106.3691526440513
then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs   121.44141280261778
i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy   45.20766580842434
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too   79.06205058193092
how old are you   59.98070124098623
on our account   74.29101969717718
monte cristo smiled significantly   90.87866028129925
young and beautiful   82.56256185527243
so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eyes   110.79212462123796
de blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister   122.3984791413723
do you wish these proofs these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed   105.8587282750502
the jailer continued now this was his project   121.35802642900461
the bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the ingle nook   101.66945615636716
i did not ask for it   86.32773741234834
he had no other   112.77144160122033
i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul   79.56499961796173
as nine o clock sounded d artagnan was at the place royale   114.89192477541023
why should you meddle with what does not concern you   164.6684266489101
villefort after having received m   170.4210451670411
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him   86.2448985392115
ah la ramee   62.27055717460733
i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship   142.22801143242057
d artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale   169.35126961647097
besides we are safe for to day   98.05008204070366
a murmur or rather storm of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly   118.35602370376357
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank   76.90064137838797
oh monsieur said caderousse make one more attempt try me once more   156.7414401641204
i do not know particulars   119.26548750899346
he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field   182.4811578605499
sang diou   97.62953702878212
at the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the amiens road pulled up at the inn and planchet and grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads   195.5013395477784
oh i confess it is all the same to me   62.4367904573945
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husband s arm   92.18036737548886
i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist   148.1973598320623
and as to your husband monsieur bonacieux he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille   201.26799157226384
oh said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it   168.31913296554265
accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis   116.35020935085534
you can not live upon your fifteen thousand francs   126.32610427706987
as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist   181.2069672355121
when do you wish the carriage to be here   178.75833726762377
as the flood proved once for all   136.6826487329697
a propos inform bazin   134.69133290936713
be kind enough then madame to act more compliantly   92.51320732160484
one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes   133.11145518695605
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone   146.28254749280555
and they both set out for paris   152.4990778770964
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty   106.58536111467097
he died   103.2791168252106
and you athos   70.87280042932832
render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritorious   81.34203720175734
yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation lord de winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future conduct   108.23924298152903
the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort   133.38585207981936
for twenty years i have tasted nothing but water   70.07601728371586
oh heaven forbid   140.96876337622587
i will go   110.79942659089336
if you can be satisfied with my dinner it consists of cooked tetragones and fruits   122.47678347971635
what a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar   110.17031612248046
exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation   130.77507112136885
two words from the hand of your majesty and your private seal   200.24983008304883
he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man   119.83745587431626
porthos meantime asked d artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey   144.24548607930677
is there any need of that   57.14147114298167
only we conspire against the rochellais   125.04201321619766
said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain   106.80937131380433
be philosophers as i am gentlemen   153.87398963419457
but what have you done   100.57549995585535
and what have you been doing since yesterday   75.6089253854518
this then is what you call devotion   171.28033876454197
well what next   148.35373241949264
said raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellow s life to thank you on my own account   140.87651602699614
a man can easily be put out of the way there then   126.94360811109898
answered raoul you joke about a real misfortune   126.94307894312082
and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to béthune   106.95266874297641
he was therefore silent   97.93210629767535
with a thousand pistoles one may face everything   147.5961881472402
probably said athos   102.9983521529291
delightful   128.90348985842277
but they will contest the will after your death   24.18204944338646
everything that savors of mystery charms them   205.72596872578416
his drawing room under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage scarcely eighteen was still one of the well regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained   156.55803462251697
one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me   127.62606811150414
cried he clasping his hands   67.5647268234764
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn   118.85093027865416
we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the 23rd of february will be executed andrea rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don césar torlini canon of the church of st   129.23717918218668
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word   157.34060966046906
i am in possession of all my senses sir he said   143.5741030797866
it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value   138.24715694634136
have you some plan in your head then   67.71337541497402
to be my second   167.13533987409892
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy   85.67753978495415
he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human   102.2423000506458
pray forgive me   169.35291711020312
if he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price   103.71612798301871
really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france   106.24712561738501
and now are you satisfied with your betrothal   150.10520080046228
how delightful to see you again dear friend   150.69274335926883
d artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude   245.92756466661103
i vow i should consider it a profanation   117.11973809557274
cardinal i must have the queen s papers   52.630750227081485
only one thing said the italian   101.6597805630571
besides this time my visit has a motive   129.70316359171153
we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter for whom he seemed to have a great regard   172.05344610237444
i am looking for the person who let down the ladder   140.38104586093903
the steward of the duc de grammont   115.90787592167251
d art   76.02508431747611
deuce take em what a popular commotion   90.30813920053544
0159m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that moment we will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderation but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès   18.110805559793278
étienne said he see why mademoiselle eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawing room and why she makes me wait so long   130.29686323976892
then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle mars s diamonds   48.377347026235086
his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself   133.65963096117522
but instead of going to her own room valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden   146.7485520675649
very pretty   106.28769435574624
felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture   179.69733783037753
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady s forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed   121.10996928952986
the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule   84.00826089952815
monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob   186.2378504107528
god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune   107.98802622264975
well my dear aramis you don t want three horses   127.65919634630042
for the musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his eminence   208.40482351034643
sir said d avrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentine s maid if you please   110.63027373340059
her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in bed   92.63666618048748
and have you them yet   180.35198062297366
and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy   93.76196038878419
athos you are becoming mad   220.09777121862777
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people   139.91993514432744
i have nothing but memory   12.719405744587249
cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner   125.84566003759504
replied mercédès becoming paler than the sheet which covered her   74.44449159160379
i do not see here she said anything but general conditions   144.689203892185
count i have your word said morrel coldly   84.32794661722419
exclaimed the young couple   118.83622666422303
and andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the man s hand leaped lightly on to the pathway   147.62066084322234
is it possible that thomson french are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers   135.07965050808184
speak then without reserve as without hatred   134.4044034399718
perhaps it is some political difference   171.1097428770699
cried aramis you set me thinking   178.4918549142845
50127m and who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings   167.21239444179645
the name is not unknown to me   154.35973219477899
he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency   121.88311008830968
but he refused   90.8726272959605
contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he entered   150.13774676656092
but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her   87.35557501095354
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court   78.47390433182
the evening came on and with it darkness   144.76178232425517
well i will amuse you   122.03313893346188
and i   143.14718879424498
40064m albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea   162.81111808761662
but you will find terrible charges   20.077766786087537
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coolly such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely   86.79374358585682
but de winter did not call   165.95654646938883
if i should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for you at dinner or supper for instance   6.510867337290563
answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust   199.70634142686265
so to horse and let us knock at their door   153.38292411923786
suddenly the jailer entered   122.35761065392218
my son and a sacred command   98.83713392799466
will your majesty deign to excuse me   111.94518716828237
you have determined then to abandon her to the common law   81.28202767741311
the truth my dear count   100.32684299421304
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine   98.37208197358416
do not fly then   60.24762240767388
not from england madame   85.75491742211925
and such magnificent hair   128.32436456577165
at the extremity of the wood d artagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle   140.6987655539251
this immediately recalled to d artagnan s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme   164.9995002727009
d artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes   42.29280665369383
he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris   163.04405893561403
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him   82.58502852270487
kitty fearing she was ill hastened toward her and was beginning to open her dress   148.26025689967287
i understand said morrel   66.32076835422568
they all four entered the tent   112.60493152027946
that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation   123.68339040228797
then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to d artagnan take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey   87.32282153805762
haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawing room   124.2266938317259
murmured villefort wringing his hands   81.41557583224306
let us talk like men he said looking at the count   115.60778018098556
but i sent the ring i had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted   125.9229249967618
de tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might without perceiving that athos whatever might be his self command allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him and if possible grew paler than he was before   159.3664336013897
i believe you my lord as implicitly as if god had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to him   75.69756004754532
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement   127.42484354176997
might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him   102.81853998829226
it may perhaps come to this in time observed monte cristo   74.93121136484267
asked vampa with uneasiness   64.6994415391803
we have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your prisoners   99.25831081936568
it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur   124.26085871630423
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions   139.9595666043088
we depart from one place and arrive at another that is all   142.34274660145607
call charles he added addressing the boy who waited   114.86457198102929
about that time   183.07589971951745
yes but answered la ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes can t be sent around a ball like a letter   89.62507380235468
said maximilian   114.33270904427012
the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king   140.8160488072422
the question then was how to change this probability into a certainty   135.83302819916446
you may venture to ask me anything   105.3232254211957
on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle   144.3421435094491
you don t like him my dear parthenie said scarron   137.02889712554196
but gentlemen in all this said d artagnan we do not think of the queen   133.38633514232885
but cried the young officer speak then speak   127.91653910129114
good said aramis taking a purse which bazin presented to him   37.15801768991453
one solitary feeble light was burning in the porter s lodge about forty paces distant from the house as baptistin had said   105.852392489085
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressing room which led by a side staircase down to the yard eugénie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle d armilly scarcely raised with both hands   114.1642813518832
an unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristo s in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m   42.478274639761764
i foresee in it the aid of powerful princes   118.80182865265229
anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls   145.41928007162664
we are both of us able to kill you and your eight men we two only   72.62570242767794
is it not some bad affair   101.25568888902357
and as i am not a millionaire like the gentleman in the next apartments said franz i warn you that as i have been four times before at rome i know the prices of all the carriages   64.8161349635283
these keys were given up to him instantly   200.00124666201992
i am the most wretched of men   95.81186426685447
sir said albert rising i will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons   105.05895245462025
these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long   94.91355263504269
after me it will all be over and people will hunt with gins snares and traps   145.63045727193165
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough   209.3321732922061
30207m good he said   88.5380883316162
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardon you from the queen we from mazarin which were we all four together would never be granted   184.06469673503918
his understanding weakened by such events refused to comprehend such incredible unheard of fabulous facts   135.97733319413823
should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side   14.310153074759398
you really vilify me   37.23582118836691
asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume   114.54933429497984
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance   108.11533462607217
with your permission monsieur i wish to speak a word with my friend   101.34177091201404

s half filled snuff box scarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad   131.70669128384375

at three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old worm eaten table was a tall young man of twenty or two and twenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled   94.9823854203263
his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers   100.87610008701637
the past is another thing said athos sighing   119.93204862598243

monsieur athos said richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept   89.47440869589907

monsieur grimaud   146.96116422431538
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag   100.07677467241771
monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively   123.54676665198154

the prisoners in their expressive language have named it the lions den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers also   113.71761464198546
they who love believe easily in love   124.3142556227331

therefore kitty surrendered   136.2133685254737
in three seconds d artagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust one for athos one for porthos   19.928873094563343
oh tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me   82.50712576878303
and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces   115.10704643103577

i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time   119.30765513359836
in what month   123.0377634361842
his smile was at once cunning and resolute   102.48177147908171
i remember now   98.2666517549356
an instant after the broken door was removed and the pale face of athos appeared who with a rapid glance took a survey of the surroundings   111.97784211766293
but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten   110.74071844589406

on the staircase he met the pretty soubrette who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly   188.02181339421637
then why are you still vexed and grieved   76.85629506321592

at one end was the receipted bill for the 287 000 francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel nut with these words on a small slip of parchment julie s dowry   77.53355889905973

de la trémouille s people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them   123.16289734560479

all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friend s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening   168.43789916492133
dantès examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form   107.68117519718069

you do not give us a day no not even an hour before your departure   76.45172788749846
20129m well my dear albert said franz turning towards his friend   94.0929858251043
he went to meet him at saint cloud and has not returned   137.59664425333634
captain said the young king to d artagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to day you and your friend the baron du vallon   118.13750235931221
alas monsieur said she that is too bad   119.20236547364172
the punishment of death replied lord de winter   115.47227899031786
it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you   239.93068344914795
the guide took them thinking them merely a few pieces of little value   129.6602119165612
i shall be proud to present you and rochefort walked on   140.48294281614233
there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations   174.61707306241513
we have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friend s chateau and there we have come to an understanding   145.60031865962796
he had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and fruit   116.92846873320909
but at the first words she read she became livid   4.362664262401552
now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion m   114.72282142973536
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps   38.785069206152684
de villefort s promise   73.07775962216971
if it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made   161.62607449789863
they descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor d avrigny   121.61302932958739
but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond raised his head and listened   142.76335124881356
if you want anything you can ring   122.16691247847305
it had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs   112.47879730728945
one of us would suffice   132.0279115574687
ah there he is calling me now   143.05423175671027
sir he said turning to athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the duchess de chevreuse and is she not the queen   146.97937907442613
she saw vaguely the future   110.70243843285796
it was the honor of m   105.54344954904248
go to the count of monte cristo avenue des champs élysées on the 26th of may at seven o clock in the evening and demand of him your father   86.33284309042196
asked athos it is as dark as a cold oven   124.33728083002234
at this movement mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage delight   43.98359806846578
no where i can confess   145.113050999358
valentine with her woman s instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristo s second and from the young man s well known courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him   84.17418851160497
come d artagnan said porthos bid adieu to your sword and go with me to pierrefonds to bracieux or to du vallon   174.3884355359053
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse   81.53592770816313
the king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him   95.25480911140141
yes replied caderousse little albert   138.88426293930493
he is very gracious thought the queen   69.22628694502961
gentlemen good morning   53.39612813078345
indeed sire i did not   126.53692678667572
is it not a curious affair   59.71858116123664
here is an order for two hundred pistoles   128.15575356272788
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this   101.82127960504386
she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world   51.2221466556612
when i am at the mercy of every scribbler in the palais royal who covers waste paper with nonsense or of every country squire in the kingdom   113.67318631174894
30 avenue des champs élysées   33.54727257488935
but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the convent des carmes   74.57700126506506
ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it   156.28114952480416
be easy my dear edmond we are near the conclusion   165.38929006654448
and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented   96.14875395804671
asked felton whose looks became excited   170.05334319809086
we know all about that   171.7416783926222
continued aramis   36.4432768101195
by her side i am spanish but the family of morcerf is french and i have heard one of the oldest of the south of france   107.8077440587654
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled   110.72102570071355
you are not wrong after all and life is sweet   68.93696431645844
the duke wore the uniform of the musketeers of m   166.4497561552963
he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any way that is if he approved of the person proposed   163.16826173341641
he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the count s box at the argentina and valle theatres   171.24986521576614
but promise me if you should not be killed tonight that you will go tomorrow   134.3810549784689
have you observed said he to them what a blood red color the moon has to night   201.6738027751964
said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old friend   48.45735381226834
it must have been charming indeed   65.84474037111492
he was a catalan   123.54095375165734
good to eat   49.72662765656277
we are not children   164.513310399455
but dantès who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three months   100.5258682256196
in case i should be killed said de guiche   118.92395090800835
monsieur said he as long as i hold him in this manner he can t cry i ll be bound   75.14138490967346
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through fear   92.58744490857167
you have done a little of everything in your life   151.37246177191685
brutes   168.67057686170597
oh unfortunate creature   82.50408762182843
a step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon   53.43666115793754
i waited at the door   137.00329377984454
look at this lady raoul she is an historic personage   157.3503023246413
these notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army   126.76242430800284
certainly and more than once regretted them   79.45023179738153
the will as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things   123.55371459258187
mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected   94.73448689247832
i am sure he can fire a musket when required   157.4874542164275
these two gentlemen shall decide between us   50.28300419507529
scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent   171.77938005601885
it is twenty years since i saw them and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them   75.5280189972432
he is in paris just now   114.59988011173758
beneath these lines was written in another hand see note above nothing can be done   33.788575553038186
and who is that other person   132.4947284183322
that his style of writing is very good   129.37311582801888
people are found every day in the seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim   119.53353455939896
but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior   163.8248641206205
andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one   131.63684579486738
then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton   130.57529692519944
and has visited with me that is in   140.87619650832
the album   194.37307667717826
if the king persists in remaining in england will you send him succor   59.43511040169448
perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbé perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive words which had restored the courage of noirtier for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine   90.31136882695506
on this paved yard are to be seen pacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadows the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharpening   83.13252430265723
there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance   146.35401624981478
de beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what i ask for seeks it out of doors   140.29093234559377
said my mother   88.59530044269724
the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes   161.43334208733975
said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men   27.31786856435724
i can never forgive myself   199.03778818636448
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass   133.33065918832276
while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table   174.71544572191453
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages   138.44544791266225
listen continued the abbé   104.37136601885543
i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him   182.7181558821879
and the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other s arms   148.72200975768064
the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room   96.75311927258414
they listened   93.70234065903823
i wished to live said athos   186.42855680065685
toward paris sir   125.8049714671457
had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him   92.59351111056743
but on your account i will add some eggs and that is a serious infraction of the rule for eggs are meat since they engender chickens   77.42611046958629
and who has seen this fleur de lis   63.01835421216941
the perfidious deceiver was as may plainly be perceived already sacrificing in intention the poor girl in order to obtain milady willy nilly   105.90089016011487
your valise is then empty   146.49092634208213
go and see cocles and if my father is there announce this gentleman   86.42995769905455
and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cæsar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom   88.62737667288951
we must proceed in an orderly manner   52.98199043590393
i was never in them   43.01248685584828
50121m no i do not replied monte cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching morrel who was holding his breath with emotion   82.42448998180924
he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him   72.65126889310903
he went into his sleeping room and fastened the door inside   131.27957270983558
adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my door   75.81387673812668
taste some of this ham d artagnan   57.66150955276837
this anxiety became so great that it even extended to aramis and porthos   115.26219555769545
i am uneasy about blaisois said athos   120.9241566890794
but what does this note contain   163.14012150056521
it was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to arrive   182.35337984722537
i heard the door open and shut and i remained overwhelmed less i confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself   187.34570763108462
the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it   106.8332760328486
now whenever the king halted the musketeers halted   116.10375457559203
do as you like she said i rely upon you   191.362943454343
then he took away his mother s portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty   109.52546118418785
mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude   113.23008123632115
thou seest simpleton said d artagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to us   94.02168942317044
valentine looked around her   131.47087559519596
the two friends mounted as did their servants   126.255232908031
are we not two despairing creatures   106.8911991496663
you can easily resume it when you leave paris   157.60639534357608
d artagnan was at the height of joy   98.56282953951293
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge hammer   77.78934142481408
and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece   120.87779316749504
i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within   106.56709218583231
who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england   84.94374343329712
inquired pastrini   41.97408576164236
do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead   101.79184486479971
and shall we arrive there   122.82543015859902
answered charles sadly i have but three one of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a week s standing whom i shall never forget   162.13266000720398
is it not true   106.40783618300368
the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome   80.78630030224437
then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played drank sang but that whilst playing drinking singing he often stopped short to vow that mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at vincennes   67.40902856905598
but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth   87.43171483939386
and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground   126.36859820682415
can this be another vengeance of that woman   112.79216319970446
madame replied monte cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julie s cheeks had lord wilmore seen what i now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind   92.00675743488594
yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock   85.89985546557892
i have been there mother said friquet but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned and so with monsieur bazin s permission you know mother monsieur bazin the verger i came to speak to monsieur broussel   127.31519910092794
dantès trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply   90.21473478825047
there is no knight errant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair lady i detain a prisoner   90.63836498527212
the duc de chatillon commanded the centre   176.9173670333551
if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished   32.73619694229481
i will leave you with this stranger   71.69624477065288
half an hour after the entrance of the king fresh acclamations were heard   127.11579718249375
but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to yield   80.74231127567515
you will take your place in the coupé to châlons   105.08243449314566
we shall require it   133.4727100098922
i command you not to stir attempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings   187.55833352264256
he saw mercédès enter the diligence and he also saw albert withdraw   87.02534916804407
my good friend said franz turning to him while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve   89.16029757914981
are you too proud to accept it young gentleman   71.2682925160995
who told you so   110.9554420192314
then no more of felton   180.065920718509
he cried in his turn   137.2960354726277
she has taken care for herself at least i hope so for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me   87.26248858803095
oh good lord monsieur chevalier said she what are you doing   208.7417917792211
he is named planchet who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago   160.01278475540462
you are eating horse   141.09063156680048
said porthos it is always that   67.30265152909561
and so soon too   98.01564897795384
debray is one of your friends   43.60653441453566
let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and death a fatal secret known only when the storm bursts   152.20503861274247
it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation   88.5885789785795
these three musketeers shall follow us said he in an undertone   159.45963873153826
he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery admiring himself before a glass   54.850232419042456
valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers   100.45604173347218
mazarin pretended to laugh   129.93445948153902
this is serious answered the three friends   108.050195441022
it is a rich study for you who as i learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map   115.02625621909361
he is also known to the abbé busoni a sicilian priest of high repute in the east where he has done much good   167.96630290226224
i must beg your eminence to observe said milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his grace distrusts me   122.00326896095329
dark complexion   100.83430673162385
nothing can gainsay such testimony   111.28213872810014
i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you   112.23489548269369
you wrong me my boy   100.24272240774445
one would think one was in the cave of ali baba   76.76367441127569
spada set out about two o clock to san pierdarena   139.95924515568123
noirtier and the elder d épinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced   110.80051829694443
madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face   124.86556931292584
but after all it is but a menace   148.37824355508153
you know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in italy   185.91927593925269
madame de saint méran chapter 73   130.7951437112722
i am an ungrateful fellow   101.28261078316548
and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints   90.027618230046
whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winter s athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to raoul s account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle   244.82956335708658
the company of m   126.22736850605573
no longer could edmond look into those wide open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death   164.78667701303863
by men of heart i mean men of courage   184.43066762444244
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey   57.649495162503015
she seemed to love me so   79.92572233011703
but why have you not fled   51.03576063544767
d artagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless   133.38212401116888
mercédès might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent   27.495675592692734
i have been advised of it   106.75861768784866
he only barks he never bites   43.09124491833495
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before   154.04935697651857
they all mounted the horses as quickly as possible   101.54203054093081
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison   88.04858744775427
as thirsty as a scotchman   147.71802518354878
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horses one for himself and one for each of his companions   77.39491360261083
yes monsieur you are right said the host   127.72647191743397
asked raoul in a soft and coaxing voice   93.97923103600118
silence and fatigue together overcame d artagnan and sleep overtook him also   56.479614026868155
exclaimed raoul alarmed   75.42410883965064
noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago   95.36705250903988
he went to him   187.34933057958517
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance   90.99520728793945
and where does he reside   122.72466239901931
it has arrived at the hôtel des princes rue de richelieu   61.793348947242166
had she one redeeming trait   70.29505252975815
what was the second   151.7204046918629
i am glad to hear it baron for i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants   111.59333734298218
his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads   144.7265068989421
said planchet is it you   125.7915654195575
i madame i   134.5506744369829
at that moment d artagnan opened his eyes   138.77826868643658
give all the information in your power   144.13895098954276
and i assure you   135.4284793620459
our breakfast comes from my father s kitchen   97.94386413939492
faith no thank heaven   115.15456045731945
to my grandfather s room   89.54853388567497
madame bonacieux presented her cheek to him   133.70637892802515
but for pity s sake spare my life my honor   68.68818135260071
all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him   8.385627572585378
in a moment they were at the canebière   100.32919120994634
two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as escort   108.1648249088776
they think of me in their pleasures as i thought of them in my troubles   85.3089080089936
i have descended from a planet called grief   78.6760203633896
this is the second time that monsieur d artagnan has been in england   190.2068052572597
these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart   137.16817513312046
whither should i go   91.87773418577711
i see spots of blood on the ground   91.07415853020623
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell s tent d artagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle   129.87854855486614
she was still exceedingly handsome   61.140551407187886
i was about to propose so doing answered de bragelonne   142.39474959662127
oh count have pity upon me   124.25102546398824
captivity the first day chapter liii   12.233136270836738
no one can be more so monsieur   13.019021327796793
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her   156.4793231890951
cried lord de winter   116.42622196874564
it was then a part he was playing   151.0250199722787
an association in which every one takes his share   149.93218182695142
de monte cristo and m   166.25364329705874
you might as well go and ride in the forest of bondy   122.02362383035745
noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her good night for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill   102.16437482798483
at these words he retired   111.0096472977704
but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony   115.94782120256991
the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer   47.5453410072987
do you think then that any harm can have happened to him   116.82188976773854
she will not dare to say anything   94.68070142745198
a man of the count s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones   61.13252435295122
sometimes on a sunday i take a ride in the fields and on the property of my neighbours in order to pick up a nice little quarrel which i am really in want of but nothing happens   197.60322239519417
the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle at the expense of his generous eminence   133.93127672929464
then said villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned   63.070268613986684
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir   113.31300221982367
amongst us a simpleton possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity who has an enemy to destroy or some near relation to dispose of goes straight to the grocer s or druggist s gives a false name which leads more easily to his detection than his real one and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping purchases five or six grammes of arsenic if he is really a cunning fellow he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced   27.90528293174532
they both live in the rue des ursulines   100.22343869137383
repeated the abbé   115.20294758696258
i have never before been at paris and it is the first time i have ever even set my foot in france   219.2247145620039
and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover   152.61425771776774
i am of d artagnan s opinion   152.25029762107903
but believe me that man has other projects   223.73436523135942
and he arranged mentally while dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence   117.39350911834322
the example of robert bruce will absolve you sire   42.73465038001598
as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters   3.4894373709668827
he held some papers in his hand   61.73915084538693
were our object money only he said we should be rich directly   216.24707697033756
on reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate   97.096698166207
you see i do not conceal myself   96.09560641194861
but extraordinary to relate the father did not say thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father   110.52414474908109
forgive me   136.77382366479597
he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beat the child was dead   171.24155266701553
said the king what shall we do   107.82296518357352
the abbé s eyes glistened   127.2412852192194
the jeweller smiled   202.4248587978301
the flaming globe descended afresh and i was completely alone   139.62463234583032
she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste   225.8386269121423
think of that valentine   187.3841216890345
d artagnan opened the letter and read these words a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest   53.22311630366105
we have always some difficulty in believing such things my pretty dear were it only from self love   103.33711639323404
ah said the doctor is it you   114.78663746677042
quite contrite and repentant   165.68719685657013
then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon   89.02091998541763
the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina   219.3370262255496
retire valentine said she   128.05161432293502
beauchamp pulled out his watch   202.31716759180176
and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement   122.42592189840632
then the inconvenience became distress   76.18994706814783
you are married then   71.48766565551543
the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues   108.89600367128972
what queen   91.52555305041435
on horseback   181.08728384632394
and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me   115.19497282474475
grumbled porthos   267.77545919916054
do you think i ever sleep then   119.22530113286174
cried morrel when i left her dying   107.20678012885915
porthos pressed his friend s hand and said to him yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force   150.16178611282612
on your return you can not make a mistake   111.4222249915677
what do you mean blockhead   61.94284115896554
his eminence sent me   140.71043958961113
he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still thank god good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner   115.51327621883507
only donna estafania   89.39935251513849
what connection can the new world have with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe   97.39759712003737
you go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me   106.4061864915392
but it was without wishing to do so i swear   126.44113499134284
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her   73.81552822416056
the groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porter s lodge saying pray does not the count of monte cristo live here   129.2694901614489
the duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his bolster   33.441436578635745
his wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen   56.348990508838966
we shall both get into trouble   82.4365026096699
d artagnan s bearing became still more imposing   125.99105041701868
she has a carriage then this niece of the doctor   78.86967125397051
if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency i would blow his brains out with my own hand   107.16549794470797
because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery   112.91696270509865
i said all that a man in such a state could say   128.8745537225251
sit down there said villefort giving up his place to morrel and write what i dictate   121.72341827272989
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity   117.23107392443038
he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread   135.19765344605742
you must not be angry with me for that monsieur broussel   139.9974335755881
yes monsieur yes   142.0563118750239
she has feared or guessed something   112.52567813087674
but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your letter   117.8607941692097
oh don t worry about me sir mocker said danglars   52.5857412853057
and immediately beauchamp appeared   158.5469139314677
we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches   72.56614059484684
oh certainly   91.86328827581991
i forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle   133.51387807788998
we even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty breach   108.10627763077235
he therefore looked forward to six o clock with as much impatience as the duke himself   72.66653792032713
my sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter   130.9279881862932
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady again   136.86504554213516
the count said a word in arabic to ali and the horses went on at great speed   57.8662305936636
but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife   96.03080940969046
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family   59.93642191374025
true i had forgotten it   45.011523517210506
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each corner the signal agreed upon waved it in the air and the man came up to him   86.38048081574897
i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort   130.6358642280615
ever since there were prisoners in it answered comminges   80.81871923224904
where is valentine sir   142.1748574676212
and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome   71.93220324319475
coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted and sighed deeply   136.45824488765223
here or in the neighborhood   38.1795627386722
i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table   92.45374090288139
the greatest possible gayety prevailed at court   64.4637114070186
there is the comte de la fere madame   161.36030443856023
yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful   101.14816534823024
the opinion of athos was that d artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish   148.21661996726118
during this time madame morrel had told her son everything   104.27900631453238
then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks   196.67622244955135
his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him   238.0670207892941
he jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servant s arms and joined them   20.506734129678293
they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination   155.07413095683745
the unfortunate queen who was constantly threatened with divorce exile and trial even turned pale under her rouge and could not refrain from saying but why this visit sire   129.75900694275515
28 said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order   29.366350029545984
could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel   146.3266629813014
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past   116.28255004490033
she is at the louvre as you know   158.87284441458328
monsieur laporte said d artagnan finish dressing his majesty   137.6501780748594
hallo   119.17109190221726
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile   186.71219466200318
that comes of wearing diamonds my master said athos disdainfully   142.22433917085436
i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder   106.4153296641372
a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner   171.2427394992538
can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future   216.01317400717056
at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled   149.11219123045464
monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed   55.87175838104872
yes you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you   186.7733881173174
that your lordship was about to treat with the court   213.5853265453144
he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of nessus insatiate in torture   67.57226244484673
but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land   142.13655309059487
civil war like a forest flame   26.794829361969164
i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m   134.5184314552111
milady replied to this question by another question   126.89536290322866
it would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said porthos   209.57350909593038
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort   47.752030162604385
i am going away the day after tomorrow   173.55813520420563
is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere   100.18164647410167
oh am i happy enough for that   96.92990414903089
i have written a letter today   71.2368665702603
furthermore d artagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow   95.7734078565528
the drink deadened eye of athos flashed out but only for a moment   156.7125607444852
the coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the st   108.72966109318655
the maid approached planchet whom she took for lubin and holding out a little billet to him said for your master   120.38094027451405
30165m noirtier s look was furious   173.99061712513694
on on   132.9852810364794
milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart   108.1693049325248
from a distance dantès recognized the rig and handling of la jeune amélie and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing place he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident   48.25133579791532
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandit s dinner through the crevices of the door may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth   83.63888159852661
in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled   139.46234022610295
it may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminence s guardsmen had received   95.91191815840433
but he did not blanch   153.90846850135895
worse than that she was faithless and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed   143.312682005201
he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side   165.7810146912169
he asked of the baroness   102.790896731185
d artagnan vigorously seized his prisoner s hand saying eh   127.30853644909126
and as to this book added she pointing to the manual with her finger but without touching it as if she must be contaminated by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de winter the accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his heresies   43.58310904778442
comminges glanced at d artagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up   92.40323486016271
the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative   102.62496700038483
then in addition to these concealed or public secret or open wars there were robbers mendicants huguenots wolves and scoundrels who made war upon everybody   66.93800510001175
were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clément ever known   141.64050008474032
my uncle replied mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken   49.199290034097785
my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady   179.33045893914704
then he drew from his waistcoat pocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand   138.37062848229115
halloo major   111.15354032738941
the young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless   95.76411432626526
because england had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is taken   99.40452162397644
franz remained with m   46.2672875712196
i know a clever person at tours aramis stopped on seeing athos smile   179.57061474542678
sir said madame danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not   122.10970456588895
and you think that your wife has returned to the louvre   71.79226177994434
porthos and aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabbards   137.75112140416886
may i have the use of your skiff   74.09216941530462
you are welcome monsieur said milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill humor which d artagnan had just remarked   118.31682259999029
that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency   137.67251722676514
he entered the hotel and ascended the front steps and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery asked if the duchess de chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the comte de la fere   104.06842834933065
monsieur replied dantès proudly it was only to summon assistance for you   40.40938085245887
what advantage should i have over you if knowing your secret i were to tell you mine   44.311412877503045
aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to d artagnan whose senses were still in a state of confusion   133.94464259511938
said athos to the man in english   94.17313312227282
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly   195.29981289080422
advice   91.59538829700996
returned the old man in a hoarse voice   144.60393455620607
we shall meet again in better days   105.23586079864319
but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains   146.92686917022547
three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps   136.97909562941675
outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection   81.15435877341528
he was the friend of the king who honored highly as everyone knows the memory of his father henry iv   114.02549376383863
and will you undertake to deliver it   85.41274694839134
the young men sprang up and seized their muskets   103.51692998376757
your servants will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape   156.39942256104771
does your eminence command that they both be instantly arrested   67.58789103958046
but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman   56.9827515329751
we all know that interrupted the king   158.27942534722428
that was a great honor for d artagnan and for porthos   79.05953592284435
grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so   150.8419201721257
what matter said monte cristo if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction   134.45743258519832
in the antechamber upon long circular benches reposed the elect   145.03307268394258
i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo   176.76523606888534
the man came straight toward him   62.31168428056959
said albert evidently surprised at such a question from his companion   99.6032604105024
but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you might have made your escape   131.18603182938355
she placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively   107.24542056084663
it is always with friends that one fights   158.86802011025298
it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydée s countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request   96.38507868612061
i forgive you   135.95074296264656
he feels that every man owes a tribute to his country   62.06490327137833
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tréport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic   143.645947328998
milady answered by a glance which said is that all   65.98368567819932
at the same moment that is at nine o clock in the morning albert de morcerf dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of monte cristo s house in the champs élysées   154.50133862235782
this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives   149.221564337651
edmond still heard the sound   151.4075001528229
and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes   53.18711985247962
already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht   75.13409785410656
athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions   133.2409957296204
i called you because you were running like a madman and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said caderousse laughing   161.60897840456346
it is really true said m   69.91264662715477
really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease   185.83142874833052
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it   69.09042763767609
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him   178.64100677267757
morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening   101.38078491214469
did you go into these houses with her   125.93062819662886
they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message   108.96336437559631
coldly asked morrel   130.34751330078097
de la trémouille already prejudiced by his esquire whose relative as we already know bernajoux was replied that it was neither for m   58.157275795558895
but will it not be lost   215.71493334645692
conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis   170.47449565282676
order them to be sought for   173.64301119804668
there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france   92.28049679872109
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript   122.07871746486818
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend   60.10623328526293
adieu my friend adieu   78.81395322851694
you have some   102.60431170912409
so be it   173.43356189729445
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned   175.31295113898992
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it   130.75751632671094
my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world   23.477675758595765
really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions   131.38613890849518
but gaetano did i thought   67.37345374217018
and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust   216.5669025442318
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words 11 october 1633   100.71264305455962
i have only just left him   158.73511074998902
yes of course mouston   147.34121207672047
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped   147.62762215804057
do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes   137.2652067371362
oh work work my passion my joy my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows   192.4706595201167
it is my fault madame said raoul   132.57407357130722
how monsieur an investigation of my papers mine   233.113456345536
unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i don t know where he is   193.6665300973967
leave me to pray   204.34882184044218
handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine   102.63349704123544
there you see it will not take long   143.12603135111718
perfectly sure   47.11411670940805
and i shall be at the convent of jesuits   45.61826945871836
demanded morrel   43.20363170499144
but the bastille   92.58400993742538
this is not a corsican maquis but an english garden   114.77393117335481
i adore her   190.4083309781112
as complete as that of the bridge of ce   95.86003123631527
if we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource   118.09077420570227
he cried the usurper in france   180.82095295116244
his eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and private a mission that could be confided only to a sure man and so has sent me to saint germain   105.08407288153407
in short at the moment in which she has just obtained from richelieu a carte blanche by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is d artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy botany bay some infamous tyburn of the indian ocean   141.94157867097576
one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her   88.55961326940051
see i have not slept said villefort showing his undisturbed bed   128.80128061295505
and in those times when other opportunities for investment were wanting such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare   91.94553490724894
it was necessary to reach m   109.41803749415854
at the first glance and by the joy which was painted on his countenance the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot   163.5419977686322
then you must not pay us   150.74957936293603
at the same moment mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at winter   131.07144968145107
repeated the curate who about as strong as d artagnan with respect to latin carefully watched the jesuit in order to keep step with him and repeated his words like an echo   100.47202125341978
shall you see him on your return monsieur count   81.56523518287237
had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said monte cristo i must believe on seeing you   28.729606116030553
to be a great chemist in the east one must direct chance   186.91680624086877
what art thou then   119.77442860297089
here i am my friends replied d artagnan   179.89045435355234
20041m that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman   220.62982525271855
it appeared likewise that mme   149.69546449886343
can all this force be summoned on my account   180.30549495693936
does monsieur le comte de la fere live here   81.22011687726317
it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government   85.20678929528741
so saying the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse   148.63272565897958
is your time then expired since i find you in a fair way to return there   29.221367977902972
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick   169.8232623252516
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered   162.20602001135396
certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them   117.90270067188688
for pity s sake   126.64804291948836
the second was to serve as the sleeping room for the servants the third under the prow of the ship was under the temporary cabin in which mordaunt was concealed   136.03326072417468
two or three times even to the great astonishment of his friends he had when aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him replaced a verb in its right tense and a noun in its case   154.85907814169002
are you still resolved to accompany me   147.55211950590902
at length it pointed to seven   163.79643959649596
whenever your majesty pleases   119.67732517862399
but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble lest i should not merit it   106.05224676092645
and where are you going   115.1431568541747
providence is now opposed to them when i most thought it would be propitious   108.0915239538895
what do you wish gentlemen   83.70577271332579
mercédès drew near and plucked the fruit   167.45132933069794
raoul bowed took the letter went hastily down the mountain leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop   147.91491474971556
no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling   101.72471839257918
what was the aim of that visit   70.04913561002577
it is one of my friends who loves her monsieur athos this gentleman here   134.9262552891832
there is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome   60.31706262557985
you are not thinking of mademoiselle danglars i hope   64.71276149622652
perhaps so replied d artagnan   116.84966313907991
this was a great matter in the way of honor but very little in the way of wealth   59.70417555917692
yes the rolling of a carriage   71.6920613341192
so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me   130.95610127248415
in the lucern patch chapter 58   96.62580464440676
then you think you will some day leave it   143.8267331601767
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of war   100.36403378259827
and you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble   136.38263676511852
and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards   167.57771238245903
hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain   77.91383089349236
a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand   131.16273281049993
he now determined not to begin the game with d artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary s cards   53.766601360064534
adieu athos i am going to raise an army   194.81055137036782
but my purse will be exhausted   78.0160276882278
well let it be three weeks then said morcerf   211.3756655751365
you are jesting   190.04995197770353
there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we can not have carriages   120.52658749764313
a good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass   127.04253412678821
asked patrick   64.10651493222181
the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car   94.48913107012021
sir said he here is monsieur d artagnan s answer   47.439195349611026
therefore mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really was   87.12808392840645
but she asked he in an undertone   68.80941940190769
for him those ten minutes were very long   107.85023634558937
i know nothing about it but i have heard say that he s not only an astrologer but a magician   162.3056050902896
and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair   112.04511621181321
yes true replied madame de villefort somewhat uneasily i remember now   258.18406236474294
my mistress above all repeated he mechanically   185.98072087270356
stay a moment your excellency said peppino rising   78.38574763466201
their return was cheerful   98.30194185073957
at nine o clock the contract is to be signed at my father in law s   54.27207226397669
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st   106.77939534331438
describe to me your abduction i pray you   179.77197565636612
ah traitor   179.5406756543132
i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them   125.19083331645459
they advanced to the plain   118.41625035669904
eh parbleu   98.0074045626807
i heard the name of rochefort   126.84214336819677
gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done   68.81892127670108
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good guitant   45.315645035926224
but why this question   41.36816295869788
and now madame try to make your peace with god for you are judged by men   137.45255891682226
this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph   134.2683000945775
you know he is almost dumb   135.93317305011576
21 in molière s comedy le misanthrope   108.9023684747279
we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening   53.90704272380291
only remember one thing a small dose is a remedy a large one is poison   151.24521066200245
when are you coming to the point   56.85981005869098
you are deceived madame said felton blushing   96.2268912550725
d artagnan s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion   7.285085744455884
said d artagnan mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso   157.66609113033877
exclaimed the commissary   155.9147062567793
did barrois make your lemonade   100.51722236731844
in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where d artagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where athos was to be   110.59659125925178
you see it is not my fault   86.66133609468578
it will be a nice little throat cutting   20.221235191770816
grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say   67.00914198725428
then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in lyons   198.0383715208123
is there any signal for the general rally   139.76251986069735
a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister   108.43780988060863
but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or looking indeed as if he had never seen them before   203.5299064164314
resumed porthos   175.04720253723406
but you will hear about him for la ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence   81.96981028372487
i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber and that i had found my way into the apartment of some churchman   85.90475888693354
it is a woman s voice cried aramis   174.57378905499615
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight   109.69261973402784
desire the french attendants not to weary her with questions but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire   61.646611239186555
the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done   96.56215744357772
why he was not altogether forsaken continued caderousse for mercédès the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him   72.36288603813057
with beauchamp   104.32100277716248
bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort   82.92260917643219
they both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition   67.66582268414545
said cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words   64.59493097916696
bonacieux with great emotion in my name i beg you   121.72577786515909
well for my part said athos i found aramis s spanish wine so good that i sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lackeys   159.51610173952184
yes skirmishers   195.18931191568208
monte cristo approached the window and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight   122.79030990525736
and he advanced to the window   140.4181596210023
madame said albert allow me to present to you m   110.38008560965783
the devil gentlemen   83.98790247295268
one thing i was sorry for   129.47840284759687
mutton every day   74.09156454643485
monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested   143.48698187014298
he was still young he was only four or five and twenty he had nearly fifty years to live   40.28343603964578
0137m in the first place and before everything else sir is the news as bad in your opinion as i am asked to believe   124.36175497189726
the woman especially was hideous   149.50055003804073
you will accompany monsieur le vicomte till grimaud rejoins you   132.98809897757573
well then i count on you   69.13500968279627
excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend   32.00145603849536
his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought   196.23406066286344
and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said i have no further need of you   87.4453102951429
to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him   102.0073673528392
poor lad   5.490506795403661
what say you morrel   39.38369807485195
poor kitty became as pale as death   162.8948539941527
these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity   46.85095271280471
no half confidence or you understand   83.42310206479742
it was situated in the via dei banchi near st   172.04577314219068
i am only temporarily a musketeer said aramis humbly   117.64813701558968
but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead   175.60975006724857
you are in captain rogers s post are you not   112.39263799674652
those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers   150.57788759560688
de tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the bosoms of his auditors   25.640098080810944
fernand dashed his on the ground   229.98045795014917
but what i know is that i will not be perjured   114.45939807307366
the conditions are favorable   88.45563326988923
the treasure i speak of really exists and i offer to sign an agreement with you in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig   74.44532209543272
said d artagnan can she have charged you to tell me so   80.03002590067914
meditate and consider as much as you like replied porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn   70.80025303492664
a bad sign to find the door open   119.6938088331901
oh merely a paltry fifty louis   61.04328153646523
athos my friend   153.3896474014109
this cursed rolling   216.31404163853426
i fancied it was so   177.47667899429328
i will keep twenty to hold in check the mob   99.76675448777216
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses   80.11565038360469
bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits   139.66061407134106
it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost me well somewhere about 30 000 francs   109.4851299541532
and this room   131.05442512153232
i always had a desire to have a mute in my service so learning the day his tongue was cut out i went to the bey and proposed to give him for ali a splendid double barreled gun which i knew he was very desirous of having   139.63567145566515
but she declined availing herself of it   183.50789029108228
mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it   71.13947968336156
they will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it   82.81013958048074
but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly   87.53733117423906
host said he could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy for me   169.03630417998318
athos s idea   110.83021036715002
first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money   165.30793682724644
d épinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty   92.88791326440692
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away   96.95573710137802
why the doctors called his complaint gastro enteritis i believe   79.05731502649303
caderousse smiled bitterly   130.77958236282342
the son of marie michon   89.8915086653787
then sell out sell out marquis or you will lose it all   148.42888247879327
they demanded 6 000 francs   104.68615266269961
they reached the queen s apartments but were compelled to stop in the ante chamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from england   190.50930766689092
ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the mantle piece and the shelves i have not got any candles   151.8993420163363
no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed   24.48361949380785
he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon   105.86849797075807
in that case said mazarin i think it must please me best to remain   185.3320330642996
for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished   93.19940133420461
you are the directors of all consciences   147.22786855669165
cried d artagnan another twenty pistoles lost   155.17476818063216
for when we do not owe them money we owe them gratitude   148.0700155592546
i have just killed an old friend   92.33138338294908
ah he s gone to blois   134.76381954018237
now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that i have a wife and four children   137.2306322511573
her arms bare to the elbow brown and modelled after those of the arlesian venus moved with a kind of restless impatience and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her well turned leg in its red cotton gray and blue clocked stocking   88.05774017211648
wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register   94.41788454639426
by bonaparte or at least by his adherents   122.69526787860624
inquired the baroness   102.10424746165701
de blacas will go and find my messenger   170.97369119359468
however i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger   134.97123866618665
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar   134.39694161260556
i have always heard how cheap poultry is in italy   102.72781176503247
well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and i may believe it in every particular   105.16414695339255
athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while m   127.02735079443778
this idea occurred to me and did not leave me   133.66924896490028
he had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher pain thou art not an evil   49.72775706895081
i know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and i am brave also   91.63679829257651
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach   152.0332606414601
the woman one loves is holy   87.23014732065936
all at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers   90.17316075776051
ah it is you monsieur   163.92968306915571
why he is surrounded by sultanas like a turk   58.17235894251709
is it not worth 300 000 francs to save our father s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure   63.123527280827915
can you believe so   62.91496250200146
the moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds   111.73961144096309
the chief marched at the head   109.66274912392615
well then said dantès what shall you teach me first   119.74465812835757
his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night   138.66745885678355
i will see her d artagnan   119.54921177145069
there was but one tavern the post   139.29886214785407
to your apartments perhaps   82.74220500302326
they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber   92.01403623494863
the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time   229.74911929502014
but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envy will they go under a man s hat like the one i see down there   63.802447798195544
i am calculating by the way morcerf that indirectly concerns you i am calculating what the house of danglars must have gained by the last rise in haiti bonds   91.89245856464674
just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to bertuccio said excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner   138.65485013293303
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon   136.8815456151847
replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet   69.03704786732214
and i set fire to the villa san felice to procure a wedding dress for my betrothed   115.81346719818872
she terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation   135.06107412144007
is our little neighbor worse   97.21387028512862
you are therefore your own master till seven o clock in the evening   123.62818503029632
so added madame de villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the borgias the medicis the renées the ruggieris and later probably that of baron de trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count   127.22165484132202
are you really frightened madame   64.46198400194524
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure   132.04929665352049
your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba and have deceived us   115.95764954298603
fortune is a courtesan   158.00682065066277
then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living   18.243605989067262
you wish it you are inflexible   77.77583709987275
well what is the matter my dear   98.56891438844194
it was assunta calling for help   95.21343434729472
slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo   130.76337410223908
what capital   97.02808276774103
come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m   128.8348048700826
they have selected a field of battle on which i am an abler general than they that of a conference   113.03866490615601
d artagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation   130.90224574423507
but today i wish to nurse you carefully   117.26163956558791
they are costumes of battle   64.591618095418
stop a minute answered caderousse   178.84759320177972
have you proof of this   105.66380420362167
let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off   83.53070566526779
sire said blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me   116.67852372134668
what letter   134.7971525048184
said monte cristo starting   67.30943642923714
today is the twentieth of september   84.01135118386034
the count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred   110.6863547992438
not a second was to be lost   99.11483893342536
why you see no one knows what may happen   100.82484612565172
but athos being warned of his coming went into the other chamber   125.32902382611337
yes sir replied the englishman   68.74904846047727
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features   80.83657780268729
and he will be guillotined will he not   61.48498076539779
heyday madame   49.55511541125388
by your glorious father and by yourself whom i love and venerate above all the world i swear it   62.60381969701964
but still we can make sure that they are so   80.45767334828628
he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when planchet approached and said i will lay a wager your honor that you and i are thinking of the same thing   126.99469122935515
and far from being incredulous mazarin was superstitious   147.84063306396587
enough enough   128.08380638669405
he fought like a furious tiger turning ten times round his adversary and changing his ground and his guard twenty times   122.14723601608131
go to the riverside ask for the brig sund and give this letter to the captain   63.685147826529615
the scheme goes forward it seems   138.63954599886029
this was neither long nor difficult   108.02598671915297
sulpice or from the rue du vieux colombier to the luxembourg   81.1693640462079
you are now master of england   176.03148288831153
de tréville and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies from the lawyer s dame to the baroness there was question of nothing less with porthos than a foreign princess who was enormously fond of him   89.4434793963808
when he came here monsieur d artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order i suppose to have his sword back   96.42290932983397
you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz   74.70321710294103
cried d artagnan they re coming toward us   112.45698365398539
she counted two then five then eight horsemen   102.15597429675336
do gentlemen then make verses   130.84850956109614
27 rue du helder 21st may half past ten in the morning   47.248350897022206
you are fastidious château renaud replied debray   147.73892144771622
franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said   164.98827475269636
the cousin was received with resignation that was all   100.06161891217246
i often think of that young man d artagnan   142.58401603854242
vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks   77.14218369132664
now leave us alone mr   122.23178524048463
debray was not yet come but albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera   182.0883746092883
the word is too mild   118.13753982018379
replied planchet recurring to his besetting idea that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips   71.21467580733339
sdeath   64.28484925747784
well over that coach house are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments   95.22607483234628
these people who are looking at us are only merchants said athos and are looking more at the cargo than at us   32.58790315298532
during this time dantès at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests   120.32836861320921
do you not see how she suffers   148.56069478241056
does the letter contain anything valuable   136.68018147184762
d artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips   36.919150541982034
the prisoners   133.59599711889334
i never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half   177.6397982239774
oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holiness s castle   165.4957605060215
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate   158.86114643348674
his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness   119.92174748457924
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to wait   97.83038174569873
and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king   96.00535665530685
d avrigny took the priest s hand and without meeting villefort who was engaged in his study they reached valentine s room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers   118.80072888267544
château renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coupé joined him   162.26148680585197
this was m   64.05139351301406
it is the uniform of the cardinal s guards   109.4157045778512
doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were out   66.07488131592918
but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw albert disappear arm in arm with the peasant girl   174.88853118291115
she gave it me last night   17.918427756903085
the jury took their seats   157.75136755858136
at this moment and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached   78.39463551789044
but the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire   80.45269399916094
on their side from time to time the besiegers took the messengers which the rochellais sent to buckingham or the spies which buckingham sent to the rochellais   129.93939011398444
no sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said madame de villefort   36.24842586930795
why should you expose your game to your adversary   107.64719097518069
my friends will submit them   181.01656955647937
20111m cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares   123.8729868604101
resumed the gascon   182.2076678187953
in case any evil should happen to me said bragelonne   91.602461974476
do not prolong my punishment   84.0269334374659
for in truth i think i have hitherto been deceived in you   127.5908838718121
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago   154.4034116125681
i am quite familiar with it   132.2460108780753
he will become so monsieur   59.33467087968744
albert placed it in his button hole and the carriage went triumphantly on   81.26828431955892
i was still unable to divine for what reason m   146.62935145472886
and would you believe it count believe what   131.37749454471623
and what have master pastrycooks to do with us   189.27231780607195
0191m the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dantès plate and dantès after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day   92.06950149348934
be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for you for you as aramis   133.11486681523473
noirtier s expression could not be understood   97.54119397160525
and while the three musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him   125.51431092471893
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling   171.30801141917237
and as his servant i will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart   124.08990977508279
the notary then prepared to retire   192.45232192372697
he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests   76.03414877658251
thrice for my steward thus i do not waste a minute or a word   109.54776063340942
but it will break his heart   118.0954628270119
doubtless but not in the same way   84.6880775674642
i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression   88.66941118766565
d artagnan then only half lied which is lying but little when he said that by going in search of milady he at the same time went in search of constance   183.72652478575574
with all my heart replied the marquise   95.08392230232624
eh sir   167.2579781488813
but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her this reply ready arranged presented itself to her lips i   91.16812589809885
then he added softly with an avaricious smile i came to touch   28.588712707164248
this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation   131.26097937580343
tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul   99.5613972089366
monsieur d artagnan you are a great wit and i am really sorry to be on bad terms with you   38.49620325597854
felton and you will have saved my honor   74.14970183801307
some churchmen some bankers   160.9464107212325
de tréville looking earnestly at d artagnan   72.82795242124185
i swear it before the god who hears me   55.518284108993036
eh your excellency   193.7647925222043
that s a charming spot for such amusements as the one i propose to you   164.87755726856616
are you also the victim of a treachery   143.39564374355672
it is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty   84.17284063937836
a woman with athos   162.16995328407737
inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these words from lord ruthven to countess g   76.95813608989648
but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight   113.64983603015851
athos stretched out his hand toward her   80.68817383598133
a name   124.09589161396123
morrel s apartment   139.28892317619477
but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages   166.67678421577918
the second to avert the death of a great king   112.47388606787182
do you think you can help me dear grandpapa   101.08236903514383
in the chamber overhead   133.02023400140058
it was captain leclere who gave orders for this delay   141.41009969739898
then d artagnan became almost wild   223.05112823445478
and madame de morcerf to your dinner   38.79584898652095
why you are like no   60.28794872195701
then turning to mazarin he said now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to heaven for your deliverance   195.66601745500512
felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed   112.19229006637359
the court of saint bernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests   187.06464215664346
a deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to paris   106.31515477419981
let s wait for grimaud   102.54728706968196
all four once more together   71.36198945872732
maximilian maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a christian   143.33355438152043
but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper   22.843604357098613
and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour   138.0950486816167
i staked on him   139.84330328088117
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know   149.59044433718464
then he began to doubt his own innocence which justified in some measure the governor s belief in his mental alienation   94.01300566124851
the closet into which d artagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see   192.47042660005076
so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields   152.21985618236621
mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini   52.641120028453116
then i must die like a common criminal by the hand of the london executioner   157.71296357215093
from being slender he had now become meagre   102.44460877831706
do you not recognize me unhappy child   139.14545736272845
it is not that which deterred me replied monte cristo   117.10784361372916
on the first day of that month our four companions had landed at boulogne and in two parties had set out for paris   107.52121299606523
for i am low very low   59.71693529124588

pyramus and thisbe about two thirds of the way along the faubourg saint honoré and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large garden where the wide spreading chestnut trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate that dated from the time of louis xiii   97.77721997081204
very well said milady   97.62959457288824
in addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous he has received another right through his lungs of which the doctor says bad things   192.82241428981192
people went there in crowds   151.28275595653636
repeated the agitated mother   188.54293368591655
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning   87.75006779059945
which the duchess de chevreuse or the duchess de longueville   61.360852932583605
you are indeed a nobleman   68.46721579073336
the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man s face   60.630364530951546
very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him   32.702629583646214
i have accustomed myself to regard you as my son well then to save my son i will sacrifice my life nay even my fortune   173.16489487241734
thus tis quite decided said d artagnan that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you   76.8826026700938
she said at length do you not answer me   87.02000293913977
monte cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed a grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean an atom in the infinite   110.04974764380087
echoed de guiche   10.696575472455478
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another   91.69567818759838
in twenty minutes they were at auteuil   147.62045517216276
then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise   177.58790679540013
but said the count so great was ali pasha s confidence that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care   169.4990674816844
i do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of september   152.7074917730295
i returned to the seminary   137.48663210728205
exactly what i wish for   151.96788348031126
la ramee stretched out his legs grimaud took a table cloth tore it into strips and tied la ramee s feet together   95.1107655269243
you do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently   136.28652554954783
you would bring me good luck and i should become rich   153.76295968379978
he has   116.78444630072168
take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing room said the viscount   77.54122392116577
it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of henry iv   111.43981257439609
i have distrusted god   79.25433013809118
thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it in   85.82942206690697
now sir said madame de villefort i must bid you farewell   178.83468295864822
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers   93.39841193031127
but man on the contrary loathes the idea of blood it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life   128.3769983960775
it was the duc de beaufort who was coming from the vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the parisians intoxicated with joy   106.88573311927219
oh i shall not cried franz   121.8840518498291
and the next day bernajoux   127.03939822973682
i should say no   130.601438070787
baptistin bowed low   96.86162851233338
suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment   165.9391874187957
you re wrong   82.18819664698577
they ascended five or six more steps and then dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro   246.85055521374204
so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day i beg of you   91.11104656744239
come and let me tell you that you are the prettiest soubrette i ever saw   9.497504578087671
in the morning felton came as usual   89.97843876808915
and i said the coadjutor want it to be thought that i do not speak to him   124.798478134093
but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them   113.0179843561781
let us not mistake said monte cristo   112.75744088149511
well then look at m   136.89475899021986
danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart   121.90564218531628
you command us my lord to do so   107.62427965484594
i dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt   170.42403630428623
because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a corsican s nature to revenge himself   155.810975895125
order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the holsters   64.53271779573112
carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened   180.15467688306177
she had still her nymph like form so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped with anne of austria over the moat of the tuileries in 1563   89.6540737934005
why said porthos that was very good of him it seems to me   117.66493030574249
therefore go and collect your fifty men and hold yourself in readiness   155.45916078502114
and what friends awaited him without   119.26145543348328
said franz calculating the chances of peril   95.2956759626698
in four days time the shore will be beneath your feet the sea will be open to you more open than will perhaps be agreeable to you for in four days england will be relieved of you   53.93070290445682
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners   197.05571765883224
he didn t predict the future he knew the past often a more dangerous thing   105.05432322850776
oh it is no trouble to spend that   174.07740110810715
that is one more than m   57.762793874286224
he came from marseilles where he had been deputy procureur   134.6317979088773
noirtier regarded his daughter in law with the look of a man desiring an explanation   21.5626273458694
good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught   92.1346652191268
danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed   63.54225287306858
at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank   62.53738039041535
i am choking   158.61276523029292
athos therefore commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner   127.27290079508376
no madame i have not   113.04497747650011
but i don t want your arm at all   59.35732122410366
young man said richelieu if i shall be able to say to you at another time what i have said to you today i promise you to do so   111.37013956765158
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose   176.28177161838877
but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary   75.86311122129109
here father here   132.29362359077018
he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm   106.93543381272141
a horse for which château renaud offered you four hundred louis and which you would not part with   14.036255720306414
and these judges i warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike   33.89869533092127
the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded   21.836149763070495
i forgot that i was hercules and you only the pale omphale   36.349074769252866
yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty hogsheads   95.61444134061966
in the morning when they entered milady s chamber they had brought her breakfast   152.43028995639415
it was three o clock when he threw himself on the bed   103.83126478121225
twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from rueil to saint germain twenty are dispersed in the woods   50.822983754398734
exclaimed raoul here you are at last   64.28830373713603
all the rest of the square was paved with heads   149.6882577246305
and you followed the business of a tailor   106.63631717249862
and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own   37.88610466287078
on the contrary i esteem them but will not have them   32.47059868612473
the carriage was upset the horses carried off stifled mangled by the crowd   167.49497102902947
i perhaps may leave my life in it for although it may be strange i have for some time had a presentiment that i should shortly die   100.47971631454075
completely so   129.10119407892512
bazin my friend said aramis you don t seem to be aware that i can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all i have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation   120.90064443483107
what had become of him he cared not to inquire   105.47138057051258
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said d artagnan shaking his head   69.90921823965783
mademoiselle danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes   71.76470532695717
blacas is not yet convinced   144.56602214134313
30341m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated   173.04393212648625
we need only a week to amend all that   154.67638971772075
he is here and here said she touching her eyes and her heart   149.30461034471557
the agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of groslow who at the hour fixed by mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors   90.82767371640482
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering   140.8860388777219
no the sacrifice returned château renaud   61.169429660923136
and she had signed it   229.93098811921544
it seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined   77.96287857360568
the executioner in short   146.35552689744517
fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils said but if he is dead if he is dead i shall die too   116.7130566762553
such as were only beautiful gave their beauty whence without doubt comes the proverb the most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has   186.52212695701272
the departure chapter 113   157.2766095150107
what a life i cause you to lead poor maximilian you who are formed for happiness   100.05288751826492
you don t know him perhaps but i know him   79.04895380124849
when once in the bastille there is no afterward   66.28703820981505
monsieur i love men of your kidney   133.5020940606271
beyond that hedge that garden and that cottage a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where paris slept a vast void from which glittered a few luminous points the funeral stars of that hell   58.28278078248415
why i am ready to tell everything cried bonacieux at least all that i know   180.30973333585047
seven o clock in the morning   146.0835865975165
go to selim   90.18394643646822
replied d avrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness   127.90371032780862
i should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a boy   57.82503616927096
the man whose house you have just left   161.25723767647509
a good animal whose paces suit me   92.00684708802595
somebody said to me you are monsieur d artagnan   143.33021759418685
felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand   181.55427375468577
said d artagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   105.53262638849857
i who am going to give you another piece of good advice   161.410247364655
the host recognized him   78.43472437703775
she must have spoken   195.22397601308796
i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron   137.4892324584333
i felt instinctively that someone approached me   10.916781074497095
no i would rather die   110.06332250245713
i know him now   153.89908214055788
mordaunt followed bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out   151.8505506439401
then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in vain   103.90908382399824
tell me how tréville you know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting   174.6769369119802
he is my master and i am his slave   81.16546744379602
he conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks   69.37046074497762
albert turned   198.61352941734646
go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety   239.54350173060712
mazarin wished to approach her   101.89432058524451
all replied mordaunt   106.90191432918894
to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners   119.0585177713876
i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you   212.86810142094032
i would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the bastile   78.74038236915878
why we must inquire into that was caderousse s reply   82.7662182139336
i know nothing about it   134.47212078936803
in turning the corner of the rue montmartre in order to reach the rue tiquetonne and the hotel de la chevrette where he had appointed porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in a sky blue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth   61.05557787267027
i was about to say to these gentlemen added he that i forbid my musketeers to expose their lives needlessly   123.1012767896012
i understand said athos smiling midnight   205.54387900725393
who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his life s best happiest years   119.63921458525951
ali obeyed leaving the abbé alone with caderousse who had not yet revived   113.60421109378015
you are in a hurry captain   116.98204631742142
everything was as athos had foreseen   23.09091127569927
an inveterate bonapartist   67.92520209637082
was his second thought   151.32654257319297
but i pray you go away from that plane tree   147.52208237775537
he is all powerful even with the king   154.10305911792017
a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and dantès was arrested   66.21816751084205
and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce it   102.96967095152311
and those gendarmes behaved shamefully   155.19817948650373
that is forbidden it seems to me   63.662786333531685
i will but go and return sire   141.97945617234748
walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late   78.41943360028893
answered porthos behold other players appear   110.55532728920689
why said dantès if in two or three days you hail any fishing boat desire them to come here to me   55.68106485298945
the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones   109.61763471500349
d artagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause   102.8552615089864
indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration   140.06414200479216
very well monsieur mordaunt said mazarin give me this second letter and sit down   138.9847353462036
her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her   120.56643578327972
sixty thousand francs per year   101.32085340208515
besides what would it be to them   79.3287789172467
she will ruin us   147.77259615691182
her lover   147.54933610796976
yes said she it is madame danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us   127.85691027024488
is that your name monsieur   177.9406444149755
said danglars becoming pale   175.13644707112365
when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them   58.40152472582535
will you not even say you will see me again   114.93835309182342
but if we do risk being killed said porthos at least i should like to know what for   84.1714526132488
danglars gave 16 000 francs for his horses   43.50641364451546
that is he   95.85570151280135
no take a more stylish horse phoebus or superbe   161.5809623017176
really you pain me   133.08734817141112
i do not recollect it said haydée   87.42173460610327
that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonder for whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that richelieu was great   69.55731024573633
i am a friend of the count s   43.684491161845216
morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder   64.52074689718187
bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this bag   139.80702180729836
well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp château renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast   60.42620424138035
be satisfied replied bonacieux   94.29034627080007
and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught   96.1586452125959
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis   121.50286536836649
ask day after to morrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle and who is no other than noirmont your former maitre d hotel   177.4530968308256
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow   125.82381270059386
what does he say   83.0498061074215
would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth   149.10479228048376
we are near athos s door   79.81167967017365
you have no other   105.7892115195504
a merry morning to you sunshine   132.9545169285082
let them say what they will   122.92530676466258
three of the king s musketeers   85.05756704836415
richelieu knew that in combating england he combated buckingham   172.4563967718981
luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the roman peasant at holiday time   198.19988616294597
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerf s when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort   62.60479122729899
i say sire that there is now but one way open   63.39239715340091
my first husband   159.911032404038
cried morrel turning pale what is it   50.23860911756648
but you began a sentence sir and did not finish   64.65986502721663
as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his peas   112.43737352531346
alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my stepmother s aversion to me arises from a very natural source her overweening love for her own child my brother edward   80.39648265741863
yours affectionate de tréville well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me athos   177.95661551422157
uniform cross knee breeches   92.72682340562396
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven   119.12337263639847
let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of it   79.60251626917635
and he glanced timidly at the count s blue coat   99.82203729912104
with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started alarmed and blaisois was near fainting from fright   94.4714501795118
then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper   61.15989827983715
shouted athos with all the power of his lungs   157.8112179991798
i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count if he were a real count he wouldn t be so rich   125.10720257278939
and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master   136.55362822711146
madame danglars is ill said villefort   121.84220982544376
yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the minister s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700 000 francs   68.92896668583072
on the contrary observed d artagnan with a vexed look   53.719520738240725
made a peer at the restoration i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal bourmont   97.55810797245923
no it is useless   93.88797939481465
but who then is andrea cavalcanti   101.40957874094543
he was unable to write sir   164.6601294415658
hope is so sweet a comforter   132.8742000180742
how many covers   154.34299369095032
one can easily see it comes from a priest   55.07677667285468
he strictly followed the instructions he had received   41.88523045456297
bertuccio said the count   135.35279573616342
i shall become worthy of her gratitude   49.466543286765386
d artagnan rushed out of the room   171.9050349893449
as franz was about to take leave of m   113.43276063509204
he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener   29.643482661429104
the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it   27.212822523930797
suddenly about nine o clock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying   65.17916774310476
you had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse   79.409321528325
impossible said madame de villefort   148.36279701339203
safe and sound as true as my name s jack butler   166.23180614761827
ah but the valise i want cried porthos is a well filled one my dear   67.7380983172938
no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body   118.5038025648581
said athos in so stifled a voice that d artagnan scarcely heard him   100.08714439233165
oh my god my god i thank thee   139.19059538119535
it contained half a line in a hand perfectly british and with a conciseness as perfectly spartan thank you   88.75147707162832
the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but napoleon returned a special levy was made and fernand was compelled to join   124.02957422899931
de monte cristo receives my apology   123.75018960406695
these young fellows can none of them drink said athos looking at him with pity and yet this is one of the best   105.67122226044924
our former life has it still no attractions for you   50.806136898742295
i can work then   87.18269385253717
i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man   64.24835186265771
danglars raving threw himself on the goat skin   114.19809168120901
tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton   119.1549157087335
she signed a patent   140.9080748948734
thank you sir answered the young man much moved   31.256573868138744
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber   150.7755020345517
could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coiners say   108.56009183267402
in getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at court   71.51153221010955
she had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor   20.596509252900447
it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which villefort left the palais   145.33959555460828
he murmured and fell with his face to the ground   127.43667894910955
we will do the same   111.39547173269851
something like a smile was perceptible on madame de villefort s countenance   175.1162928673856
now then to play another master stroke by which i shall gain the heart of both husband and wife delightful   138.4650844425236
but he had scarcely left before danglars with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frédérick 24 exclaimed fool   86.90961482975554
in that case i am lost said d artagnan   144.518878618398
monsieur d artagnan said athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman   152.31098358092692
his servant   47.14293013469758
this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer   129.11157402905272
listen valentine   119.46956012980552
the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner   140.11866375941986
morrel shook his head sorrowfully   141.8129303397159
madame these are my orders   205.4519018424972
i don t think so   77.01806829005795
the next day they indeed left accompanied only by baptistin   83.71403939308973
monsieur bonacieux said the commissary looking at the accused as if his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts you have a wife   118.52013641701114
i will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and calais   163.9507773969155
ah danglars   176.8348511995669
why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him   86.27845965847357
i do not therefore wish either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause   125.07651468588799
cries of down with mazarin   155.9896049088081
to give your majesty s reply to those who await it   152.91220874581566
and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans   175.16716251762438
replied one of the horsemen   93.39593250404214
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy   156.31786483218414
said the baroness smiling   106.61744229415127
well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a gift   112.97833586509488
you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me   260.4855531682666
with which you are at war is it not so   110.43887681621014
peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges   165.33715263915332
the result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind   94.9123422040532
dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much   147.906557801457
dantès was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead   158.9272148800726
and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him   60.3390869941192
the anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer in spite of his efforts to suppress it terrified his sensitive inamorata   157.89542968630303
there was a great press of people in m   51.00929431828661
and i have but one scruple that of leaving my dear grandmother s remains which i had undertaken to watch   43.981292807307156
let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog   158.83377125098286
persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldn t have too much information   116.72937611416585
i will appeal to any of these gentlemen could i leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him   136.94324247011468
and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant   99.78868473943385
as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach   118.89645602950705
treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated   115.60012321260332
grimaud nodded assent   136.7254346954674
and what is more and she held out her hand to him i restore my love   152.554269338159
mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me replied morcerf and that frightens me   167.9152859163201
but remorse is not thus banished   177.94226865747888
nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over   129.68052594103173
on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the hôtel de londres   21.009695252471147
on your honor   136.3116260679567
mercédès lives sir and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your voice edmond by the simple sound of your voice   145.14499409911826
he was of middle height   101.51835735082734
on the capture of charles stuart   166.23136580557258
i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure   106.16241567544327
but it was my husband who would not hear of lending   97.83424290028402
as you see my health is but indifferent   118.67910251703618
france refuse hospitality to an unfortunate prince   135.4522389802462
well this surprises me for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs   177.4409586774039
the sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the south east they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world   118.95052468314958
they are these   174.56556305121936
porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room   114.76903175474476
however raoul must be diverted from this fancy   52.4721894160331
i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him   191.39345752705
we are always in a hurry to be happy m   174.07254801177842
morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on the garden soon found the spot where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him   113.79371769525727
farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously   99.5999390365734
you are gentleman enough not to listen standing   105.99362877827947
gentlemen he said the wood that i am carting is his   72.53785243334917
come d artagnan don t let us play a sidelong game   72.07541175667457
danglars uttered a cry and fell prostrate   149.43244223894158
porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of d artagnan and his yellow horse   159.99261070238367
and you understand heraldry   137.6899819664741
possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about d artagnan immediately   50.10369958378506
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged   90.50755484793973
upon gaining this advantage d artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise   76.4667256766079
athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the half curtains closely drawn   151.38888428191103
yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin   127.1476038952954
so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the 21st of february   91.59210843417577
what is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death   10.150300948877728
you know that is never refused among neighbors   25.035134767660495
his visitor appeared slightly uneasy   94.03511618002301
morrel comes to aid me   95.48382122270823
i am a victim of the cardinal   131.91398317856556
the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the nave   135.73196587072394
they saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed   179.00109595769212
it appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush   92.47362318078599
where will it take me   93.96783293702426
all this time the soldiers were calling out stop   107.00787861657336
notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of monte cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile andrea seized the count s hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared   155.07499424417836
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes   162.41245581753623
then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist   94.91972851953523
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps   79.66957818073926
one moment my lord whispered athos and he said something in a low voice   142.6104478856754
why how could you make such a mistake such an old stager   173.07977654743434
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot   112.29344057260538
by a banker of paris my correspondent   76.04233929347971
i never believe in anything i have not seen and as i never have seen apparitions i don t believe in them   111.04840751577206
but what ails you father   139.52734376776777
to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels   109.91615365434178
you are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them can act with energy such was cardinal richelieu s opinion my lord   173.3855650719873
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit   36.46525102103162
yes it was about stop a minute yes it was about a woman   114.84151218455824
it was empty   109.4320625981341
yes count said milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met   117.70272914561247
alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe   109.5970929526383
retorted la carconte   86.58194929462
i think not sir replied m   157.04235383146363
the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count s visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders   136.407214034904
let us return with renewed strength to the battle field and i promise you 500 000 soldiers another marengo and a second austerlitz   102.58950633510798
opening the door of communication passed into the corridor which led from his apartments to those of anne of austria   119.07196782099692

madame morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing   77.29776380684332
he had dark sparkling and deep set eyes hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal   188.777376675291
the adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other not that m   134.18805920193822
but these advances could not go far with three musketeers who were already much in arrears and a guardsman who as yet had no pay at all   6.8161742063482365
he asked of groslow   76.58885035589981

coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment   167.09760270108535
it is arranged capitally   170.0513555201502
grimaud repeated the sign   164.50322391007967
your mission is not accomplished   94.4450021549843
exclaimed baptistin eagerly   122.09553368244019
he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune   118.54951950826971
he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnères luchon and cauterets   104.57583216582051
i myself came to paris with four crowns in my purse and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me i was not in a condition to purchase the louvre   108.95966267636007
cocles opened the gate and baptistin springing from the box inquired whether monsieur and madame herbault and monsieur maximilian morrel would see his excellency the count of monte cristo   104.2718038527015
very true   93.5920679271174

when we have a fog   123.12593759148893
they arrived at ablain without accident   202.3164301467594
and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade   82.3779845126556
denis or in the fair of st   157.46976518693526
let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void   101.43865275879523
the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness   95.09443462130004
was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercédès   105.45935440536402
caderousse started and turned pale   195.0703851892752
and again long live the parliament   66.52516925354635
how did you fare   71.65737261494436

anne reclining in a large easy chair her head supported by her hand her elbow resting on a table was looking at her son who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures   52.1858964937412
athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities   162.3183727260229
then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray   100.55026999684554
bring it to me or rather no no   85.0149758088349
this was all that milady could endure   104.28059199354885
no madame replied raoul   109.0960183706854
the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else   108.99352771346864
as to that you must leave it to me   101.67479292090977
noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence   187.05781457161865
you will supply the want of the evening papers   155.43979153785153
what the count said was true the most curious spectacle in life is that of death   40.01002599112452
to let me sail first   170.7197734691081
eh he said negligently this money is not mine   93.71108820424381
he was immediately recognized as one of them   143.18200712408276
you are now sanguinary   107.34969133977515
replied danglars   106.4624019080729
here i am in the heart of paris   117.9519472122345
said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened   109.59422738991825
repair your crimes toward her   202.28341193857568
i do not know what m   127.64218885210413
monte cristo lets fall his purse   58.81163373373379
anxiety carried him on further   129.20374590448756
laughing   102.30885599367716
i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger   136.69203148466414
ried in a place he knows and has visited with me that is in   10.76927525138953
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction   134.09953192252803
the latter to make a short cut had appeared on a sluice   145.611322923622
lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty third and it was now the morning of the twenty second   171.17725966264877
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else   159.99327099819416
your turn my lord said athos   185.23546685969478
the uniform of the king s musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns   134.20021690074313
he remained listening and gazing   78.79040182385589
at all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some one at once to write to me   9.574870237441402
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying   133.4707958752749
in the meantime d artagnan was defiling with his company   67.54198004717344
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him   117.76236520719854
the friend of my greatest foes   43.62039467654235
till then   129.53356578376756
not very much said d artagnan   89.11654722749986
he cried or you are a dead man   132.8231638990658
it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom   126.69229031349333
it is the will of god   158.18866879084277
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street   161.82414847145367
read for yourself and judge   107.04895454591986
that is possible go   134.66121293442322
grimaud begins his functions   97.67590503473846
he was a man of uncommonly sound sense   80.36151971093499
and more especially a notorious coward   129.46621146417925
noirtier for whom france was a vast chess board from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was checkmated m   79.08166671197999
as fast as they entered they were placed in the grand saloon on the platforms prepared for them   131.97769731407055
cried mordaunt springing off his horse   135.40309683299327
he was carried home in the arms of the people   117.37043170700461
look behind this wall said de comminges knocking against the wall   120.9768277330691
i stumbled over some object   74.69522206669166
and you say he is dressed as a monk grimaud   46.71418929304903
said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold   124.85260431792312
thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger   81.88893558530032
did it belong to m   119.54640316273071
danglars be there   107.36202220415308
oh misery cried franz the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father   69.63749734187454
it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france   95.48115827774011
i have nothing but what my sword brings me in that is to say more blows than banknotes   72.23519124411513
cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it   143.71698884957755
do you say resumed d artagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman   93.30967201499064
the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance   77.79054053910653
poverty overtook you   153.27209872062036
your pardon madame i know all that   185.60185637495096
these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused   8.046163272904735
means for classical tragedy chapter lviii   127.36517218169396
faria smiled   117.54908970367124
danglars bowed assentingly   58.732447594882245
we have no time to lose   140.7210530334449
at this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already   41.753007652060546
who is this groslow   120.7982924197189
his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred   168.36351760260072
behold nebuchadnezzar   115.10716517023474
the queen touched with her lips the white smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette   124.5959312334014
he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell   160.73064227415392
count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the rospoli palace   102.70463176664603
everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination   107.71586280975572
at this moment the clock struck six   101.10848364724855
if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame   109.22631442697613
at that instant the little side gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared   147.29750037771288
it is you who stabbed selim   152.70825018028432
come come fernand said caderousse hold up your head and answer us   101.99993589472096
but at any rate you know where he is monsieur d artagnan   139.2144179849828
this he said to planchet must be the archbishop s chateau the abode of the fair madame de longueville   117.20436662540469
be easy on that score m   68.56603022857918
the moment that d artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity   111.58012277055148
the suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of d artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket   108.79478085352741
i am free as a bird and have wings like one   92.48118621365691
explain yourself then   64.62427518789005
cried the two musketeers   117.84168890717636
this was the departure of fernand of fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her brother   105.64953528286176
yes that first and other things afterward   113.0497414121018
and your two other friends   103.50075396501941
then if he persists notwithstanding all this as that is as i have said the limit of my mission i shall have nothing to do but to pray god to work a miracle for the salvation of france   180.9225571636964
come my friend come let me embrace you   62.874710246589956
by my troth yes   148.13408782793735
the fêtes are veritable pleasure days to the italians   126.33755312879892
resounded from all parts and was death to mazarin s ears   141.79265928106537
ah your excellency i am overwhelmed with delight   91.53938065247998
i do not know him viscount   70.28371671177968
what is past is past   117.84039664741293
it was the first time he had ever met a similar client   157.71565148528637
well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil   105.15251491024375
the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare   12.646298159757208
lover and husband ah madame said d artagnan entering by the door which the young woman opened for him allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a husband   28.12198504907269
wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones stick out   131.76228326925943
my sleep then must have lasted twenty four hours   93.05482098713152
danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied   64.39572191902315
the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo   144.6587430063972
i went to him and told him all   144.41919744862707
it is the first time then that you ever went to that house   132.36417860727596
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him   138.50399855796095
but first barricade the first door well   97.57791342987272
the young men bowed and quitted the box   57.13116570667366
continued milady   58.43726594736737
but as good luck would have it just as i thought i should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken leg   168.0810967934909
monsieur said the old man ask me nothing   112.24011445961911
justice has its formalities   105.52968198445744
the company was then heard departing   145.42991831193905
he traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and re embarked for marciana   75.42205445799866
but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow   103.66895292842455
villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others   95.3682920481885
he saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance   217.47186627036126
i will efface that blot on my father s character   115.4573504676258
from the abbé busoni   173.19747146679924
if only they close the guardhouse door   63.76362375327663
on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air   11.548960730079614
and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season   178.82638330339296
here is a creature that loves me   75.27029507507149
let us examine the enemy s army   97.29756280637672
to answer you would be to forget it   60.646180770183136
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light   76.92858848209022
it is my master s ring   32.34655008328929
whether queens or not they are always the same   115.6493735137181
ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor   86.40301106473272
doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath   41.30189459256344
he saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery   138.185700356354
it is no nonsense   58.35512239666294
take a cigar   93.30253681727977
spur spur   159.54133245250344
he has been a soldier a smuggler in fact everything   115.48304282461874
i do not reproach you athos for what you have done   105.0474700549204
a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation   140.6812622565808
there is certainly some magic underneath   136.1168876833022
cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause   74.45953859327673
morrel had thought of danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth   215.86537163232043
here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores   191.7859943071017
we can chat better in doors and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation   147.9587526416231
it is he who forsook us   202.7993566459728
chapter 45   186.07726245355434
brava   183.65641808419463
i gave one to the sultan who mounted it in his sabre   173.82676374141056
a ray of joy passed across m   99.57205292131066
said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt   185.47877365262647
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction   142.2896577248677
could your conversation have been overheard by anyone   137.66971875990006
the guards of the cardinal   37.49703985419296
she said   99.8920737504852
these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families   80.92689382349228
twice for my majordomo   147.24314501815297
30169m notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa   134.93259936673905
he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished   50.94969670449068
d artagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it   188.52742906146239
athos began to despair   144.18344921939408
a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises   59.258744070213076
you jest   64.63915021217764
now continued he addressing planchet you have eight days to get an interview with lord de winter   119.62398749142895
i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me   136.8680935775298
i too could dine where i like   120.65999927639855
ah yes indeed said monte cristo with a sigh   44.316155323043546
monsieur is as usual led by his favorite   38.75550576087353
the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husband s cries   195.81908767649375
cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy   110.12426332516435
see the prince is pluming himself said one of the thieves   85.3430907918316
danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m   63.11554864713757
in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred   55.51681409666738
monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer   119.08694860321192
terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry   156.05889066851077
alas anything you please   175.02043609594182
where do you keep the poison you generally use madame   43.035502603694766
the famous secretaire is in the dressing room   104.26827366016099
you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine   133.85160379494056
unknown you say is the man who rendered you this service unknown to you   102.778594297976
these narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between luigi and teresa   231.17545184919882
but that will not affect you   115.28883223773109
sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment   118.2780205187282
well that some one will open the doors   83.97401524804444
the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix our modern rubens   19.866822527995055
one moment gentlemen cried flamarens   167.26646981498652
the two men drew back   116.57859547038484

he started and the prisoner saw that start for though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her   129.63009617184986
he seemed to be quite overcome   188.0876850373994
it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form   77.94572859052812
and i thank you for planchet my dear athos   98.91387279012272
a flurry in stocks chapter 55   136.35985528666083
on the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly   202.774313693484
this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great effect   127.60732233420293
it is he who has raised all this revolt   129.31330042625282
and now i am convinced said d artagnan that this abduction of the queen s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris   98.52749873492039
the cortege proceeded to notre dame where a te deum was chanted   89.775533584941
but at the moment when buckingham crossed the threshold he turned round and seeing the hesitation of the young man come in   139.36115752718845
besides what was morcerf seeking   121.09536118394136
well this evening will come thank god   139.70309284180397
d artagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired   100.44898894887288
at the letter s the old man stopped her   70.04232818775066
beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night   104.98740535368236
the history is a sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head   58.88477060551488
maximilian said he return home   90.76494181549923
but said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of kitty i must not play the fool   127.21955186270644
and will you direct us   122.89458552664561
my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen   118.05495924409678
these words produced a contrary effect to that which mordaunt had anticipated   45.44092417969256
the knowledge that i have of the queen s heart   88.20615055415755
well then said aramis we must form a plan of battle   116.18941422097146
the whole establishment had been changed   162.5349382933283
do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year in this amusement   183.98810786568288
where shall we meet again   100.7458178993233
and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion   237.50775473972868
oh such a dreadful thing that i don t dare to tell you   228.95343959364834

was ordered to remain at martigues   151.27865024442318
i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness   136.5686208880863
oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that i have found that which i sought   167.60351763816982
in his eyes and to his conviction mme   138.1495778328667
yes i know there are traditions of that sort said comminges   112.53119845552159
d artagnan bowed to mme   47.734926303755884
it was you who believing that de wardes had deceived you wished to have him killed by his rival   117.03479781885537
see john see how well she knows how to handle a knife   140.8543747270738
think of it madame he said   36.397340754813555
directly afterwards the moon rose   76.6290321628513
two or three thousand   135.5895618418113
may the blessings of heaven fall upon monsieur   140.54449450945634
on the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the london stamp which only contained these lines i have them   154.13060287331473
cried scarron i should compromise you too much   35.44370550334311
he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and d avrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to say he is mad   113.96496804692043
de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home   78.06978604353472
but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry   171.8812466667272
and madame de saint méran have died   121.77705547138306
i know it said château renaud   103.34276472699804
then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too   84.7998066471309
by the excellent abbé busoni   148.92349893437515
mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room   126.04830786466836
and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts   121.94964823340173
were it liquid gold monsieur blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this wine   67.59007029922694
already dantès had visited this maritime bourse two or three times and seeing all these hardy free traders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds   59.08480962026793
she collected her features and in a complaining voice said in the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy i am to attribute the violence that is done me   138.72296518589576
valentine remained dumb and motionless   110.20452596895024
brucine is no longer employed but a simple narcotic   109.12855073115524
for instance that the queen would have a son   127.58017733412929
peppino was a handsome young man of four or five and twenty bronzed by the sun   132.78920278711885
about fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad perthshire dialect   122.35840833603201
do i know those people   111.52748919719508
in this valley were magnificent gardens planted by hassen ben sabah and in these gardens isolated pavilions   104.74553317614665
a man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the new comers contemplated him   106.51411721917839
ah your pardon said albert turning round   96.65359485187057
at this cry all the crowd re entered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult   174.10136155010537
i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscount s door   48.06251711422399
he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that mousqueton was thirsty   108.05353849532551
even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin   109.3805814555567
peppino was decidedly an epicure   133.13293126801108
now they will be far from looking for us among the puritans   173.95723493817485
now planchet has an excellent memory   171.65301379767908
who has paid me this attention   169.3675508700221
it was only poisoned to the abbé adelmonte   109.88265479537938
apropos my lord   110.94394209927565
on seeing d artagnan rise porthos rose also   54.45620300229304
at your service sir   79.17812502263806
no one enters here without an order from m   114.74118668152934
athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior   169.45513109673408
you tell me so i believe you   69.91463689785706
the vicar himself awaited him conducted him to the top of the tower and when there pointed to a little door placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return and went down again   78.42013605666813
then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said i wish you joy my lord   95.28770496603155
monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moment s reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me   15.161027014121302
it was this gentleman   44.8705483875942
i must speak to monsieur de tréville on an affair of importance   101.00312649387745
only the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and groslow and his three sailors were consumed   93.04563454823185
the symptoms are marked do you see   71.46244269334049
at one o clock this morning she had not returned   86.13180386469705
and some even came to a contrary decision   96.3160236949017
d artagnan you restore me to life   138.9250577203558
while his eminence was seeking for me in paris i would take without sound of drum or trumpet the road to picardy and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions   121.24848809924242
he disappeared by degrees   156.39527619244598
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy   88.1994416896214
for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings   43.43678053155648
yes and he said he would do his best to please your highness   154.61006116567157
that is my answer   110.68833758426733
our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight   146.7295990007766
and the king laughed facetiously   149.63940151452272
and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m   55.863844528930535
tell us then d artagnan   109.38082408961573
the cardinal s replied mme   124.6628970331851
behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers   115.90167632135709
d artagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass fall   208.42152751098308
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition   6.946889394691155
mark well what i say   158.21020151463046
and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing you may regard it as done for done it shall be on the word and faith of hush   83.43668209937938
still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain   131.082484048862
for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven   91.29787732446762
follow me said the man   89.80186431568103
in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust   138.90294920072515
let us set out again at full gallop   88.62423205782557
mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves pity pity on me gentlemen in heaven s name   124.73654684511769
danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic that is his word   98.21575437506306
that s agreed said porthos   140.7165924934222
we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos   30.307094641444024
i obtain the letter and i run directly to the cardinal   85.73881556218836
where on the balcony   61.013802867616484
these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so soundly   122.44388313082591
they seek for him in the mountains and he is on the waters   173.65475934307966
noirtier s joy continued   149.33996398465962
yes at present continued lord de winter you will remain in this castle   125.99022808300413
don t think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he   58.28324969327269
yes indicated the old man   127.14334242469825
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it   112.67855558194326
that negotiator will be me   102.42771840066347
a friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their aid   107.77310176531324
could i not   204.15738065612743
but how shall we be happy   59.21942509254616
i can not die without confiding her to someone   43.11343930288277
it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel   82.99180016072182
yes i see   99.67416560845531
rest yourself mother he said   113.17379744321329
and he comes from marseilles   141.98086574200028
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community   88.60642944987745
ah interrupted morcerf laughing beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the corsaire or the charivari but spare my future father in law before me   127.12079057778757
he again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound   83.4811512366944
inquired athos in a tremulous voice   153.61137609692537
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe   101.29234434042495
40112m when did you first feel that   164.80072141774977
this new tenant who as we have said was an italian was called il signor giacomo busoni   95.31500118452084
danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs   119.953195260033
he tried to follow monte cristo   180.5957272408441
and i deny it said tréville   166.64365513853542
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all   61.06985685607074
alas would i could weep like you   140.46299687733907
he has faith in his friends   121.85548154929356
your fingers are stained with ink   131.9238308497543
at the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew his   117.51022200401304
ah ha whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief   107.52817233895752
the interior of the musketeers chapter viii   161.4571809201982
therefore ask my own secrets and i will reveal them to you   149.8087256075008
well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story   141.28342422066194
meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage   154.0960631062436
only the people remained full of noise and excitement   108.88239195623791
to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarin s hands that famous diamond you remember all about it that i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which i don t know how she has regained possession   124.1222561907262
the major drew himself up to his full height   158.99132594877173
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of d artagnan   62.88476313579201
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men   69.38435420986335
at blois d artagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal   37.33199214475252
let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us   32.96679472379853
you will i trust excuse me monsieur for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you he said but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people   155.36416267984805
you want valentine do you not   145.27530888973192
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion   131.43269687446144
we have scarcely left him two hours ago he does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are   140.1889178191749
i sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts   172.74350281135256
now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against england will your honor give me all four of them   156.1279238437239
i only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question   86.32982560980547
and you have that letter of the cardinal   129.90163512535793
stop gentlemen said albert   189.72383017806771
come then come then   99.73752128638537
0025m as to taking command of the vessel replied morrel that was his duty as captain s mate   53.11790656577706
aramis here   129.82147858396638
my lord said the guard i have simply mentioned the prophecy i heard from a man named coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the duke of beaufort will escape before whitsuntide   100.85664789104842
the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon   167.69780211731666
guard carefully the secret of your birth   127.92517101732255
chapter 38   135.38882558420752
nor does it much disquiet me   144.1428382334199
and do you account me that title   160.79455516992013
it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds   133.74917834666996
why yes i think so in the street said athos   147.700390989744
it is not your father or madame de villefort who is ill   94.37289426099655
groslow s face brightened   126.12368477554324
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions   139.1550480869792
the cardinalists were three   86.83074008865965
you will soon be paid   42.6939781891446
my dear doctor there is no communication between m   50.797069285883595
they proceeded then on their course   59.04310729700304
this is one of those attempts that happen every day   142.51001005630536
truly madame i recollect m   75.8952589280259
ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore you   96.72326575023843
then in a lower and more gentle voice he added   100.99680545176459
we could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us   195.52351939099805
and he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he managed   115.43473112969018
and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief   19.5340416443603
but i know you to be a man of honor   117.97492970750811
you are completely mistaken sir said monte cristo coldly who felt the perfidious manœuvre of the young man and understood the bearing of his words   82.01215279008686
and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy   166.46879846165052
but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said raoul   160.99295851109292
the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating   80.09649706242328
d artagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his eyes   44.55037338630295
it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner   167.51526722584873
the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward   148.5791857356973
i have still twenty pistoles sir   93.34757230612568
a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain   19.493492221810655
could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me   115.35803559538367
what do you propose   91.75452810777696
the president looked at his auditors   139.039639171744
no no you are deceived she is a queen   189.64644459375
and he remained again motionless and thoughtful   106.4636927381466
inflexible man   124.45816850762685
they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider s pockets to make him weight   66.6129728417774
he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peter s by daylight   102.6645942610643
the garden was long and narrow   145.52439667022094
what do you mean by a struggle   15.003112903570582
de tréville in the same tone that a party of procureurs commissaries and men of the police very estimable people but very inveterate as it appears against the uniform have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house to lead away through the open street and throw into fort l evêque all upon an order which they have refused to show me one of my or rather your musketeers sire of irreproachable conduct of an almost illustrious reputation and whom your majesty knows favorably monsieur athos   36.622584670980785
there will be time for both   44.12790589758808
i have no motive for defending monsieur   90.89522767782967
and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour   61.477051570608616
athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte what is he to do with all those dignities the comte de la fere comte de bragelonne   132.82500111637793
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages   141.49595249584897
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything even his father   108.087277565916
yes that s the thing my lord   95.86210385538995
is it possible exclaimed the count with well feigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness   84.53854818041094
for perhaps they were too high placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were   139.7955868917353
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud   64.1542926264595
d artagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captain s alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them come along he said   169.2550002074138
after which they withdrew   132.54345005128036
because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands   93.12034948243941
she was talking with great animation with the stranger   115.06013016952572
bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six o clock   95.22655677800815
perhaps there is still time to save us   119.30647623875483
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth   117.05368766536246
villefort wiped the perspiration from his forehead   74.7654253863976
exclaimed d artagnan   90.56820507571926
go up when you are ready and sleep well   101.8160194698923
and at the first alarm we can leave france   157.41891819682348
you have befouled the face of your king   113.42830182545595
pardon me my god   133.0063681552239
gasped danglars so be it   137.5386670986721
otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times   112.06099552236994
go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint louis to owe his life to the man of arcola marengo austerlitz   80.69419534798341
it is magnificent continued beauchamp to be able to exercise so much self control   126.0844265006253
albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots   106.38243776751958
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity   100.77201386782517
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in   102.65391492448143
when he saw luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him   136.50912918948043
monte cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name   166.2303075630297
it is i said d artagnan in a subdued voice i the comte de wardes   129.12086433113558
i began to fear that he would not come   72.58907946923618
and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbé and not from the good abbé himself   152.06446859001855
what story can i invent   71.87098400282747
no one could be seen or heard   155.47956594400216
i like men of head and heart   177.77346725143352
who dares to answer for another man when the wisest when those most after god s own heart hesitate to answer for themselves and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate   113.4578082629445
this was what vampa longed for   164.31058967171015
oh mon dieu   79.2195165030608
but who knows what has become of them   132.03908432517943
and let us admit it the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to speak   125.08365011139267
certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others   56.70662537837082
he went toward the door and opened it hastily   126.90571896047405
there is half past ten striking albert   103.25408098232406
well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune   87.48188514871421
it concerns the best interests of your father said the messenger   118.70665939866406
do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator   142.95794564775358
such things continued bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession   123.29009970522816
my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady   115.4677744159314
she looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy   61.0644220347918
sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged   116.1769406392329
cried d artagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword   88.40562099378738
the wife of athos chapter xxviii   190.93578340115516
well said milady for you i will wait   108.90680796310293
she was very plainly dressed as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning   144.75676310412658
you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed   100.28113942893035
he will do wonders then   148.96802691680787
i desire to go to thirsk   92.37127833262817
the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hell that is the point   43.19476005814718
where she was known as la belle provençale   189.00720737134685
one never has too much   117.24132902723669
well we must wait   151.9292514493473
but grimaud s ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses   106.71564123326229
the storm still continued   59.39130211947304
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look   108.7555104079566
they knew d artagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose   130.71129766492513
it is their business to judge and they shall judge   143.333399982184
he was not long in making his toilet   98.01924106418006
allow me then to pass on since it is not with me you have anything to do   189.61581364519344
what king   96.76358433055876
i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory   175.608603972364
there had been no stipulation in her favor   91.56500105986665
be one or the other but not both replied porthos   126.30801809455666
to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening   85.24427990172131
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint méran   154.09062836450036
with the entrance of m   141.16710550360608
ah said caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold   51.430711284241795
only he was engaged with someone and begged danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing room   155.36362848090363
the cardinal has touched me with his hand   125.14655800234235
albert too was ill at ease   183.88864468025452
nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich   200.9343137538399
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin   136.08109970897064
but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions   76.40643289349593
villefort s only answer was a stifled groan   153.7966451932665
the middle one   150.04699457409708
he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefort s apartments and to hers   191.6964197418129
monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word   113.46820176579206
after finishing that calculation i had a minute s hope   121.06731313448172
oh i will be a match for you   81.50114234739391
yes was the laconic reply   143.33174914640142
what became of you   132.59013131224964
if i m not mistaken here s bazin   46.75639012184689
as luigi spoke thus he left her   155.17657784866017
i am young and strong   139.92640842340202
he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one i offer you   81.80170541069494
but the fleur de lis on her shoulder   76.67961207609011
the dinner chapter 64   183.80872175101055
bazin perceived he was wrong   128.94866103284258
porthos sighed for the fifth time d artagnan had counted his sighs   112.52863540753336
noirtier is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind   134.18191603581147
honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation   143.73694399518556
the next day kitty went to see the young man again and related to him all that had passed on the preceding evening   32.48199662440864
what relics are those by which you swear   148.3337327734422
it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini   111.17123782412276
she had in her first marriage i don t think d artagnan i am telling you anything new married a lawyer   97.65317158492633
dear child   104.66730820421769
he had still a nose but his cheeks fattened out each took a portion of it unto themselves   83.1329189825658
and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious bed   121.80354880727747
i shall faint again   95.4873281702346
here he is here he is   129.33105338711292
laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed   89.24121037800566
once in service i shall be rich once in m   118.2908519646327
nature has made us thus   95.42561838566695
in his youth d artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities   87.69259179432328
in fact he did not notice the offered hand   45.30188388944987
inquired valentine uneasily   110.70365052138767
said the light horseman   89.13794064842293
replied the young man   99.26643498363516
when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight that grimaud kept bad watch   145.99823745313688
cried anne of austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell   80.72386047962823
he was stout had a short thick neck   162.42017535888397
ah i knew her   164.56894443439904
but at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken   76.26752587850912
as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m   138.14475304582615
i always have one ready day and night   145.64701096915957
the queen s eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away   161.7724816489931
did he allude to his hope of being captain   98.68953141036609
up sire   92.02958187678706
but his majesty has judges and these judges will decide   136.8485623995079
but that is the history of the hundred days m   133.98661533034308
yet in spite of all this seduction milady might fail for felton was forewarned and that against the least chance   122.69707371521756
chapter lxvii   168.3299853022388
but without fail   102.37844860207926
and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal   176.8013631775031
my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies   89.85278452383513
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands   83.04340694361666
shall you be present in the reception room   55.807972461874755
the other day a banker s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate   77.16184352975105
do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles   130.27897836075655
the dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saint denis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station   128.20473596191349
he pushed through the crowd approached athos still insensible and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him greatly he required as the first and most urgent thing that the musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber   115.77515943896118
then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him as well as all who loved him and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court since she had discovered all   162.15207184900513
there still remained planchet s horse   78.71725833657626
yes her majesty the queen rochefort smiled contemptuously   136.54465054959002
have you seen the cardinal   96.71885782413857
morrel uttered a loud exclamation and frantic doubtful dazzled as though by a celestial vision he fell upon his knees   89.02966165080923
he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land   84.59165044826963
friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage   34.40462205406132
and when did you arrive here   88.23048692120298
my friend exclaimed monte cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness   103.90315059673475
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy   159.1059588416565
the lovely venetian is it not   100.04618037945562
caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart   133.01321741630477
i want capital to build my plans upon   94.21018957543242
if you loved me you would view all this otherwise   100.63487786926282
i shall no longer attempt my life   158.73223622142706
renée was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation   79.14602059988079
everything will be forgotten madame said villefort   80.99950290047545
on the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the court   82.18138022154059
and you what will you become   114.409228853406
each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a gentleman   23.392360285465998
a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard   83.6388773074224
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe   30.879868595061126
do you see   69.14491892703987
remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs   44.921865597529205
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself   75.66015241833085
no monsieur be satisfied   131.8582230285349
and in five minutes they stopped before the count s door   122.11678591435225
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined   19.687826513538255
and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people   69.45062944146191
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow   86.22908220528892
she had only one day left   111.96783570634848
cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit   214.7280602601602
when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food had recommenced   127.88677751705447
exclaimed the queen and i will prove to them i have not left   133.62015344693987
the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them   65.47571602898303
i promise it   158.07718487451348
truly she might have thought of you at home   141.9263215022374
sire resumed tréville as i told you monsieur d artagnan is little more than a boy   126.9788785699061
and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of rochefort   61.181213448535246
is it possible said monte cristo to himself that i can have met with a man that has no ambition   122.78317786714113
how much did it cost you   138.87453193985235
my faith my dear aramis said d artagnan who detested verses almost as much as he did latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits   140.23952880313152
these devils of english how suspicious they are   191.99491970505207
and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation   82.91671144720785
and now said morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away   99.78477173996302
don t ask me for counsel   66.81125542928896
still said barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if m   78.24075026747255
draw out one of the feet that support the bed   37.0977478347903
you are mistaken porthos said d artagnan   55.706058138444355
athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned   169.21072688595896
if you prefer any other place said athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves   113.6340315892926
i had him put into a leaden coffin and i am preceding him by a few days   109.84296503011709
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old man s happiness was centred in his granddaughter   87.70824545094436
then you must come up into my room   209.89062099806856
certainly my lord   135.10958789315703
and i also said aramis   136.12125943084226
ah i know the way you get good sweetened rum over there   113.64904505520093
i was really happy   105.25842218350508
athos you are not in your right senses i swear   19.0362447532505
and so at last old dantès was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide   182.32244087279906
and how so if you please   106.87661523138324
indeed my dear d artagnan i don t know how you manage but you are always full of ideas   112.58176178763493
calm yourself   178.22903834072062
bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery   94.46098825282249
my throat is closing up   127.51551041486154
and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time   58.01972754679772
there s one just arrived and she handed the letter to d artagnan   39.3365949699719
they did you not see what they did   65.51362127749712
i now remember having had the honor of meeting you   116.25494502001283
there was a moment s silence during which the noise of the banker s pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling   111.35156972782437
robert macaire is the hero of two favorite melodramas chien de montargis and chien d aubry and the name is applied to bold criminals as a term of derision   119.84573646492998
he saw d artagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance   103.7423930820988
that is it precisely signor aladdin   166.9935491895107
oh i entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it   189.54433986100418
you said let us die here   117.3250675649968
he reiterated   144.17903217929228
diffident in allowing the sarcastic aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings   77.07277639167481
but alas i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security   44.49253241502305
as a skillful general seeing the enemy ready to surrender marches toward him with a cry of victory she rose beautiful as an antique priestess inspired like a christian virgin her arms extended her throat uncovered her hair disheveled holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young puritan and went toward him crying out with a vehement air and in her melodious voice to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy let this victim to baal be sent to the lions the martyr be thrown   137.65896455485756
well everything was finished as you know   118.08877776577206
on him on him always on him   126.97853939530364

a prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me   79.55959925819928
i depend upon you to escort me home   70.91729346207723
the minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out by the telegraph sire   150.25038316148493
good day monsieur dulaurier replied d artagnan   119.95212838212349
upon my word said dantès you make me shudder   86.85528403621578
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups   62.885338983845905
he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town   148.9860905911307
they are all the same price   178.5391619447331
and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied the other belonging to aramis himself   120.07643597081116
what then would be the use of all i have suffered   97.80497056452347
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following   69.4769534664587

enter sir said he   182.64238898458484
d artagnan going to a distance to discover aramis   120.45322952027443
whom do you call that wretch   94.79727261984374
i am here   138.81052039122483
a fearful day when to day we find our friends   123.79932526630002
we will pay our compliments to that poor man   125.24967758918827
we will hasten on to the inn   134.21443171624873
i have replied morrel   146.39583877046272
no reverend sir   95.52287137108422
he was put in a dungeon   256.0077878819242
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do   37.346541302666196
i beg you to excuse me madame   119.79944827402352
carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions   90.53817952277254
and let us speak it to the praise of m   96.41114038625763

aramis pointed toward heaven   195.10143616059668
and this very day we will write the letters said aramis   159.5850185718223
those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry long live broussel   161.81518624007086
oh death death   55.91038959613222
haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her head   70.88436001097767
only their wish to see each other had become a necessity and they would have preferred death to a day s separation   145.54850296606799
athos became thoughtful   169.4001513380754
well said d artagnan smiling at the misanthropy of athos which from any other person would have offended him i ride what i can get   124.77235687858673
in 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal i received a letter from athos   130.9104976999965
and do you comprehend grimaud   165.00621687964667
who is this officer inquired raoul of athos who is speaking   94.0882849084869
her brother   68.38967617119678
and you what will you do   94.3529458136401
i prefer going sir   125.81912928734154
he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog   122.01834178123143
you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything   131.36692270383608
oh you render me the happiest of men   56.12220666315991
poor brute accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia   121.53696206274977
he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped   122.04957995090903
she listened at eugénie s door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place   32.80286260841332
another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements   117.98776709360288
i know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said baptistin   142.45507281911551
you will find it in the water you drink from the spring in the fruit you pluck from the tree   118.75140281235738
you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely   200.5278783736063
the king sighed deeply   111.03941995516087
a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living   51.93006648208654
but athos   164.73899923634292
it was at the traitor s cross that lesser criminals were executed   207.38854551134847
yesterday her fever amounted to delirium   169.23578732307044
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist   175.853317197963
and how long had you to take care of him   165.24355044247903
but what was their surprise after passing saint denis to hear that at saint germain people were singing and laughing and leading generally cheerful lives   157.74127953711476
the coadjutor   32.934113296752315
personally i do not know you   88.98649649521536
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand   32.50605528668875
you do not understand   98.16228613728856
the fact is we do not lodge travellers indeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping here   85.21804816698105
say when shall it be   113.94714108246124
you might have taken lord winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him   141.2085070208765
and in what part of auteuil do you reside   121.14664345820111
believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are there   133.92900544734508
you have an account open with messrs   114.39433590313915
he could not speak   100.44355996599408
his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with joy   136.0484760647042
such is really the case i assure you upon my honor   156.21105670500307
i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday   151.4466066809136
it was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of henry iv   164.1240725532228
was i not your second   106.61385291638807
then give me water cried danglars endeavoring to parry the blow   197.90331031643962
you have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door   162.4906135807294
monsieur athos do me then the honor to accompany me   119.42160866255327
you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me   118.62836863032588
cried d artagnan they ll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as we re in pursuit   56.72335863701125

to the health of the king monsieur   88.95431548301393
like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse   83.16315662247517
tis well danglars tis well   77.1185298938101
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme   151.50237556959922
this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen s coachmen on a cold night and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door   219.00339313407733
my brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of musketeers   140.02122219881784
they began to comprehend   59.17411844519926
the register of my child s birth   117.97030570495488
the safety of the horseman you know depends almost always upon the goodness of his horse   164.08249379859836
thou liest subtile one said d artagnan to himself   188.1054840857852
merely his daughter   158.0130940742444
undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winter s neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign s confidence and friendship   72.2127231283582
what must then be done   160.5820442929132
his name was carlini   94.15068785864305
what do you say sire   89.60460028874975
de morcerf will accompany me   88.7798195592047
planchet said d artagnan i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care   168.37531656136431
the love i have for you is very different from the love i had for my father   164.47474024807977
since i was a faithful servant my lord to cardinal richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death i should serve you well in defiance of the whole world   176.07692072894753
villefort rose and ran towards his mother in law for it was she   140.46211527557682
this probability afforded him his first consolation   59.16349494628215
but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time   98.92434748179133
your wife in going to rue de vaugirard and rue de la harpe did not go to find linen drapers   111.7959843342495
are you quite decided albert   134.65236126520804
40092m no thank you i am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now   119.70499261758039
bourges is the capital of charles vii   49.8963688802971
more than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service   180.61316914409983
my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment   113.01917067816512
because you do not love me madame   79.43931415966753
as soon as the earnest money was paid d artagnan took possession of his lodging and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost new doublet of the elder m   128.35867865990127
porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow   57.641364789866216
be as quick as possible i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour   50.77340514323086
and he held the bonds towards danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp   150.5695442123455
i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment   73.1202167659468
on intrigues from intriguers   42.47661643086495
cried anne with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her i believe that you are yourself interrogating   110.23347719817964
here s one your honor how the devil hast thou two horses   170.6751254851149
well here we are at last said one of them   106.88761542149622
while the third an old sailor at once the pilot and captain looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday and which may overtake them tomorrow   15.594489425111874
it was for him that you obtained pardon   163.83492722284834
is this all   134.18600499578884
and you count have made this match   136.7008382844483
this doctor has a niece continued aramis   123.84194871250054
all the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moment s notice   143.44758297464438
the count who perceived that m   79.80069384189213
barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted   75.7137553177923
he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection   55.07430835812105
it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so   54.766995396979596
athos has made me see that s all   76.60117949775227
the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies   77.36728158926144
they would have carried him to greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold   133.64904580349787
sleep well   32.30611872386268
the harlequin had reassumed her peasant s costume and as she passed she raised her mask   100.07738797962017
my very self dear friend   18.156947277890453
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step   104.5413665477018
my fingers were caught between two stones that of the wall and that of my ring and the skin was broken   156.82270588226024
you don t know him   74.43020859814933
the time for wine came   120.25031707193783
de saint méran with you   67.1639592087875
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair   89.06544290981802
every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent pistache   161.64535284543254
it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds   136.743586941402
danglars has left suspiciously   188.55326891219153
him i can place at your disposal   158.12620684997373
his name tell it me   161.99933028432272
otherwise you see although i am sure that general oliver cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad appearance   85.41078550264723
what do you intend to do   89.52079192780235
then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard   169.41022218747617
well what of that   140.86240250254795
you have received a regular letter of advice   118.6372552185911
coquenard who knew that a simple minded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great deal   130.60802523374306
yes but it was fated that i should not keep it   107.73081112467291
what the devil can you do with all that   122.67446303063
he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen   139.43553710527652
for you and your comrades   76.21498606491281
this plan succeeded   130.3803573088016
half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly   154.78157573676924
besides liberty of conscience is established in france   105.87771300551763
let us return to your apartment   117.76283500838399
well returned mazarin we will satisfy you   195.8683624322955
and though i do not much rely upon his promise i wish to be punctual   115.9792198938905
we are going to fetch our brevets said d artagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them   182.30156217087932
at this moment laporte reappeared   182.44406566749342
exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds   62.78967577981512
the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses french and rochellais   201.38963403489652
what are your commands   149.02878855044045
thus the future father and son in law stepped into the same carriage and morrel seeing them pass became uneasy   118.92792521830188
the executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid   129.02302371018823
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also   73.50428146031159
well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you   181.62067973589342
those guides are nothing but spies and might possibly recognize you   43.95293609736501
yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to planchet who was not in livery   162.09635056370172
because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it   118.1916067286068
danglars appeared delighted with you was he not   88.76556669506499
try and find a seat there is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper   141.12395793838874
not too much so replied d artagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient   101.9989705488331
franz gave him albert s letter   127.83128159894954
oh the great man   109.95716445880146
still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here   95.98421680143524
it had been d artagnan s practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles   162.47318370818684
but i require a strong mind to smile on my last moments   125.77837759104607
i have lighted it   87.33145844121823
his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abbé who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small two storied house behind saint sulpice   47.51679397530279
as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of henry iv   35.67259207921941
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse rear   30.095880052053673
he asked what was going on   97.75790375358247
and regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on   111.94432316238955
the damp had rendered it friable and dantès was able to break it off in small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful   119.48643108673949
know it   70.62381527316936
porthos looked very melancholy   172.24827430682282
he was taken at compiègne and all is over   101.02294479738053
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary   36.0531401748072
nautilus   105.31525998385074
but d artagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty s apartment   146.71642244305312
it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him   82.86796594676886
we must let the king know immediately   49.14168113609226
we mean the flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him   76.2220962296468
but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling   24.01785216440561
phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them   8.882182764544709
betrayed   89.28081827419129
they tacked and kept offshore   44.32090679383816
on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me   37.24798348180235
sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other men i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings   108.62078256315215
and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair   141.40947183149052
and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited d artagnan s reply   88.61208775940987
we are going according to all probability to la rochelle and once gone she will follow you to the end of the world athos if she recognizes you   116.9450855201859
however at length he decided leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies and ran to his mother his forehead streaming with perspiration   137.70309037780584
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it   62.57404650814139
i know all that i wish to know   142.4205282320001
cried the same voice impatiently whilst d artagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads   164.27790950461403
ali returned a sign in the negative   82.1290694912657
why i have as much money as i want   214.26693769453271
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat   95.95693903920763
he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof   111.79878005724987
come let us hear you   128.90765509892424
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions   38.68129178426909
d artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure   38.77933822260445
but excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes   154.93497579214676
this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night   141.40146798590902
a few steps in advance of the gate of saint honore they met a third troop   155.5121386365636
are you coming morrel   149.20050587918354
but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody s professions of friendship   103.41336240925102
although i was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and i tried to struggle against sleepiness   58.51583942492922
how sometimes the unhappy mistake chance for providence   122.35931604373174
chapter 55   83.80571535488862
i do not know of any grottos replied jacopo   53.99086864090445
when you like raoul   90.85150973189232
it is sometimes essential to government to cause a man s disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes   50.83835199468287
so serious that i must take leave of you for a few days   84.0175156163294
then emmanuel   120.99416211424388
i am a friend   104.23153777518948
the arms of d artagnan fell powerless by his side   34.72514695679075
at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me   147.9724117717349
franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons   122.44150762575013
but said caderousse again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed you must pay for it you understand   133.2068386813186
and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self preservation   112.0559187507441
dream of vengeance that evening milady gave orders that when m   97.19294639463226
there goes one   170.80212954492924
you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said villefort   137.70621656251564
i have answered you a hundred times fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me again   114.50265610798972
passionately   148.40770344841636
madame said d artagnan i have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place   187.9500454468912
one day to rest there   109.60564973696604
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point   121.91875388350077
cried the prisoner laughing violently and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee the king s commissioner   177.5708523875593
you look at my room my four straw chairs my images three francs each   125.16793833560062
cried de gondy   87.05805521620455
but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of athos   60.9115634979567
and eugénie with her usual precision opened a printed paper and read m   107.86245774202304
he gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he waited   139.17285851854254
said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the hand barrow   145.81651823332874
your companion   78.26250536430081
certainly sir replied the viscount   102.30868307888983
rochefort   134.6707370622961
it was the evening before when i had fallen asleep   153.3333985823743
two other men descended after danglars forming the rearguard and pushing danglars whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors   113.07437067273314
no it can not be   90.14084624982725
this light announced the reappearance of her jailers   117.7759920228943
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage   105.91071509868875
this exclamation which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder   111.31046775383646
the count breathed with difficulty   159.23704951399063
panther skins from the cape spotted beautifully like those that appeared to dante   186.7450158356953
he had passed the night standing and without sleep   120.13822610056889
and how did he treat you   114.79572043721747
yes he had us conducted into the orangery by monsieur bernouin his valet de chambre and from there we followed him to visit the comte de la fere   104.43997551031669
let me see your plan   172.22596319652072
for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing   40.47971439861483
andrea looked steadily at monte cristo and disappeared in the second drawing room   18.37480425431754
your profession   82.80817256109893
dessessart made him a sign to approach   144.4616352314309
there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates   118.7483544590713
shall i wait for you   130.82351733162676
i am sure of it said athos   69.08526837968944
on the contrary we are all free agents   74.55476390716807
but after the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others   159.47276180723475
and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error   112.1634929601714
so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly 1 700 000 francs this month   127.20091966219306
but said the officer i thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to general cromwell   116.35753283358802
i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice   127.97964370148289
buckingham gave d artagnan a chamber adjoining his own   99.42851263428902
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it   140.96649466629557
the sweat started forth on dantès brow   103.07987269871387
are you satisfied   90.82713676285209
tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel   117.23746487005812
did none of you charge your purveyor godeau to send me some wine   194.70308131213534
upon my word that is true said porthos   86.85642377998296
the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber   162.18796873966053
formerly i was your junior by two or three years and if i am not mistaken i am turned forty years old   82.59292500108346
the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace   153.84005431754184
he hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed we hear from yanina   53.27452968836069
as to the rest m   53.604627479939325
an hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire   47.18590987493074
although i had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling hunger   145.33982870565578
i renew the affair   55.173917736274774
for though i hear your words i declare i do not understand them   127.51958091607594
we were once four valiant knights four hearts fondly united   122.49945548396654
always to wait till the end of the month   49.82962078545084
that is natural enough   162.21507384179228
valentine trembled and looked at him with amazement   87.41542420517196
for on my conscience they are a race of men i admire greatly   157.5853030930904
they are fed on thyme only your hares   119.5996410315701
you have come then at last   60.81347904628386
a man who holds a sword in his hand and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword and does not fight is a coward   199.83637942422408
my good charles i particularly recommend to your care planchet the laquais of monsieur d artagnan   65.88548968977568
i understand said porthos   73.22160160067665
but who perpetrated that joke let me ask   24.9949989071185
at ten o clock   68.94660804737788
well now tell your story penelon   129.99087736178595
the authority of the king was to be maintained   84.65999162026108
it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit   124.16252422871781
it is not like this then said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain   14.911065811364068
bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce d artagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to aramis on leaving athos   97.62560025671571
art thou dumb   149.7724137714822
saying which monte cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count   133.61946665550647
it was completely deserted   118.34875545825372
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal   183.8694020324363
he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one   141.6409310962025
stay said d artagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door   68.71756737493037
i think i learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued milady   112.76688715614266
a man of fifty can not long bear malice with a wife of twenty three   84.50261997468483
he is admirably adapted to revive one s spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters   124.03946243620584
he was dead   194.72858141592076
with the count of morcerf answered monte cristo   103.13061586861144
on the king s service   137.78942037207108
asked villefort becoming still more pale   27.79041980773316
was this prepared in your presence   101.34869610981396
two horses that monsieur de tréville lends me at my pleasure and with which i am now going to take a ride to st   140.41328567969208
yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel   98.18302158138798
thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra   22.822921524550026
just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk   9.770101064341915
but where is your wicker flask monsieur mousqueton   89.34148361881017
d artagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and listened   121.24969560393018
you would do as much mr   80.28840051089085
and you assisted and took part in this great battle bragelonne   108.99257415595919
i felt pain   144.522372702371
the pleasure of seeing you   163.94432958886802
in my last moments i need a friend   11.76079665695869
the police of marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by sea   154.03952241816995
oh for pity s sake   107.52113212495208
the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way   137.19277532899267
help help   134.1391339658876
cried d artagnan recognizing the handwriting   169.0349504354703
danglars meditated an escape   61.44951955437495
besides we are conversing in italian   163.08330342177172
you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing   32.62866561139681
my dear planchet said d artagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me   133.76987082027796
chapter 40   125.26821633579661
peppino placed himself beside ali and they set off at a rapid pace   70.29076751883548
you will tell me that i am a living being and not a code a man and not a volume   119.3143011648063
d artagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge   124.04166562703848
i will answer for him count   55.78976244715339
joannes in the palais royal arcade pierre no   103.59743034159358
at what hour shall we come   176.87148557544953
suddenly we heard loud cries   123.55259188321523
well well said rochefort here is a chance which may pair off with the other   76.96252252472516
and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice   100.46213152951259
i taught my arm to slay my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles   88.20814452696484
then she picked up friquet   75.9136846932997
you meddle with politics do you and still more with cardinalist politics   165.44118298278113
to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service   101.59745124669253
she said at length   180.14188686840654
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you   143.63988894575638
if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed him   111.71622546356738
the moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road   149.21535110700353
the mountaineers are bonapartists sire   131.56282068101285
at half past ten an hour after the event   116.08641193842092
who is your second witness   173.05855942165323
from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds   152.50636430993364
the usher returned and made a sign to d artagnan to follow him   153.58027918214688
for that reason i wished to keep you near me   134.55878702352987
then why did she go just god   55.9174120059856
we shall meet again in a happier time   144.88870425164703
she will soon get over these things   94.91158468533622
he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie   162.08077601800733
the spanish one you mean i suppose   84.8332232802739
said lucien   124.59657728866974
it was about one of those purchases that interest women a purchase by which much might have been gained   49.32597221868562
they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account   54.45869018506544
crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear   151.921775175788
monsieur said athos letting him go you are not polite   106.80388159447268
he buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one is about to leave it   155.1386774577054
this man was myself   170.46661588977327
oh mademoiselle mademoiselle   152.51205652122414
chapter 108   142.66365488334182
why should we not be   52.50893084922658
what would you have me do   152.1500552957911
wait said athos   100.62071764272126
the cavalcade trotted on more sharply   127.85506351189682
if a repast were on foot athos presided over it better than any other placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned for him or that he had made for himself   161.5714147571333
morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown   138.30631952208086
the coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the affirmative   110.37801847635002
i don t maintain the contrary said d artagnan   96.09395297890283
ah monsieur returned albert i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this   157.54167984722477
you have no enemy here there is no one but fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend   127.4366225969368
and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abbé resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table where did we leave off   107.37515919750962
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head   212.19719082442987
and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant   189.52808741086653
his relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many things that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes consulted   142.1804666264437
upon our lackey s horses pardieu   118.03828311737753
danglars recollects having seen him   91.0654532102279
if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation   127.84009077883925
do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then   159.1669149280269
i ve remarked that your puritans revel in that color   101.80089679783477
let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father   93.87292848000544
at least i am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and i repeat that i am really interested for the count   73.37440126961391
come come d artagnan said athos do not affect to be strong minded   12.943704717383042
he found buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own hand   108.93928395675674
he has broken his ribs said the commander in a low voice   138.4934156713528
eugénie closed her eyes   78.73273591360093
it appears she resumed that he sold it he sold it in order to save me another time to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger he sold it to monsieur des essarts on whose finger i remarked it   109.79030291500084
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head   160.88194217756302
in addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection   91.20811359391972
this was done instantly   239.80523779210455
in a week i shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief   163.2365586165013
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage   132.7820928299287
isn t that what you would have me shout   40.757383814456276
perhaps we may one day be united   185.67611107786115
i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here duke said franz and desired them to come and inform me of his return   87.29840695288364
d artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st   82.48755441591666
has anyone been speaking to you against me   187.49673493316067
this will has already constituted haydée heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in england austria and holland furniture in my different palaces and houses and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants may still amount to sixty millions   151.44387247136305
he took the arm of château renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins   153.57554699433317
athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know   136.18129008681896
and we shall understand each other i hope   110.3483440754553
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones   132.41110984820176
the prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert   167.24732305004312
not a step forward or you re dead men   38.05743100488968
and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here   103.08347035799125
on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories   140.99856517606068
friends are shadows   97.29944651813624
in an instant i shall be dressed   82.41817397329402
i dreaded to become mad and forgetful   160.93694275448058
replied the old man   99.63267467559979
upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from mme   73.2106234967683
well his love is half real half fanciful   138.15063993572062
exclaimed la carconte   107.64841938280314
ah if i were but twenty years old   121.7892621366099
d aiguillon marion de lorme and several other gay women   166.67353760044597
no mercédès said monte cristo no   145.21263817408328
but harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the king s room followed by his companion charles stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to london without stopping day or night   116.90383805031213
in the stable   76.88846109288332
de villefort said the king come in   166.69597445694046
and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château d if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery   144.02333802600478
they had one and all deserted the accursed house   121.02472032785165
i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans   160.8155152413255
you are astonished i see   33.609943766328186
i am sir said the king much agitated   111.922340196145
and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined   102.26001740131926
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm   171.63035487207364
tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given   74.53274971798041
may i depend on it   90.80528921018978
i can not hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes   112.96908624450218
haydée replied the count you know that you are now in france and are free   94.0956967712951
villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream   176.84929842102267
said the gentleman   67.52465072068871
sixty   119.45201931276493
the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing i know   191.00376687665474
why about fifteen or eighteen days ago   159.8484867371768
exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison   95.78416354787439
well monsieur de busigny i will bet you said athos that my three companions messieurs porthos aramis and d artagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion st   180.68700540214627
don t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess   171.96225305143687
and you stopped there   111.93531598474247
you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude   121.01312436989747
he threw himself on his knees   77.906960839288
madame danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney   27.880637402788025
haydée my slave thinks me a greek   60.389097979548225
the sight of this officer recalled villefort from the third heaven to earth   87.38981560366678
or rather by instinct   76.62140894414756
how unfortunate i am   231.96116556867662
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the pharaon   192.1315102648437
but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event that is to say till two o clock in the afternoon two vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral s ship   197.0916663813794
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture   55.524894723017745
yes that is true said she and i will confess to your majesty that my husband your husband has none   194.93264236428433
i have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for i am too young but as an elder brother   110.50694515423979
woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king   152.46428050328257
but now suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think him   111.94035983589261
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken   107.7234552729852
ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades   123.51848540809368
andrea was gone   83.74022495546662
do you know what that warning was   51.64675136874153
very well you can retire m   79.24915575788788
where was she built   102.02420951535535
you mean to say you have been freed from confinement   147.92001083712154
chapter 52   133.33038554678274
haydée replied monte cristo   61.14904633215617
13 oh yes   139.25120981540758
tell me what i must do this time   57.00201331146795
he was notwithstanding anxious to set out   130.93170752411953
we shall search for some madame and i think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some together   88.50873984595006
fight on all occasions   90.35488458926218
i admit that would reassure me greatly   63.18890733662497
accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him   93.87468733492102
on the receipt of the count of monte cristo   54.62415448479598
well my friend i bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish   103.76391424721773
suddenly he felt an arm thrown around his body and a well known voice behind him exclaimed father dear father   73.75180894430605
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a prie dieu all its furniture   93.95391420749264
the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy   57.815412473002816
the great man has called me his friend   139.0559985315408
as porthos and aramis were undressing him in the hope of finding his wound not mortal a large purse dropped from his clothes   101.25625554029912
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties d artagnan would become the preserver of his friends   119.67201593953078
you have given me gold   155.58538337535776
i heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart   178.96023690581126
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing   101.64179623452489
what do i see in it   167.13694368170746
there s no use in thinking any more about athos   73.77105663154975
wait here ten minutes said m   129.66446066037307
at seven o clock in the morning he arose and called planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night   139.28736084836248
suddenly a great light appeared on the strand   141.34485982096268
replied the commissary   93.34987250244271
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano   69.59079348824646
condé himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him   66.60160490118342
we were in the palace of yanina   168.36165247367458
it was indeed peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chick peas stewed with bacon   112.16422126385359
d artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer s pretty wife for three hours   224.96213750674076
art thou sure   141.98971276730725
cried aramis do you see count   126.97150698191749
the musketeers set off and d artagnan was left alone with raoul   153.9451192287147
are you a surgeon   116.63087160544868
this evening the margin of possible delay expires   190.86268322223538
said d artagnan affecting surprise   175.07480588745304
cried d artagnan is the poor fellow worse then   126.90953787741262
to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte   189.3715437870731
very well take blaisois with whom i know not what to do since i already have grimaud   168.44984604113446
said the abbé turning towards dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass   251.69205339156656
a fallen prince   88.93019454463911
i love her   142.72853240429652
everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity   140.97012800912256
every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deed annihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again   131.93810553266533
yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged   48.67115898117676
sell the crown diamonds   174.88476654855577
the pharaon has gone down then   49.003551797072035
the cardinal was lavish to his underlings   44.488103874569546
once in london we shall be hard to find without considering continued athos throwing a glance at aramis the chances that may come to us on the way   136.13862107903358
and who has said a word about killing him muddlehead   63.25135693196852
on reaching la storta the point from whence rome is first visible the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of saint peter s which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable   164.76203646366776
yes my child   100.16866372956392
athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends monsieur mordaunt a duel between us is impossible   104.25826669518321
here is the order he gave me and the cross i took from his hand   161.74247964732336
not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor   149.54753382186556
and d artagnan poured out a glass of wine   128.04647154547678
that s a different thing   173.5996851799019
or the mysterious benefactress said athos   79.70738729997115
and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work   128.27280354461053
to you as the king s attorney i denounce mademoiselle de villefort do your duty   97.38735110140593
but if there be any letter he will give it to me   130.64761554275347
a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows   236.7866122755437
maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed him   184.5837453749433
de blacas we can rely on the army   184.41622523497256
they shall not have the king   83.32937068983938
shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout   50.7047558494331
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself   49.99872407886495
whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel   118.15288720928913
said andrea do you want anything more   160.31296377310176
the count extended his hand towards the library   73.18716013211606
stop there madame for this can not last   87.13474920591113
he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come   63.55188090173866
of glorious memory who was the king of the gascons as his majesty philip iv   110.88278827333959
do you authorize mademoiselle valentine to intrust herself to my honor   117.96295304893962
that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten   68.11484179533531
she who mistaking you for the cardinal s guards has just fled away   97.6453582643822
but he repented of it   151.84825474910565
i do what i please m   94.364675682866
but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him   80.28570480032727
with the enmity of the government   50.80543965050886
you heard what the count just said and also my reply   152.07478083363884
bonacieux saw that he hesitated   96.09058873034004
have you come to sup with me   128.58675961414454
milady smiled and d artagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile   104.95391272320899
do you remember your father haydée   136.4862238383941
the table at which the puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention harrison sat with his back to the king   150.8015059474696
the count went to his secrétaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself   148.27341356675765
and the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards   137.6616756073432
no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father s actions   167.22830931600762
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition   181.9780200436419
and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart   166.4371816332008
nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident   126.19644407095787
did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china   91.4703450525586
our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year from which we derive an income of 40 000 francs   126.07836579410206
and albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at her   121.56693648363219
i am going home   99.75981782513773
and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you   90.19364816536573
oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis   96.40995776465378
bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket   131.73919343160165
it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them   142.22212998875253
you are then some secret implacable and mortal enemy   86.58563677707421
your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not   68.78743517911326
one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not silent   156.64789010561628
a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common every day sort of attachment such as ours   42.0592367364645
you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as this   118.4138162086134
that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that i was ready to offer you my excuses   51.36458479767238
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles   234.73821694811664
these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selim s fiery lance   164.8289914372121
you can not guess said he what there is in that small vase can you   91.1418606418122
yes it is an extraordinary story said beauchamp   93.68200303976126
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there   1.3835451031947485
somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it i think   75.04091136533827
if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share   46.94946354606343
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone work   130.7983845499385
madame henrietta of england daughter of henry iv   47.94819961926201
certainly neither i nor fernand said danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner   43.60583388238827
just assume the tone and manner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come   115.08691179380048
it is there you are to take up your quarters   160.0262952504603
sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers   119.30361106579673
the spit turned the stove roared the pretty madeleine wept   56.316922039318534
nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement   80.59211748649302
athos and aramis exchanged smiles   58.08529631148238
i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said haydée quietly   120.4552151273846
i am afraid he has turned out ill she added   154.43598830734
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house   20.06084207400221
or perhaps you guessed that he was here   160.44677430168954
you are a jewel of a man mr   140.1173047480726
bonacieux was at his door   131.4145718824948
should the ransom be refused the prisoner is irrevocably lost   92.07533072345207
milady s supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers aloud prayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband a most austere puritan   96.45928252191683
i care no more about him than an empty bottle   74.41262324006104
but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasure s sake   67.91820913807146
i have imparted it to no one but my god and that in my prayers   190.69817749700394
i shall go and die by his side   82.21713342750131
there only then remained porthos and bicarat   112.44037995251982
i will return tomorrow said bertuccio   84.3868475384206
besides said the abbé god is merciful to all as he has been to you   74.9650605660103
from lyons to avignon still by steamboat   14.110888954297792
asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglars hair to stand on end   182.97408539318002
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglars excuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family   142.53402860681143
it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off   133.2679570386578
i understand what you say   113.86230495336837
anne was caught she could not draw back she signed   150.31474075568505
the joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it   94.16846022488994
god has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies and has given me this reward   119.389205630855
and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous   180.1030010818785
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house   76.01636672942965
yes once   103.0106002634296
very little at least   74.78052184427119
and as to the four or five volunteers monsieur has but to make his intentions known and the men will not be wanting   40.142832533120654
do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party   176.44896434289276
pardieu that is exactly the worst of all   89.69768555027574
villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy dead   116.53880926556782
if you had taken what madame de villefort has poured into your glass valentine valentine you would have been doomed   147.19923670868008
haydée was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement   195.70819178828276
grimaud moved as if to leave the room   208.3517548626051
at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him   31.703388634050413
when i returned she was married   127.37380944374516
nothing i laugh at raoul   167.08767301333182
without doubt senor   111.59103155261026
athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven   57.18977719852311
one day when he was seven years old he came to the curate of palestrina and asked to be taught to read   79.36122854620842
do you know what we are eating here   122.96918793595539
i will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family   88.18875993874514
all i ask is permission to remain abed   29.997184379366374
excellently well said   101.32929685959299
he will play me some dog s trick or other and that immediately said tréville   82.65843489457465
that poor child said madame de villefort when valentine was gone she makes me very uneasy and i should not be astonished if she had some serious illness   34.40899330996673
who learns it from whom   75.43101929339667
andrea i think you have managed this affair rather skilfully   137.1270133832415
it appears so   103.93812104156365
a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal   63.99932376170987
the angel was a demon   146.92184072419244
all the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety   167.7279713621519
but after all as i have given you proofs my dear cousin i am not unskilled in such affairs and i will take charge of the commission   56.15407220297847
at a hundred paces from the gates of calais d artagnan s horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose   111.2254454401293
0277m pretty strong rum   60.844052816841874
i beg you to do so   104.93653423417487
we were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the place royale said the wounded man   81.48400945922464
in the morning at nine o clock in the day at one o clock and in the evening at eight   109.29279175827587
the countenance of old dantès brightened   139.19447403447035
i have known persons he continued for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of d artagnan who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu   102.74987382049855
he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another musketeer   132.58006299316756
sir i surrender said louvieres presenting his unloaded musket to the officer   119.28572803529147
d artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquacity   183.55436749411524
but then hereditary rank is abolished   141.1060131336067
franz continued it was as we said the fifth of february   126.57667200554198
i want to see it   60.09269943323916
i found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend   98.26764854174354
you suppose then that there are some   83.03173040908972
the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could comprehend   153.77489942824468
d artagnan whose erudition we are well acquainted with evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m   96.61427614598334
mercédès i must revenge myself for i suffered fourteen years fourteen years i wept i cursed   197.47685031701255
there s another brave and excellent young man   206.6789253672806
how much does he spend yearly   185.2064789175611
i can not in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me vicomte you know i give my daughter two millions   125.17104846330831
to morrow night we shall rescue you   112.58423778954177
well said she   73.27249980105813
which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins   126.43454949299458
but you know guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage   100.12211983778228
said the musketeer as pale as a sheet   165.0017920342657
will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend   64.4535659105859
how much do you require for my ransom   104.57330291914754
it was my nom de guerre when monsieur d artagnan two other gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at the siege of la rochelle under the deceased cardinal and monsieur de bassompierre   92.70661149236142
i felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to it   155.20401540762745
if the supreme being has directed the fatal blow said emmanuel it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment   93.0071585247287
the four or five remaining hours before nine o clock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visits designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker s in their gayest equipages dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative   103.03381298026787
is he accompanied   134.76522343186193
and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer   73.40128155017996
i kill my boy   31.72193929154517
the writing was in reality charming and the orthography irreproachable   158.93189895861315
said d avrigny with surprise   162.65557276730803
once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure   136.2860833696911
is that possible   73.37930983168803
my lord said la ramee if you will take a bit of good advice don t put that off till you are old   69.33603821220197
the countess de winter chapter xxii   146.60431067268394
their tears will deprive me of the courage to die   53.53149291313884
no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night   84.40804574778599
the coadjutor gave me sixty men   188.3182245547515
the only time i have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at windsor   121.26999014013316
as long as they were within the circle of the camp the four friends did not exchange one word   131.39082954258208
should we not do better in the grottos   143.3124153893391
you have assassinated a woman then   110.29721580212816
a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deep seated hatred of ideality these were the elements of private and public life displayed by m   59.5389184175768
milady sprang toward him   189.2848098674302
i do not say there is any truth in what i am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night   103.31244381183791
but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect them far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir   74.70491009863963
every one grows childish in prison but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become so   129.31054284356495
i take charge of everything   73.21268947412713
but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation i attest it myself   96.80934339722353
i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express   212.46928836946097
in order to see the queen said aramis we must first see the cardinal   117.62861701729751
yes for the mother s sake his poor mother   213.57552363418685
precisely said the count   181.14351345540837
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination   113.55967365152584
coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further   87.50946323678548
in that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them   124.49128730101332
what s the matter with this head   108.16172238330567
a poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which i have sought so long rests on me for a moment   85.29742005543187
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same   130.14683988993252
then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable   115.76975315321047
a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back   140.57523253107604
that is you know a diversion which the duc d orleans made quite the fashion   94.44098977383511
we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways   95.86488296834163
i ought rather to say what i know   111.15672846225768
they passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open country   100.94829907883752
well never mind answered caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while danglars had merely sipped his   112.40612948611371
wait said caderousse we shall see   76.97751084755868
i do not think so my lord said bernouin   191.26476750494894
baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance   91.47530216639736
well where the devil are you going now   157.210437698906
ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the court   13.08722678822403
you carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself   113.11614393790258
and why were you so affected at that story or rather fable which the count related   125.41766054563925
madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward   74.71160127483742
we are on the very eve of it   93.63076354655921
why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation   114.10357312202625
well gentlemen the reason people die so multitudinously i like the word at m   135.653668612101
you would love me then if you were not queen   113.52629182967686
i told you so said d artagnan checking him with his hand   222.5949345576957
look and judge for yourself   157.60696512491677
shall i go and fetch it doctor   53.03719527940471
oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with weakness   119.11899554134567
he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers   21.684304534914432
be calm exclaimed athos for heaven s sake   178.96013262391688
said monte cristo coldly   75.40450761542564
my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile   37.462718293188274
god grant you as much   74.18586384905257
asked aramis laughing   150.3537392726663
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their brother   177.32564778376184
those idiots   153.08074293641369
courage madame   153.81810870368494
villefort forced a laugh   76.61362914936124
you will not accept my gold   172.48433884716667
sir said de winter i thought i had already made you aware that i am weary of this persecution   72.427052102934
move on then   106.72425880189834
he was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres   86.59100059265377
is mazarin dead   128.07536912625108
i will allow no one to annoy you   150.10259927683165
cried buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely shouting   132.70253822871064
dantès shuddered   108.98302951517988
athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing school   77.79429164628267
four hundred and seventy five livres said d artagnan who reckoned like archimedes   156.84997807934354
there is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed   73.28517185700198
the three friends looked on panting and astonished   146.78345507157613
and i said debray   127.37270459504579
ah but what is the matter with your hand d artagnan   133.532409659329
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle   129.19438055171634
and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawing room and was still awaiting them there   42.162408008981316
absolutely nothing   117.70769395178117
and you did not fire on him   90.44029116456116
cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave   81.5273434146302
but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop   48.56465024450121
franz looked up they were opposite the rospoli palace   118.78534745350015
i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress   159.9829615344286
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd   91.84207544290035
that will serve us for a relay said athos   111.0024559875812
leave that to me i have my plan   166.15034132785726
but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted   159.063279809346
i must know what you mean to do   94.45436542450123
but he will never have the king   214.09786112776058
he began his day by breakfasting substantially a bad beginning when one wants to employ the head but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body   129.84003463938745
is it not so father   109.35340512834142
take compassion on us or like jupiter you will wither us up   103.55150809812167
murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost   89.9773142455904
the poor lad s strength was almost exhausted   127.0359828491982
and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither a distance of about fifty feet   90.74988843467573
if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you albert s freedom   145.18597543549342
advise me what i had better do   96.01766269161322
ah you do well to ask said eugénie laughing   151.68086450717607
these words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape albert   117.24098913768209
to no one on my honor   102.07657986818684
his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life survived   141.78678333424247
then turning to mercédès he inquired who is this gentleman   35.38564444322752
the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales   159.1181707082759
he resolved to end his anxiety   165.89539181935214
20177m the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men s minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld   81.59258121994455
they know that i am intimate with you that you are in fact   148.59245943487127
but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted   54.142395595868855
madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter   92.59135526576885
and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept   155.92785338352365
and with a firm step morrel went up to his study while maximilian followed him trembling as he went   128.95473105152308
well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter   92.01070110185044
grimaud said athos still on the breach another musket   154.45952501090522
milady showed her the cardinal s order   3.404344070962054
but he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened   210.4912077418062
it was he who saved the life of your step mother and her son   105.28491231757705
this strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the allées de meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the truth   167.91804515642474
cried the brigadier   95.74689779276758
she raised her head with an effort   131.08786947036657
the great pompey lost that of pharsalia   82.80928099961537
the sermon over the procurator s wife advanced toward the holy font   127.82105840305341
do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the minister s   66.51815949020745
if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more   89.89996374972549
i always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you   112.21097958412663
save your skin   161.87763566045896
well you can go out by that door whenever you please   106.7927426673014
where do you keep your wine   138.20443887066662
i require a surgeon not a priest   103.09354892552747
athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine   8.42968348479647
my dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me   65.61937643252799
cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him   108.21640283549827
ah those orientals   114.28034747628405
and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us   8.939243815226604
i do not want it said the old man   161.21424891603377
it was evening   146.52692381905186
i require honorable guaranties   161.04282699008007
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner   211.39576638109318
silence said monte cristo   97.1080083612193
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you   154.3129753990557
is it your decision athos   98.12057145886405
depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and earth   96.28703437699873
that s a capital arrangement   156.80992042150302
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood   80.20848541549941
you can sleep here   132.16846115578002
the cardinal in deep thought and in silence began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament and to attire himself in the military coat which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace owing to his former campaigns in italy   144.6679019756016
after a run of two leagues mousqueton s horse sank   103.97049029214665
and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination   121.22871982770255
yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering   167.19273646530803
but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night   99.54886405873498
the silence however could not last forever   127.27309255777813
that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise   120.41699003419777
to accompany the doctor to the door added morrel   113.80588801197821
so near as that   182.77288632905226
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night   147.7248638135431
meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas   46.84662994761389
his eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first story   138.004372231066
tis not for me a private individual to disunite a queen from her kingdom   57.03906914174822
if my musketeers are guilty sire the guilty shall be placed in your majesty s hands who will dispose of them at your good pleasure   104.05526638850631
one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall   68.15277114282158
d artagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death   90.76968232848822

we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring   136.05975410739686
danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you   161.92004168961188

a glorious prize   119.10416302672532
the king wishes to get a sleep   85.67304771958584

valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks   183.00499756119035

at first the king answered that he would not go   29.45004125252602
but although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his appearance   151.2798902861952
with that word great things are done   68.16532896830577
ah don t be angry i beg of you that would be useless   136.12868583345218

father your coolness makes me shudder   55.92132272518652
each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea   123.10779202710299

he had his musketeers therefore as louis xiii   103.46928360077399

it is true he had been playing the day before   162.04327675054827
i have measured them   132.89657710914167
they broke open the doors and searched the dwelling but in vain   128.78961550780141

projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate   121.61840527302293

and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve   102.07621815704108
a moment s silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember   161.00733952966578
the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it immediately   96.9536624927447

i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur d emery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity   101.3691712607239
only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of d artagnan and looking at him earnestly you have not spoken of this lady   144.19836403779166
come raoul he said let us follow this man   163.52915039671723

villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue   61.345812686458096
i spurred on and found myself in the enemy s ranks   99.7030507114587
the third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows then returned and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations and then dragged assunta feet foremost towards the brazier expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted   154.63020234565008

i will become a nun said milady   145.35594777570086
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain   112.06004623058254
but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos   74.31832465365042
bonacieux was acquainted with all the turnings and windings of this part of the louvre appropriated for the people of the household   190.4030921032817
and that you may not forget me take this   99.75134350601212
the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as bonacieux did not the less enjoy it for an instant   115.18663018402972
come come dearest valentine confess that what i say is true lest i be tempted to call you unjust   142.40607513059425
so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box   139.885489324986
he kept himself upright and dreamed without sleeping   106.81820975968485
d artagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey   182.74609071694647
i encircled the castle   78.35643095121827
that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid   156.31531316970182
let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble   123.15450696293699
but you my dear athos you who so generously distributed the englishman s pistoles which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do   119.83886556322801

the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole   184.58701339070774
debray s name is mixed up in this affair   164.3592861420767

and he has no children with all these titles   133.99564267953056

oh dear yes sir   91.7118435502466
the king was already sanguine but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to joy   35.21026549638512

after giving some directions to ali who stood in the lobby the count took albert s arm   107.76711350589902
my friend aramis paused   158.61945204481776
he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs   204.6646813535546
but andrea drew a cigar case from his pocket took a havana quietly lit it and began smoking   52.47128085778924
and i reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous   69.04889385188709
if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince   126.90846221787073
but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen s apartment   214.17036582399743
the next day the prisoner s room was full of pictures and mottoes   97.9742567562208
the cellar what cellar   72.89521477867632
but i soon found out that he was betraying me   194.97552077128893
milady wished to please the abbess   109.66770145690298
it was a temporary indisposition   11.99744734534002
then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain   97.81977945206428
i never saw one with such a hide in my life   126.83376707144127
did you ever remark that   112.00857689835057
well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good m   67.61161529032782
what has the count done   107.06980171623483
but porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurator s wife was obliged to give place to the king   47.12885906157072
here said he is a proof of my satisfaction   135.8418136695201
speak freely   234.47764419063716
absent kings are very soon forgotten   121.28988047005159
but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantès return on a mission of vengeance   225.431130911687
no i have not asked you that said aramis with his subtle manner   130.7071165002584
we will discuss that subject at length some future time said he   86.00299408202044
franz took the letter and read tuesday evening at seven o clock descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you   35.90004375248833
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms   133.56198199145973
but first said morrel allow me sir to tell you who i am how much i love mademoiselle valentine and what are my designs respecting her   113.2171606128887
how is it sir that you are acquainted with this man   80.10379960409733
alas i have them no longer   100.35294007793505
bring six of them   42.897067779266266
and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed   89.24256167490321
that the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could see   193.04456812144855
paris is a horrible place in summer   205.66396063711466
cucumetto had violated thy daughter said the bandit   138.74486745389527
the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an old friend of the family of la valliere went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage   67.95899035065239
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full speed   69.52481813792684
danglars fancied that they had reached the long desired point   126.77242960210016
it is said m   148.3365852951968
peppino obeyed   173.91911790243162
thank god you have come   73.7195933432822
granted   62.800241701784365
true said noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is   63.25958327845706
his head with piercing eyes a straight nose a chin cut like that of brutus had altogether an indefinable character of grandeur and grace   47.79163927831124
what you say is full of sense replied d artagnan   149.4451546244621
i countenance nothing that is marvellous m   44.362473338000896
de monte cristo arrived   85.81079230084526
i used not to do so but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them   126.51834921791085
replied grimaud   112.98644863812713
it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france   134.05136826860073
there is nothing truer than that said porthos   141.04800384813998
but in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to open   130.79373737573718
at the expiration of ten minutes felton came   146.67607363888388
if the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup will retain its color   210.9063345785769
probably you have some correspondent in greece   100.53777417528141
thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes   170.87260670216506
and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration   155.57971799069082
he gained just twelve hours by this engagement   135.89740449147115
an excellent one said valentine   117.00887639682264
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray   104.75331475413711
you dear mamma   186.22672151052444
that is his fault   8.113110639111483
true true   37.29872661247606
there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm   133.11961283353656
but please god it won t be much and you will see him in a few days all alive and hearty   162.54167672060515
the clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman appeared   94.34914187707159
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours   116.95479699059983
and if we do overtake him   145.6476554701442
a young man we can sketch his portrait at a dash   86.48288647950308
de tréville requested athos whatever might happen to be observant of his duty to the king but particularly to the queen begging him to convey his desires to his comrades   168.55529291457697
the other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of edmond dantès   83.85402064649412
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy   181.1286226889104
but your mother   81.21566281962771
then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her costume   90.60031085325299
in prison he had suffered his beard to grow   156.42091365665397
on my honor in one single throw   76.33482739715608
said the jeweller   98.38067255073916
then said the count i am emboldened to speak openly to you   99.00727656525487
and grandpapa   166.00297541413204
the glass is three quarters empty   137.68323372586906
it is written in the good book said monte cristo that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation   62.8890978831443
alas it is unhappily but too true   177.01173819291125
oh when i said i was alone said milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places   172.19621495839579
that idiot bazin had the folly to make himself verger as you know and therefore can not leave notre dame   112.05448523048176
in eight days the campaign would open and he would be compelled to leave paris   69.02567012787827
should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost   109.95614031198002
when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan   135.8228890999543
and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing   78.17576062694856
elssler was dancing in le diable boiteux   160.0737782402084
no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not   106.40300367242345
monte cristo motioned him to be silent   129.64161717774746
i used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and i have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples   193.91972728701688
de winter turned and followed the direction of aramis s finger   78.1887115059881
when i had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a word   146.0879781440497
i tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded   121.77250982751637
i shall be one someday   101.61651736226584
you must have had enough for today   141.93822963288514
both were free from the fear of pursuit   49.99654577416996
two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company   91.55656211522154
ah monsieur le chevalier said planchet bowing   150.41544118900524
the clouds which m   110.80059829731293
sir we don t keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors   92.26599613401756
it was wrong monsieur porthos   81.39040805566918
then you know him   99.58996076124315
that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body   80.71959912252665
it was a fan which madame de villefort had left in the carriage   188.73031103965914
they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens   85.42267339832031
i will answer for everything   119.95663076991791
there are only a dozen men at the most   146.5680807704568
is that true and do you speak seriously   187.47521220573321
d artagnan returned to less important affairs and the three musketeers repaired to the king s quarters where they had to prepare their lodging   160.8396263707669
then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of felton the only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen   118.1399331407022
what was the matter with you baron   147.2956774939735
cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience   101.75991697359201
and we are going to his house   112.94753386217539
at length m   133.03088513437802
the coast owing to the gascon s stratagem was clear   35.72655017365585
thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair   157.27992552343207
the count smiled   58.38804376301459
what will you do with him madame   126.95660148290226
there were two means of gaining his object to search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the trench   75.71177925456162
the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the king s service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers   54.40698716439366
am i mistaken then   91.95784103117
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story   115.72908999714063
well well monsieur de villequier mazarin interposed i shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty   147.53956411137776
and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe free   199.4550806100871
cried caderousse rising and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table and which he covered with his two hands   152.35296708911892
replied villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well informed   158.79718094331992
the promise volume four chapter 74   245.25217890991763
it is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious work   120.34636115670749
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty   137.90504770945742
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion   97.31810534641406
and i frequently make use of it with all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence   188.98650546597088
my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence   68.91461112654602
he also morrel like you considered himself the unhappiest of men   92.94380358674985
coquenard and bade him farewell   146.17519982286066
d artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul   131.1630874526035
our athos who was as virtuous as scipio   81.18454201749427
what the devil are you doing here count   9.312082071178168
i believed it later   152.69603125998088
my dear host and you signora said albert in italian excuse my apparent stupidity   128.44404281199908
the baroness approached leaning on madame de villefort s arm   122.22738026711646
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram   29.60920321782652
his lieutenant   161.1528419516261
and others went to the police office to inquire if he had taken out a passport   175.74063631221424
are you not mistaken   143.51303086785154
and by the rapid glance that the young man s eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness   117.73103609464039
d artagnan saw from the expression of the queen s face that she was about to issue some violent command   24.608717249462245
but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons   144.94965239897098
in the meantime please to sit down monsieur and i will fetch you some refreshment   152.65261621226125
to nobody in the world   65.24359907677989
and the self satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond   177.30557810630893
by no means madame   95.23715781957442
get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up   50.61958228965692
then we must fly   119.12928424471013
tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated   186.80591472553513
oh real enough from anxiety doubtless at any rate they postponed the matter for two months   162.73235502674572
why this man is a cask   84.1786764306261
it was you who had madame bonacieux carried off   52.915119263785044
soon the two gentlemen stopped also   149.8098915814923
what is your pleasure   112.72860473666587
is it more serious than going to m   65.84803513179833
oh doctor what a dreadful word is that   119.49618483107949
she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course   142.27105108193544
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together   141.71374475382868
if i stay in paris i can not go to rome   88.19787400669475
she has near her a certain laporte   73.76232958448554
oh yes and with all my heart   19.79465050649219
i pass my life upon my legs   112.29770422025423
ah if i knew   107.18736481249685
as for me i am sure of it said the duke   121.71663182384097
but you said i think that i had nothing else to do   72.62448060550018
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness   135.9038902498481
they separated and d artagnan rushed between them like a dart   24.488459392755132
i wish my lord would make me one promise   88.1156555376765
very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me   116.35504110127057
the governor can be present   179.78798935923086
he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them i can answer for it   147.2267653558727
then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes   94.45035229157818
you have sent for me sir said athos to m   131.3536334463088
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the hôtel de ville for this important evening   99.96838340618348
the old man s eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness   118.43037192278209
have they not heard that of their colonel   128.7841120665326
fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs   135.54859528268767
monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours   150.8859885466013
but why all these precautions   138.8202099353772
so far so good laughed athos   84.48867461703468
milady passed her two arms round felton s neck and let herself slip out of the window   37.23846116884886
i ask your excellencies pardon but this is quite a french demand   65.18475678288371
the president stopped the coach   124.31958464189991
everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend i shall not meddle in politics   212.07185401775155
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips   140.43992104856457
if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain   183.7671535899764
repudiated by her husband said athos   172.78256034528277
perhaps it will be too late said gondy still unmoved   134.48730826457518
cried bonacieux follow you at this hour   99.67211996746977
oh cried the duchess i can not make war alone but i can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favorite on the honor of a duchess i will avenge myself   134.23543412232402
my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m   71.81485679787835
nevertheless said athos in your absence well in my absence haven t i put in my place grimaud and the scotchman   134.75584837718193
but one gets out of prison said caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and one s name is edmond dantès one seeks revenge what matters that   100.4838225084483
in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved   161.29111832167644
cried porthos here   204.62499072325625
really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me   116.68497641612699
ah sir you have given me confidence   157.8553122176943
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m   125.82806480742363
very well said albert extending his hand   136.42729995853827
danglars i ask you only how your engagement stands   136.3191117005102
you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of it   118.4899459695579
the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me   150.79699681194063
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes   132.14084096124046
i was shouting down with mazarin   75.54548553928225
and what is become of this benedetto   143.69471679314725
this yacht had been built by order of an englishman who having heard that the genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fast sailing vessels was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill   55.929669791273014
and if you please by the corso   169.7783773348053
we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos   67.75544705820457
the servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere she would receive him   97.24613361976337
beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house   149.6158896607569
and i who have answered for him to the queen i who have promised my poor mistress ah my god my god   128.1574215746199
at this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door   91.43591774408118
six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain   160.7097298646977
cried milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth   88.15330021442323
what do you think of the count   88.6091733442713
the duke meant to say affection   112.1672993976211
i will not talk   94.26282788304215
villefort s brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled dantès with apprehension   171.23009247384803
but he bethought him of m   88.82262793429223
really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine   121.2601736176288
chapter 104   60.19257753716144
dantès was beside himself with joy   55.558879985899104
what you count   184.24556006206123
then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds   159.1257181968516
he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things   18.873031245349765
threats   3.3720612852304583
de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables   92.47235260843497
the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them   102.84059437509279
the beginning or the end   81.9902345998234
the count s cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth   112.82932868533045
you will get me out if they put me there said d artagnan   43.89831397579117
the beauty alone remained   143.9176829620227
monsieur d artagnan is my tenant although he does not pay me my rent and even better on that account ought i to know him   102.6163536764588
he awaits the answer   155.49203118413595
i take them then said the lieutenant   129.39198749619263
mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him   95.94280886172112
messieurs athos porthos and aramis   118.00788815434689
at the first announcement of peace madame de chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities   48.73942861411852
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn   154.76163804543472
there are men somewhere about but that s of no consequence to us said d artagnan   115.58762585260077
that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours   46.92793110816915
he asked again   77.9778788818075
but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road   119.08671845440865
d avrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done   112.5440453640069
paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a desert   145.51958255887854
a coffer of which he had so often heard and which the hands a little wrinkled it is true but still not without elegance of the procurator s wife were about to open to his admiring looks   120.40830853243229
de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which d artagnan had left him a little cavalier   33.93360074056801
have you my dear aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play   157.5415049218866
here is de winter coming said athos   140.79685789564377
you are questioning me like a king s attorney   175.7941705602238
since he could not be a bayard he would become a raphael or a michael angelo   119.88529679029574
at ten minutes past five albert entered overjoyed   143.78234216845547
said mercédès blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever   100.5948828989035
the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old man s bed   165.32998895785687
well that s all very sensible athos said d artagnan   166.86754694044373
exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration   89.39872482808059
what a cold wind   101.2126319050676
here is a letter which must be taken to its address   138.65236604272258
he went to desire you to come to the palace   69.43315182307236
that happened which m   108.73715948757093
we don t want either rope ladders or gag pears now   97.9707161760914
cried felton in a high state of excitement   164.87733632566326
so he only said that she had gone out with her step mother and that she should be fetched   136.4797492841922
has such and such a perfume done anything for me   69.80491645003153
villefort is no longer at marseilles   128.46451463377815
work slowly said the curate   97.48412814579945
i take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully bertuccio   152.40104135081782
alas sire it is but too true   108.52118431400763
and in case of surviving he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct what a madcap i was and what a stupid fellow i am   170.72248068680207
that s not needed   110.35335927722355
noirtier continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression   63.304938150333896
and it was a fierce one   62.864196202116894
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty   84.18167040945299
poor fellow what is it   143.67455040840912
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that   121.43734486244733
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began   150.2138095394475
consider in short your people who love you and who yet are famished who have no other wish than to bless you and who nevertheless no i am wrong your subjects madame will never curse you   141.01194110852288
would you like to have a physician called   138.15663685370006
morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with perspiration   163.12346911733033
four strokes of the oar brought them to land   145.72667804871065
said athos turning on d artagnan a searching look   140.01217409429123
now that i am a captain in the royal musketeers i must make an appearance   167.4986422003149
50243m mon dieu   125.45301894573389
but to you at least m   126.14190934017958
they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting   12.66043174052956
the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and d artagnan went out followed by bernouin   135.4242544108153
he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed   72.19757713171562
he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london   120.26936532428343
my son said the abbé you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as i do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes   149.43368998469052
so now i have told my secret   106.18088026843915
when i am your wife   145.92327428898068
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all   86.09052422208987
a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth   171.37466607290767
which are your windows   46.732222783888005
the young man s eyes were red and he seemed dejected   169.49599364189106
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced   82.36926681883064
we had better wait and see what they want   107.65365199738889
then it seems i am to eat alone remarked the jeweller   170.03801641260938
if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor   29.16191594188544
when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now   88.18136933019338
queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy mission   116.25271188816505
valentine found her grandmother in bed   136.2320023023177
i say our country because you were born not far from marseilles   89.07573375695942
this second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the ground where he was writhing in agony   167.21913833480718
what can i say more   36.20621559075141
at last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot   94.06542638005206
young man said he to d artagnan a suggestion   103.43873476889219
d avrigny struck his forehead with his hand   69.3229234494845
this one was dead   91.7387965543468
but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course   38.98928366088951
where can i sleep   88.41493697187784
de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth   213.8597870209751
mercédès was much changed within the last few days   56.74376911696581
it is something to be well received   140.20945941120803
the young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted   107.28186242138145
never mind that   93.06866884209018
you will come to me or you will let me come to you   76.9781728945209
or rather au revoir   80.78921392647536
what means this   228.96234087882738
if they recognize you you are lost   73.12544179408698
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes   90.84163366967402
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared   109.02072719066783
gondy smiled the queen s color rose and mazarin grew even paler   54.533317058122314
did you ever see mercédès again   132.82711495524364
then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to part   149.61240883317524
you must dress yourself raoul said athos i am going to present you to some one   178.92446255050663
d artagnan trembled   231.93628915508407
but she has become queen of paris ad interim and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the palais royal or the tuileries she is installed at the hotel de ville where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke   144.21740384040498
the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700 000 francs in the course of an hour   103.70819931568154
but two or three scratches made by the gascon s blade terrified them   139.42939676593704
however my mother had still some hope   109.59721033711062
may i hope sir said madame de villefort that your intentions accord with my request   92.81816002659126
i am not your uncle i know you not   97.38512032685675
what monk   106.23410003030446
by the way m   68.53022127901956
augustine which he was forced to write in latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good deal   145.33943214833704
my dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent   127.81270967107794
do i not ali   113.36259949871375
you are of so superior a mind nothing escapes you   94.49015947135152
milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition   114.01624413701825
the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at porto ferrajo   95.13974164327267
for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy   236.73617446089975
ma foi i can hardly tell but i was alluding to those who wrote the letter   155.97246549124065
these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand francs were payable half on the 15th of this month and the other half on the 15th of next month   180.44489712325935
sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes   180.00979307053268
then i must wait here or in the neighborhood   105.32376920797302
the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of anguish   166.33871159828715
her first trial was lost   138.6840922337396
i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court   91.8556928534403
de tréville had intimated to them his majesty s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of may and they must immediately prepare their outfits   113.75612689804896
i did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they dreaded   108.47709529164555
but i also kept my word with him and i neither ate nor drank   91.05422199407779
lord wilmore resided in rue fontaine saint georges   92.27871457543428
in the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow   146.310374082179
athos counseled d artagnan to dismiss the fellow   162.5966779107818
the general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club   116.76213295588673
someone has told you the secret   104.72655293273242
these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will i trust do me the honor to breakfast with me   73.49136449500716
battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal   97.79712925469029
20172m the recommendation was needless   149.73693942335697
and he who says in projection means already decided said debray   80.38774913820741
but the prince de marsillac   78.17336019387446
and milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost wild   98.76390502428997
neither was it as with our neighbors the english an atmospheric influence which darkened his countenance   129.98708646360063
i require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne   173.84148346617945
maximilian morrel captain of spahis my friend   207.38112845641132
he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at d artagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance   67.14954845340333
the idea that he left behind him exposed to a frightful vengeance the woman he loved or rather whom he adored as a saint the emotion he had experienced present fatigue all together exalted his mind above human feeling   120.35324608773091
god of goodness   159.9961764073149
sir i am very hungry replied mouston   110.23773471791735
it is he who knowing it was i who had madame bonacieux carried off has sworn my death   67.58664886759178
what else can a strapping chap of twenty one mean with a fine wench of seventeen   70.83579085640949
he was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave vincennes   94.49491804396602
i retreated with the rest for eight and forty hours   187.5143094526448
it became as dull and vacant as before   116.06054039314864
when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at rome   137.7662990655678
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you   85.07930662398269
but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day   180.7134255348401
you love valentine that daughter of an accursed race   57.21161192839289
on what occasion   140.45673127253406
cried d artagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason   192.59818430263488
said anne of austria   81.52329261331434
both are easily excited but they quiet down immediately   215.3181110836834
and on one of those lovely shoulders round and white d artagnan recognized with inexpressible astonishment the fleur de lis that indelible mark which the hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted   131.102271131895
besides the appearance of the caravan was formidable   66.75346748968911
but this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps death   103.24035659026093
take it quickly   149.3275149588654
has your uneasiness anything to do with what m   74.5369637319452
you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage   60.39270111389894
silence silence begone   137.39118625428523
i guessed it   125.74202761091031
i don t find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy   138.53448997966322
if your majesty is so said tréville we are   107.99265515508043
then aloud may i not offer my duty to her majesty the queen   136.21360766472836
the unhappy young man had not thought of this   36.31032597650852
noirtier de villefort chapter 59   103.34427367451092
well then said felton i will tell you what you were doing or rather what you meant to do   142.14232143771682
nevertheless at eight o clock in the morning the regiment of the queen s guards commanded by guitant under whom was his nephew comminges marched publicly preceded by drums and trumpets filing off from the palais royal as far as notre dame a manoeuvre which the parisians witnessed tranquilly delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms   164.97976509617075
and have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result   138.42198811956737
could the prisoners see each other   92.92045027024363
and i not at all said mousqueton   196.20820067800884
nogent beautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment   122.22637204655713
the champs élysées   88.55408933894475
she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her   136.24048799349848
to what are you not equal with your superior intelligence infallible eye your arm of iron and your enterprising mind   110.16611856572287
but allow me to say that you must have been very young then   108.18567126737288
because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the rue coq héron   155.01163539738036
fortunately morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely   70.28026355286383
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentine s future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them   76.69617455568729
i declare to my nephew guido spada my sole heir that i have bu   57.80087223189752
but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness   123.0925834613865
beauchamp if you assure me that m   202.7592870620557
d artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with lord de winter and then returned to milady   106.76879281093014
cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window   72.70027481111012
their signature is worth five per cent   122.11227359233499
monsieur the coadjutor s carriage   121.1946450577515
the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly to give you pleasure my sweet renée i promise to show all the lenity in my power   127.4244065459946
the next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy light   120.74708555877896
20235m the devil take me if i remember returned château renaud   79.68238908664854
with the servants you understand   154.46162726518926
i once loved her much and to do her justice she was very useful to us   50.68523017555948
planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase   10.026932714611618
reload the muskets grimaud said athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our conversation   62.509283094731565
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door madame he said i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay   151.00601277599745
attempt to murder me in my father s house in my room on my bed of sickness   153.26377010492763
he was like a man in a dream   181.50342845063238
and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum   154.7649670740998
very well said the cardinal   166.16658419632782
have what you will   77.83426567453222
it had a bitter taste   210.35784514928434
monsieur de comminges he said pardon me   109.80990683051127
an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques   90.98476093843811
what scotch   82.53967474520871
he then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs   120.97596240833164
i am told it is a delightful place   51.24708547425081
our servants   86.61507268559308
only i have seen things which induce me to believe as i told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries   61.05235151140402
benedetto never again appeared at rogliano neither have i since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him   107.19381212199058
death is depicted on his face   66.72704405756821
who could have told you so   137.6894993031279
le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed   81.4613461468294
it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love   74.47282787742022
stop my horse has the staggers   111.9913460102049
d artagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud   129.33408726276437
who told you that i loved him   173.14704543641528
the two guards marched abreast with him and the two soldiers followed behind   86.52604956763257
when you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern without a name and without a sign a mere fisherman s hut   169.3866036405704
two lackeys dragged milady whom each held by one arm   194.947526751044
asked andrea   196.87743664732955
whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness   57.576539531405466
shall i call   102.34759508656677
two broke from the heat of the fire   113.59933279663616
we will read and sign the contract before we separate and this evening madame de villefort shall accompany valentine to her estate where we will rejoin them in a week   59.458613470558745
he will have had the glory of having saved his king cried winter   143.8047372996892
ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of them they have no time   130.36025988514388
don t you see that raoul is in love   140.46628573113503
you have said my lord   144.26757886626547
besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us   104.7023297292801
that i am not forced to learn english   111.08211073718743
but instead of your son s blood to stain the ground mine will flow   133.78395675698718
for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this mazarin would have you hanged   132.68415018419242
you will retract this assertion will you not beauchamp   73.18515702282446
the king the duc d angoulême   156.62012577995014
didn t you see that monsieur d artagnan mounted with difficulty   40.551644611585914
an innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or bad   44.5903515350647
this measure somewhat reassured bonacieux   131.16104589012468
that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion   83.80459413213183
i who was looking on an eager and curious spectator i who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy i who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course i was watching and bitten to the heart   148.94012439321844
come come cheer up my dear father   191.06551201982808
but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower   176.13133445183365
and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the family   98.69764155179287
reply to them my lord said felton   129.35974042392968
i pardon you for my blasted future my lost honor my defiled love and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me   18.195913060900182
but then we are lodged as you perceive   114.52879470378424
then resumed he mad desperate determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything honor and happiness my poor brother returned to lille and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place surrendered himself and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison   163.1695558889328
my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women   60.33920620562189
then it passed from his face to his hands   117.59201481701258
and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it   74.44564655605541
now we are alone dear aramis said d artagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchet s horse   64.44341938743021
on the evening of the 4th of september m   143.32373026165817
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn   128.42817307153996
yes we will fly   63.91979883485405
for the last time will you come   104.57035425008242
great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with wax lights   149.26007062123682
i believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said d artagnan   91.50846591567436
they get their information on war from warriors   105.48007410965334
fortunately as we have said edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women the wound soon closed   56.68017507964261
perhaps is too much said d artagnan smiling   107.18548035481835
then indeed we are lost   100.41243760093201
debray said château renaud   166.9303944393839
in a moment the valet de chambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the day before   128.22502849723287
i am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the puritans   80.7484601913039
and that is mine also said the curate   97.35111523113255
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence   190.69113767120672
it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours   85.20005417643854
debray stretched himself upon a large couch and madame danglars passed into her dressing room with mademoiselle cornélie   117.56233029070002
this was a question the young man asked himself whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover   132.42573821282622
i am a criminal as it appears   163.33037918545756
i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away i suppose to the spaniards   72.77689565640884
they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette   74.56398089977696
if i am guilty if i have committed the crimes you accuse me of shrieked milady take me before a tribunal   158.24964976273696
and i am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward   92.01649999366637
it was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it   64.77884233237363
and of what are you so sure   112.86294103020488
with the opera the jockey club and other diversions can you not amuse yourself   77.72843398859317
bertuccio knocked the door opened and the concierge appeared   169.48339647677716
and you come   133.20203614919575
i go to morrow my friend replied d artagnan   117.25779605476244
d artagnan and his companions remembered their audience and as they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be lost they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates   209.72207471112068
captivity has subdued me i have been here so long   53.39347787886362
deschamps the family notary   120.6135954016333
he was incessantly attacked by them and the superior to whom he had confided this misfortune wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them had advised him in order to conjure away the tempting demon to have recourse to the bell rope and ring with all his might   129.9123115076291
the different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another without uttering a single word   112.18336517496799
raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out the spaniards   142.94957101635657
oh said he that is life to me   135.0220581758039
no indeed said d artagnan   202.57304607474353
he opened a window and leaned out to listen   70.56885415855179
from the salon they passed into the bedchamber   116.41508855992785
screamed lord winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the plain   116.38825716514327
barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which valentine had filled   58.88225217748821
without reckoning monsieur added planchet to his master s audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to him   30.942734880908944
be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing   130.63756758680387
planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway while grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable undertaking that by five o clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready   78.82401970708923
30253m what a bad calculator you are   184.6943444710016
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence   130.77759584037386
are you there   158.74757774709522
gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor   72.55199997356087
a quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the barrière saint martin   175.59754092016735
bertuccio bowed and was about to retire   67.94753102225746
la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered   51.349295731689
but let us wait a little and reflect   107.28202613032636
d artagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the cloak   111.3699406795619
then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the names of all those who either in his political career in money matters at the bar or in his mysterious love affairs had become his enemies   141.1374048548569
de saint méran had always expressed a desire in case his death happened during his absence from paris that his body might be brought to the family vault   44.0832717405126
and we place ourselves at your orders   82.12164013883218
nothing is impossible   133.35987944464534
the poor girl under the caresses of d artagnan lifted her head   36.50827536925516
answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man   73.23241648582577
tomorrow morning if you like with the greatest pleasure   12.516243045369052
said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly   42.204665235521034
the tutor followed them   44.71034447405188
the nubian smiled   58.41428920910054
he will very probably come of his own accord said morcerf   113.8464304038728
you know him then   167.68920512302563
they will pass as slowly as three centuries when i am all the time suffering dishonor   96.8843867634176
yes that is true and i confess that i was in the wrong   64.67541739768646
i saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness   176.71753372663414
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses   164.59879175671463
it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand   118.35108458567325
under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing a good action   122.4098539897808
how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed   105.80375139560383
her pose which i must admit was rather free wounded this officer   28.583939833210536
luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto   83.04193970624837
speak i beg of you   98.1518632304458
you reject this means of information then   167.84393774964406
the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence   148.19117629805473
not in the least i beg you to believe   79.93880449462247
he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing   110.0595767565874
i m above that   95.13724643547559
the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness   61.41872260209844
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc d angoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home   158.81149157710053
asked the cardinal on seeing la houdinière return   92.15464231104657
a man in a mask   75.2039480154344
do you know saint mandrier   104.73860762555233
but such is man we always want something more than we already have   110.32016923064022
the breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the host   168.06389660368544
i had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted   135.92600139988735
the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head   94.93712039725312
your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl   79.1282914997496
augustine upon which we could not agree said the gascon   73.58624768011559
what is there we can do for you   30.69937703885816
said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me   132.5981121508202
imbecile   122.43556953671501
he then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols   49.0978465757388
a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him   95.00347455169415
ah said milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether wretched   61.653535017907636
go and tell laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the marechal de villeroy and summon him to me   84.55637440845746
stop my friend i have an idea   56.30687212023578
his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass   84.14744081918522
said monte cristo inquiringly   84.706757628697
and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make d artagnan shudder but d artagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said go demon do what thou wilt   86.49691092486756
then said he write to yanina   144.10234220249066
aramis muttered to himself we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things   115.77416509802465
this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence   102.74559062017273
yes said morrel smiling it was the 5th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved   147.43694144172724
there were landscapes by dupré with their long reeds and tall trees their lowing oxen and marvellous skies   155.8622217573496
the second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready   54.00128953132721
a puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his hands   166.5165038834375
and the door keeper appearing called out with that shrill voice peculiar to his order ever since the days of beaumarchais the court gentlemen   116.06850954056547
thus the greater number of a man s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity   102.18743089907245
but don t trouble yourself whence they come think only that one of the three is your property   156.49279063179938
and now for a broussel good god   65.53040425921412
but i can never escape said d artagnan with such enemies   71.19888481002322
said milady with a smile that belonged only to herself   121.48949888353529
the fact is i have found my father   94.02996509739818
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface   104.36938517910401
they were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with eyes of fascination smiles of love and bright and flowing hair   103.6064108074243
in prison sire   95.23639402538572
you have often heard me speak of them have you not my friend   139.38306513464934
let it be then the day after to morrow said aramis   130.4759865868603
he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham   161.71269684498898
oh queen   93.89973654094683
the count followed her with his eyes   98.43312521772124
penelon penelon   122.45055798896888
i have sought to make of the human race taken in the mass what you practice every day on individuals a physiological study   53.73417257286102
herself   144.52402281972377
is it come yet   118.33470408492204
any other woman were it the queen herself i would send to the executioner   127.59012774288239
said mercédès   99.34802126989187
am i allowed to repeat it   152.4415248172873
i he said   126.04266307069024
but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle s robe and spend all your time reading your breviary   111.82029749849094
at what age did you leave greece signora   136.07995138161218
my mother is not woman but a woman   127.561872022674
the baroness ascended the steps   65.03037046639619
the lions den chapter 108   76.15194169036735
volume two 20009m 20011m 20019m chapter 28   145.377458139456
what were you doing   168.81349632810702
d artagnan and porthos obeyed   106.94793308612981
some manfred some lara some werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society   128.10256136846016
it was now his turn to look about him   160.1958917602924
but you will not stop to have your wound dressed   205.53864023935105
he did not then think of the carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one can not incline one s self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory xvi   101.33244574405975
yes and important   173.1471024690347
the walls were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the dead   93.80084285968218
your majesty is bored   150.23189771043286
nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice i think it is better not to make them   196.6936665856816
and now of louis philippe   77.89510809190774
and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word   138.30447847055663
they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man   142.5373624305789
after finishing this letter raoul felt more composed   119.81840267385675
count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me   156.75814103319385
madame replied athos do not injure the vicomte de bragelonne do not ruin his prospects   166.03114753336706
no sir he is dead   104.42867080836956
in the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each other s arms   66.38437101390953
and approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box   36.76833800533133
you can not understand the position we are in   132.64690291623126
mademoiselle d armilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugénie one of the tableaux vivants of which the germans are so fond   152.7848550070874
you who only wish to live like a retired baker   156.96310198904425
and who is the man   75.63264462630306
journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in company   139.92673643008192
on his part aramis wrote a long letter   158.95630907110245
peppino obeyed and franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall   141.67928515414837
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges   39.1873983438213
but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past   98.51479231935794
after which his majesty grumbling entered his apartment   94.403113290318
the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning   113.64042012695248
oh no no not yet he cried   116.76927964430193
he leaped towards a dressing room near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailor s jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair   132.71983710632102
but to resume my story   158.17908328321647
i must have time to file through these bars   73.99986058716362
but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debt if indeed there existed one and i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject   170.04955908697545
let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage   169.45923110873585
the weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air   126.49222712873237
you may torture torment kill me but you shall not have my signature again   115.49572800860501
d artagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench   60.322695303018264
oh lord no   95.86859127122706
the valet re entered   121.70206590963592
meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was   60.80620888122007
the truth was that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed teresa toward another part of the garden   42.708189508780066
the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number   45.83023286939033
that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil   90.50410388197085
is he not a man of good birth   173.7437139757077
it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious   102.1308294631608
that montague is in the bastille   144.9262787318305
indeed the jailer antoine told me one connected with this very dungeon   99.64233317391454
bonacieux darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person   138.61956118807615
said the young woman supplicating him and clasping her hands together monsieur in the name of heaven by the honor of a soldier by the courtesy of a gentleman depart   72.4611852332429
he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition   37.309207044645234
if you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not so   67.12179954923323
certainly continued monte cristo i make three assortments in fortune first rate second rate and third rate fortunes   100.71498504895867
the breeze had been so light all night they had made but little progress   61.552152799143606
and therein consisted the infamy replied milady   111.601859617781
he kissed it and then as he reflected that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death   166.13752587640388
the other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay   149.15367441419332
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her   146.498440077179
weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase   143.21076765235813
yes monsieur replied d artagnan   101.84348761547618
said d artagnan with the most sentimental air he could assume can you be cruel enough to put such a question to me to me who from the moment i saw you have only breathed and sighed through you and for you   100.12108954432105
the son of a shipowner   218.95880439427225
and she slipped a ring from her finger onto d artagnan s   13.255531779159341
i have a presentiment that we shall   66.00776783772926
cried jussac for the third time   55.684485344320365
give me your hand and let us go to the minister   87.02043054204634
well well said monte cristo quietly i see you wish to quarrel with me   183.4825974317783
tall or short   143.4125809464022
oh do not confound the two eugénie   50.674783920609144
here it is eleven o clock   55.77432367489422
your power is great i know   71.44660583368514
we are not in the time of malatesta and castruccio castracani   60.45418080868606
emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make julie decide immediately made him reply   132.5949858838409
remember that   95.38951687812097
louis above the order of notre dame du mont carmel and st   129.0355278657897
i shall be on the king s left and as i am the chief person threatened remain at the coach door to the left   92.25720487402575
start start   128.2539483226865
he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout   77.90386830835303
de château renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance   151.987236487696
villefort pushed or rather forced the door open   73.93109681028247
yes giulio she said proud and happy   108.97045032101117
you do not answer madame   61.85954066895831
milady started with joy   0.9993354208321961
i went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which i concealed under my pillow   184.39483536152278
said morcerf laughing   239.29157435629332
monsieur cardinal is indeed a privileged man   129.88917679257244
thanks for your devotedness gentlemen   115.17144624770462
my poor eugénie you must conceal your passion for the fine arts   77.31744042735124
i have no horse said d artagnan   25.15340033505359
by the queen s almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring   18.277906400708304
second porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh as the englishman without making any further resistance then surrendered his sword porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his carriage   59.22044880822163
d artagnan and his friends   174.59464295631966
and this conviction restored his strength   76.07153768800381
in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him   90.19633010455816
ah you do not love me   113.10916491884738
such felicity seems above all price as a thing impossible and unattainable   156.3233681542314
but with that perfect self possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria dantès coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation   146.1427666853918
these two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into pills   71.85208529872345
and when you know will you tell me   191.07530248654794
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness   135.06649370727115
thy god shall teach thee to repent   117.14084942925744
approach then said the messenger or i will come nearer to you if you prefer it   37.81516363258416
that great man who was so revered by d artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back   113.54305294008164
the english turkish japanese hindu laws are as familiar to me as the french laws and thus i was right when i said to you that relatively you know that everything is relative sir that relatively to what i have done you have very little to do   132.27455321895494
the queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was   156.07310045707402
bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous gestures   31.102988301495586
answer frankly   88.07197826566555
you only mentioned four persons   79.42283140936573
yes i do sir   206.34997260499884
without your aid continued he repeating the count s words i should have been a dead man thrice dead   211.19192665820077
thence introduced into a half subterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment   99.14129027648525
yes but to morrow morning to morrow we shall be at boulogne   80.68812447998437
have you lost your heart   124.1979029946818
but really it is a useless precaution   101.82578486031342
provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience   132.0964738309909
when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winter to quit paradise for earth heaven for hell   150.67158623396543
nineteen returned dantès   152.94187081795394
and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution   136.4691637955188
but he was strangely deceived and his error was not of long duration   175.94105624419535
but the moment is come to keep your word   158.67408632506687
morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses   79.24086020069495
we must look about us   123.38474878966242
this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men   70.67012860282063
the valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded   106.42513671374367
now madame said debray delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker there are still 80 000 francs the interest of this money in my hands   140.9841598243317
will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business   75.04350252545477
that s unworthy   51.28198876182733
for until now no man has found himself in a position similar to mine   86.93575502187744
what a flavor   127.19599465910824
if it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that   112.09115989231638
the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which morcerf had formed no previous idea   67.07819293766747
you know about that   120.96265296880271
then he bowed a second time and retired   82.679717106028
therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects   160.10028969511166
as mademoiselle de scudery remarks   122.64452764291782
as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholics all in the name of religion he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic sometimes a huguenot   100.3293958710311
i have found a horse   55.12665607525071
what am i   144.31987082273827
ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this one s display of reason   107.05530693689224
you who know rome better than he does   108.15733380997938
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service   89.2854987302976
i had but one wish   76.96611717392258
discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in france   167.09550463868237
what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go   138.88157646553094
so the matter ended for the abbé faria   209.522057352547
brave rash and enterprising this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts   110.26809478597335
there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event   98.5090818252588
they passed into the eating room a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen   130.8272925535096
next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the louvre inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of m   75.79158186946529
i asked said athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure   98.57716394924651
the count bowed   104.29291614457011
mousqueton also attracted attention   81.57690853193441
andrea cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that question   101.80113938064557
but unluckily mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests at a high price   37.56507198706856
for you are the only young man to whom i have hitherto spoken as i have done to you   129.24620259500787
you see plainly he is not dead   212.31934249174455
i am added the king taking a handful of gold from la chesnaye and putting it into the hand of d artagnan   78.16169832517393
we are coming nearer to it now   112.05572263664979
i have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which d artagnan traveled   127.31074216230219
for everything   135.70786869708888
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for d artagnan   166.84141981790194
that s very simple replied athos   175.79008737139975
my fifty recruits from the chevalier d humieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks   99.47980372365281
i always said that d artagnan had the longest head of the four said athos who having uttered his opinion to which d artagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed silence   149.178268123036
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse   36.86401159885483
cried d artagnan i will be there ten minutes before twelve   112.4267345845677
replied the duke   162.55354443445452
his voice went to my heart observed julie   176.5912572621602
and his name was fernand   129.31033713322245
i your son as you call me i will not let you   90.19895271006797
milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom   89.90012497668033
ma foi no returned albert   148.62568996519713
it belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us   134.52216700975168
porthos opened his eyes in amazement   82.21598604530647
every frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat   74.42688512924485
my maid then entered with a light   139.8718919823407
when supper was over blaisois entered   153.8535460635462
come let us see what you know   203.15250276808393
now you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity   10.838272770010136
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count   65.49737870266856
israel is dead but he is avenged   177.41481467675254
bonacieux from the convent of the carmelites of béthune   87.4712284240994
with 200 francs   207.0347407620257
your address at paris   128.61152911866915
in what a tone you speak   178.90139988352928
we understand each other perfectly then   72.68655760736905
you shall be my body guard   123.16233477745752
never monseigneur   107.72005503543376
and in a separate group might be distinguished m   136.14623522545935
hear me athos said d artagnan   92.26116414160886
madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful   162.10269906206642
d artagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of mousqueton whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress   2.0374825913829966
i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone replied morcerf but i am reluctantly obliged to confess i have nothing further to communicate yes stay i do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count i heard the sound of a guzla it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own   103.35846428263972
but my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost   115.52672736078794
i have a letter to give you from the count   141.46476811263008
the hôtel de la trémouille   81.34405421059975
i was   140.66679460539902
but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the hôtel   150.2710473137446
who brought it into this room then   115.26482761388802
well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right   113.49620562910336
the valet announced the vicomte albert de morcerf   93.0800959406792
i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron s banking establishment   165.58541299134916
steps approach i go adieu   149.25208110462495
we want money for our return to paris   153.82938942559255
he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move   89.06893010542552
and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god   76.54840854834868
for at present i can not say that i have seen anything extraordinary   76.46754245444802
indeed my dear friend said m   113.08288633758319
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn   72.85329730277358
in a couple of hours he returned   131.7892549246425
in a short time the two unfortunate beasts who had not eaten anything since the morning made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged   88.19789857224114
d artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was silent   122.51392637404012
it was a name that too often resounded in her majesty s ears and too often vibrated in her heart for anne of austria not to recognize it   98.34921563571689
the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three   71.82865703695194
the memory of richelieu annihilates me   199.1127556770363
you have forgotten then   149.79531650363026
by your misfortune   140.4577051697401
everything with him was multiplication or subtraction   147.75759794555063
cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself   184.64901024520353
come there can not be too many   176.20832122714603
i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard   160.74399200241638
and who confounded unknown lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors looked on at this scene comprehensible only to four persons the king the queen his eminence and himself   55.23191962477813
for the rest as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days if porthos were still at the great st   163.86247101137076
and in order to spare you all the annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing i send one of my officers to meet you i place a carriage at his orders and he brings you hither to this castle of which i am governor whither i come every day and where in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other i have prepared you a chamber   115.24396220532317
it is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me   163.68571956835888
the road was long but the horses upon which d artagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux   125.97105902304263
i am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me   71.09333536577225
your song is as dismal as a de profundis   146.25308654957405
albert turned towards haydée   81.47470998779421
there said he demand thy child of carlini   188.90209148759124
thomson french via dei banchi rome   103.60229178297901
he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert   155.9804397868238
come said he to himself be a man   197.17555667482873
but not until two o clock said d artagnan with the same calmness   103.48440808276568
it is much more convenient at paris when anything can not be done you pay double and it is done directly   236.89323503930646
no no it is useless stammered m   102.80696149277391
what were you doing at the moment you were arrested   63.771691725398014
then her brow darkened   219.03056534494323
my way is the way of all gentlemen and i know only one way answered athos haughtily   123.61569764056212
port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by d artagnan and himself   133.92285304287728

over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and manner of boucher   95.13229562563771
in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace   67.72671786701602
grimaud seemed to him an antinous   149.6974736131502
since the 28th of february 1815   158.48941063513038
there is a providence   131.45504403524032
they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent   122.06753517373662
la ramee became therefore the duke s dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper the shadow of his person   146.1186154935495

charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none   98.39769183168721

the sound was heard by the people about ali who instantly opened the box door   52.49902549312085
at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani s a well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia   119.60136732854065
bonacieux he ran full of joy to seek his comrades whom he had left only half an hour before but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied   83.33890943945411
the stranger went out   31.818456422205273
he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm   115.09281922840921

his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious   186.45218241430007
i stand in need of being taught and consoled   83.3936404658768
where have you been   50.16441878674172
said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man s ears   208.10939368692797
aramis is mildness and grace personified   65.67898043918274
ah he exclaimed that woman became criminal only from associating with me   75.86568505757663
monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you   79.03699045592268
see he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught   163.93635879160627
well monsieur do you know who this great lady is   111.12138289531346
well my captain said porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against six   205.4655642822154
do you know my friend i find one thing very evident in all this you distrust me   124.9806694640447
why thus it is replied dantès   186.09747155166792
that of rouen   183.597205925795
and she made a sign for kitty to leave the room   128.25350519350292
hush gentlemen here is the court   252.1417860909789
imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i don t know how long to the amount of 800 000 or 900 000 francs during the year   21.752581392805098
the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated   169.57747706661846
what do you wish for   80.54438100160633
i shall return immediately   140.21461040385677

good morning lucien good morning said albert   51.01843228553484

and yet you said he had money   139.24308830101262
the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce   211.62081215716725
first here is the letter   86.400234595666
yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it   65.44254753922499
the procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m   143.24195873853057
but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered   132.78658651208644
cried blaisois he is lost   179.17849938754182
athos stopped   88.92954999830141
then you had better come with me   84.47099260008798
it is a rock   99.8683104360662
mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like automedon of antiquity   99.61662456925146
come calm yourself and reckon them up m   157.78480295962248
but i confess i always thought you jested   62.2226591820139
we will lay your case before the commandant of the post   50.672540874708105
but after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter   121.97814096088584
dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer   216.75146724445094
i will take two poniards and give one to parry   195.31841978582207
the exclamations the insults addressed to benedetto who remained perfectly unconcerned the energetic gestures the movement of the gendarmes the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance all this lasted five minutes before the door keepers and magistrates were able to restore silence   128.9477751555127
tis i who am too soon   80.68495906978785
she suspected what the letter contained   110.38963609940592
he is well behaved   114.76889646227689
which is not the part of a gentleman   121.17050787266035
as i had nothing more to do at versailles i went to auteuil and gained all the information i could   182.39709686792625
but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude   141.9390112346148
through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement that was all   108.75957949156518
i can t see   132.0252486206539
bowing under the weight of twenty four years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of château renaud or of any of that group   105.63675225848701
yes my lord pentecost   45.13967461410812
drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the apartment   135.88732699157435
de villefort are both coming to this dinner   39.39254685016408
impostor repeated villefort   130.95351086367782
on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand   143.92348729809208
d artagnan said aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance   171.1952252202807
they will be the very men for it   71.57463459557852
he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres   189.49978020608557
you won t forget the boy sir   114.44150900328573
yes i promised you   117.87452202078907
what horror   128.98478031799087
chat between brother and sister during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door close a shutter and draw a chair near to his sister in law s fauteuil milady anxiously thoughtful plunged her glance into the depths of possibility and discovered all the plan of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen   101.82128632930879
i arose   160.24090657518306
you want a pretext do you not   106.51874625622494
the lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table   106.50242836956298
at length providence has done something for you   116.77473299455049
after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening   119.41949277189997
but tell me what   128.6382627902066
and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it   48.080640328408236
scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared   123.17565017671566
his voice had become rough and hoarse   186.58077912270824
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude   120.71588551691623
do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris   129.85939032631552
an instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared   133.79221892019427
i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said d artagnan   55.506499187993384
the young girl s lover was in cucumetto s troop   95.01506901694553
i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming i am giovanni bertuccio   102.42472240877305
on perceiving the count he rose quickly   126.78773926017836
thank you said andrea   103.69661252647525
he wished to enter it as a conqueror   37.056415988573804
she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources   137.0630312021982
lord de winter came toward five o clock in the evening   61.22463229196594
why edmond dantès and myself were intimate friends   63.67346200693331
take this letter said d artagnan   172.62618885884288
may i not drink to your health and you to mine   48.657017648418034
for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream   146.05896326690365
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them   62.41761498677534
50233m i am entirely yours count   18.0848019962218
but she always laughed at me   190.7242667967596
but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another   71.87530381506443
on my life   83.19955622699133
she must know nothing of the matter   235.8181157975178
but my lord returned la ramee what would you do if you got out   54.1499716576969
at nine o clock then be ready here at the hôtel i will come and take you   106.99750377384782
you can write it yourself   150.19436859836935
monsieur monsieur   104.43425442436147
leu being not far from that locality   173.18459295467585
he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east   131.9373322744111
how attentively he looked at you   131.48025571091702
yes said athos doubtless you would commit great follies   92.79430702277085
what are your grandmother s symptoms   144.71159025477135
but after his illness grace touched him and he determined to take orders   154.6875615034432
dear me   150.54379487050136
approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking something   125.33817388556682
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step   17.865011226054136
but said valentine timidly does all the father s shame revert upon the son   64.49350576152702
i was charged indeed with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for rueil when seeing monsieur de chatillon charge an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his side   110.47629900978195
it was his cornelius nepos that master edward was repeating when he referred to king mithridates continued the count and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him for your son is really advanced for his years   75.6504934367012
the abbé busoni said la carconte   129.4586881188865
40044m general d épinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell   5.685930262894544
murmured he between his teeth   61.4821959390868
the fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch to which it had retired to die of old age   235.94953799543813
advancing he is advancing   95.15258101330765
our family although still rich for my father s income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence   89.24394670624719
de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be   151.70789094961188
save the queen   195.68083306196883
at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams   95.1319469839249
you think of every one   52.010513654730325
sir my right hand correspondent redoubles his signals   178.28655663575557
it was proposed to you to come blindfolded you accepted   89.59839991434211
he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a mark the trunk of some old and moss grown olive tree that grew on the sabine mountains   177.56870020658255
well what is pentecost to me   4.2841718705820995
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on   119.08242734538797
i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently   148.99674374461975
instead of putting the letter in the post which is never safe i took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to paris and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess himself   102.64275382712634
i can discover and explain to you my grandfather s thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject   127.96703456543142
the day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but meat   172.04851394490913
andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy five thousand livres per annum   122.50633731195478
and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance   120.28469889048418
but unfortunately those were all good pieces   114.14135129016769
it is sacrilege to struggle against so many things my lord   115.01268052264847
the servitor opened the gate and walked before planchet who made a sign to d artagnan   18.062318894233485
but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at   76.68694509690809
besides i shall only take the time to go and return   141.2776828923452
but she waited in vain   172.75770117389428
i imitate neither manfred nor anthony   114.37071621330342
she escaped the cruisers of both nations and arrived at boulogne without accident   91.10850860897575
madame de lannoy then is of opinion that she gave them to buckingham   143.33360682246496
stand aside   169.0658225895554
yes i once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200 000 francs   121.63270839127274
to do her violence without doubt said athos   105.46863446698242
d artagnan remained silent   165.92907460091362
it concerns me much said d artagnan since you can not marry madame without my consent and since and since   91.36700133241371
he did get out nevertheless   41.859625396333854
it was hardly a quarter past six   126.75719135352273
cried tréville   178.36101546123945
these were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village   109.48256708204927
he returned to london at the first sound of war   112.56121606309588
he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment   153.9221176138639
but today the vow expires   104.03875966872913
the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night   128.36534937697104
with the duke s aid they already considered themselves invincible   113.39016876218628
but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people   129.9064769022794
said morrel intoxicated   169.95014202842648
good day sir   115.90166398132462
do you know count that persons of our time of life not that you belong to the class you are still a young man but as i was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year   117.04190673197834
morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew   97.59561054476256
if they were not yet to be seen it was because the road made an elbow   126.33715649460842
grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully   101.1377865395053
but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his house   148.8614232902698
have i not been there once   188.0230845209922
that is somewhat difficult my lord said rochefort with a smile   112.03617117632494
on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied d artagnan without his sword and the three musketeers armed   84.02452694045448
oh i will be revenged   172.07858872057062
athos took her hand and kissed it   70.38144045435082
yes raoul replied the count   131.6774820837647
grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence   114.7603840392872
yes i know that said d artagnan and you mentioned it to me   59.504415148883
he has orders to do so   59.48559408287817
i reply my lord tis but little as certainly i shall not go alone   148.84280644652418
pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to the door and began to scratch and bark   100.8847199957167
at the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise her head and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried dear madame bonacieux open for me the little door on the alley and i will come down to you   132.91999161009542
monsieur the duke said m   99.7860643330558
but we held better ones at la rochelle with athos and aramis   66.97993736526738
it was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the english regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in advance   133.55584212532037
but how will you get me out of paris   109.59935493778093
how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child   78.86875029496885
but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments   69.89215386939853
i rely on your friendship to assist me beauchamp if contempt has not banished it from your heart   95.62877686268665
for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance   68.90970949857692
he rejoined this woman   14.021714820068553
say so at once   70.02975825588494
he might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a frenchman   84.77998979646135
why he pleases me in spite of franz d épinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world   137.18869274479766
he was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis   61.29886144293786

let the prisoner be brought in   97.84959060434703
good heavens what are you telling me   107.96948190733568
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report   97.45769520312251
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying you promise sir that s agreed that i shall find you to morrow at charenton   171.35263505934688
the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard   27.993157773393847
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same time   169.8384858977935
consider said aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven   153.0882734076738
when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear   138.9015943134163

for andrea rondolo   144.96452297033989
but it is d artagnan that will come   108.93433210734862

de tréville as he has ended by styling himself in paris had really commenced life as d artagnan now did   93.43319006464154
cried milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert swordsman   80.94565079996102
you know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor broussel the father of the people   146.10587309084332

when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons   126.21923834502704
life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a smile   99.89351597501481

two months and a half elapsed in these trips and edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman   92.24152400451177
but we must be going   63.1421199180497
i never knew till now the delight of speed said morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow   106.96147601730999
all at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door   112.9539483445925
the host opened   93.32918648857168

said beauchamp to château renaud   79.5120364535313
de tréville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the queen   163.80212191036617
the soldiers looked at dantès with an air of stupid curiosity   131.61213625300414
you are a poisoner   125.72872519062973
the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters   163.33846386974088
and how does he behave towards travellers   159.32509631873546
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain   102.91870055828082
the jailer was right   130.3919622911327
athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d artagnan was shaken in his conviction   74.98756355339279
oh i shall always love you   111.37000330774679
and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned round   140.39606121070324
listen to its dictates   150.54475648503092
the money is nothing   125.67170669068645
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends   138.42018231833424
but then you would be close to the sea   144.35003156940195
what you have just done is beautiful it is grand   148.4431515449433
monte cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips   98.48327340694672
we shall not all arrive at london   133.99331646342972
that it seems as if i had always known you and always hated you   88.301828468565

he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit   145.05028101962472
but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants   143.49291871099982
a musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them   131.18863580995378
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand   99.17841731512993

milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life   109.27823728292474
still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and hungry   199.46832689633237
our readers already know how he was recognized by d artagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four musketeers had given fresh activity to their journey   108.80414816591191

valentine opened her eyes   48.19227081519094
you have an excellent memory milady   54.58647058431862
the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father s faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death   171.66099509524867
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil   195.12205071142847
what occupies him in england   154.15661725946444
and then resumed d artagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it   49.50019745046798
remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored   157.79650167433363
it seems that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless   190.80063376264425
and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours   179.81308827595018
accordingly it was admitted to the presence of anne who silent and lofty as ever listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies   113.31564219253977
she was within three steps of the bottom   72.24624188270263
he started when he saw renée for he fancied she was again about to plead for dantès   145.70665852340636

then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep   101.44611048422607
this horrible place contained fifty cells   114.71274089223706

because the fifth is dead as i hear   11.830998230607094
monte cristo bowed without making any answer   169.43752492550095
so bitter that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste   18.79806141776318

the contract three days after the scene we have just described namely towards five o clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between mademoiselle eugénie danglars and andrea cavalcanti whom the banker persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the count of monte cristo s house and the count was preparing to go out   144.38786004430827
then turning toward m   99.1055962301257

her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her   56.935528615748055
and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent   183.42749555299412
for three days ago i posted from marseilles to paris with all possible speed half desperate at the enforced delay   119.0189253685638
therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brother s account   133.76515635401677
but can we travel forty eight leagues in eight hours   156.4447360866252
not only in the same hotel but on the same floor   92.38238512185714
sandy hills about dunkirk from which it derives its name   142.04764737367668
but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone hush   126.49653416407585
perhaps i am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to mazarin   161.63113900404258
and now once more adieu said morrel   91.28361248169534
and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine   164.3013133795954
and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south   105.33298119356019
what do you say to this project   3.8338351945340605
at what   65.04113399047003
the doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder   160.0069621957092
come down   169.01901753991973
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon   130.18299996846793
on perceiving monte cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love   83.87189527203596
the life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the sum total of his own desires   81.2552508225486
d artagnan was then in her power   112.23076572201178
well no not very   169.4027053179231
that was to follow her   48.68576854351765
but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards   183.48525850848844
go on go on replied d artagnan laughing heartily   107.67072491580616
the penknife   83.06996054720898
this calmness of busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered caderousse   177.39278024569225
he lives at the bedford tavern greenhall street   213.43927830639967
they knew the count s energetic and violent temper   155.7531339415865
yes as far as i am personally concerned   166.4726626508222
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint honoré   142.2289831387514
the picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping   77.75663248393064
d artagnan bowed and went out   37.28198140440281
at bourges   136.68405233456065
d artagnan himself was moved by them   117.60260457470027
by no means my dear porthos   57.10757432710523
gondy sprang to the window and threw it open   181.95668056621207
but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as a proof   121.47410878302355
for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart   117.12290796944185
a glance was exchanged between athos and aramis   112.18613324012951
have you made inquiry   175.43397742227444
take advantage of all and live happily and long   160.43609005608081
it is fifteen years since i gave up the office   172.85743575768606
instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise i will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons   96.99365487665123
oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied madame de villefort with all a mother s real firmness   151.07113432038733
if one of them comes to my side asked porthos must i kill him   158.51947235017673
it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least   144.34088614207698
bonacieux was the very life of d artagnan   115.5173891064307
do i wish to know that he gives advice   140.78030107684629
i must find them within three days   174.14397305811565
now let us return to the first   76.8553341604705
go sir replied the tutor   92.08747591860309
but this dinner was not intended for you alone porthos   133.28973894771894
but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the half uttered bravos expired on his lips   78.65571185182365
molière or beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it was precisely because i was not that i had cured my patients   169.16149655443417
said d artagnan but only his lantern   113.15676557000936
edmond you have a very handsome mistress   142.06715586288396
i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else   37.08816172153979
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended   180.67228113044345
i can tell you nothing more at present   124.72139102851521
franz returned to the manuscript and continued sir said the president you have been invited to join this assembly you were not forced here   122.86151760820792
god was still in his heart   160.77011713190285
aramis went to cromwell s desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis   89.85253787644555
and why when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed might he not also be   109.00406569393553
do you think that likely   143.59216330346914
but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me   165.3353457372627
and milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips   120.4718414852385
for the man we are looking for is the chief   142.47024057013883
that is another thing said porthos   98.66122906211496
and we shall see then who can speak the loudest   101.23507975619926
the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished   139.27210756186307
whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain   181.9765248017901
and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man   144.73658956781836
but you are sure you will promise me this   68.68188575517028
his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin   77.2104118831493
now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me   84.32310264159108
you hear m   112.16999731804466
you are looking for my daughter   114.98564057196769
oh that is charming said albert how i should like to hear my countrywomen called mademoiselle goodness mademoiselle silence mademoiselle christian charity   41.99831371712601
valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult   127.28890477206035
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish   144.07242668815664
the president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm   69.21949530273322
i have no will unless it be the will never to decide   75.43357256510038
then though yourself a servant you have other servants to wait upon you take care of your clothes and see that your linen is duly prepared for you   108.40137783899503
he was an honest man said d artagnan   174.54898000853382
a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue férou on a very handsome genet   164.14564594248074
0323m like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display   161.49565216056794
he delayed presenting himself at morrel s but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him   190.8114387601833
and what name does he now bear   158.72297693098696
azure seven merlets or placed bender said he   117.95439546949258
messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways   62.55062435816833
i dare say you have nothing else with you   139.79396306718616
and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence   138.8736239278887
your friend s lackey was leading him   58.326155535684386
you forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute   31.6293535434897
cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon   76.31730818655927
it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits toward which it is true we have already the saddles   126.95785676191653
albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress a jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat   68.0133772091207
we are in france and i am spanish   163.41001908468797
this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and i don t like to humiliate people   36.75954962620355
well i shall look upon it as an expiation   135.138329212747
madame de villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her son s ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss   143.79747031866992
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly   145.90320829814112
yes said athos and the marechal has often told me so himself   99.95850303646712
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed   138.7832153315439
this guide was our friend peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road   113.90396397447205
let us manage it better   110.11628955555675
i looked upon myself as another judith   136.06306478803486
you see edmond i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my son   76.45691005175512
the officer took bonacieux by the arm and led him into the antechamber where he found his two guards   120.87684900119294
i was promised he should die with me   115.34276170305634
aramis looked first at porthos and then at d artagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look   115.09838109348932
at last after crossing the courts of the palais royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate   66.37707906872501
we must extricate ourselves from this position   122.78795045020208
they took him for you   81.06818642513869
how very astonishing   185.040631952803
i practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world   203.16570224112206
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared   68.36171892822816
it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all   84.23247997695995
cried d artagnan it s quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here   104.41328697938432
well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed that s all   108.37691559419025
resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night   100.57956284292757
this space passed mme   112.71691464707197
the count of morcerf s adventure exasperates the young man   127.62596760309846
so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers   57.37281124704388
it is he whom we must warn   167.86669820333393
do you possess that right over bertuccio   160.41992824189379
and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets   158.84106671675363
at ten o clock the next day they met again   115.02059787868362
louis xiv   136.60799640548137
what weapons   154.7386174244835
it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome   205.94201652061523
these announced the arrival of the queen   128.61497159151057
noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward de villefort   122.37780108795467
there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic   104.49437230860374
and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends   114.23174651500618
a spent ball   64.2061623823223
franz took his hat and went away in haste   27.781183990243875
you come to your conclusions quickly   168.8259735320729
sir said he up to this time and it is now more than four and twenty years since i received the direction of this house from my father who had himself conducted it for five and thirty years never has anything bearing the signature of morrel son been dishonored   178.56486021837426
it is quite wonderful mr   96.72788934058272
but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman   149.12710143255725
keep near me said the latter   162.8564772133379
and was this conference arranged beforehand   113.72999695816932
it was nearly ten o clock   145.8189316173921
a droll way of showing your affliction   133.2018607092433
make inquiries and if it be true oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all i have suffered   150.2840610815118
but with the rapidity of thought d artagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed   167.24302288595342
the queen is so good   92.05260305913218
and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it   123.14402716030966
i hate you and on my word you shall pay for this   87.00653425741564
cried the pretended monk pardon you   80.3247413094933
just so returned franz you have guessed it   131.17452725637523
i have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his nature   192.71689949761947
in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity and apprehended ambushes on every side   122.69086929611056
my lord you are held in horror by god and men   223.35177615632438
the parliament condemned charles to death as might have been foreseen   168.02295180598892
peppino glided first into this crevice   57.29505897120557
the paralytic motioned yes   59.718472131691136
20093m but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said franz   148.3756060920859
tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator and muscular as a spartan he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken   77.50142848459242
you who weep for pleasures fled while dragging on a life of care all your woes will melt in air if to god your tears are shed you who weep   170.6943329039466
i wish there were four said athos   144.93989258799053
anne of austria believed that louis xiii   91.06316387142144
and i for planchet said d artagnan   91.52153295016225
i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till i knew them nearly by heart   90.59979100818552
then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize   159.50902662765594
in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years for change of air   34.7970480083101
i am neither an angel nor a demon   83.0956346892844
the baron was completely roused   140.3104877562056
ever since valentine s dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad   34.105006879751016
yes you are right replied villefort surprised   76.86045494334485
edmond made great exertions in order to comply   108.9218332888604
take my advice leave things just as they are   75.40602868623569
one day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured her   127.85742727859822
you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect   82.19747045557514
and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty   165.5395340563978
think what a figure you will make when you are asked how do they execute at rome   110.77448472301883
as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars   114.16251170698854
and now you will do me a favor will you not   214.53907706377436
no doubt   160.3525014856075
she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and madame danglars was recognized   116.92455730560401
i thought you were earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as facchino or cicerone and i pitied you sincerely as i would a child of my own   39.64376625848843
fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship   148.04819165197796
and if he should he will be told that i have brought a woman with me and that woman is in his apartment   86.83608362112713
there is a man after my own heart   104.42786593503433
should andrea marry according to his father s views he will perhaps give him one two or three millions   106.1607706608552
she spoke some words to lord de winter in english who thereupon requested d artagnan s permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his pardon   102.36264913071517
50241m danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting house   156.58307886573434
asked the englishman   56.816451436791326
0283m to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure   52.73819569128099
and to have ideas added madame danglars   74.07053858644625
but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment   132.07403703700092
conclusion epilogue author s preface in which it is proved that notwithstanding their names ending in os and is the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them   89.30161012178591
she must be a princess then   85.63356105276753
madame de villefort made no further reply   90.49652364668574
i sleep no longer monsieur   110.55005342004064
the procurator s wife hung upon the arm of porthos and in the violence of her grief she cried out monsieur porthos i am ignorant of all such matters   92.92316461904922
0345m some time after it was stated that the comte de morcerf this was the name he bore had entered the service of ali pasha with the rank of instructor general   103.44556746471264
each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them   112.00546383785522
you have talked of me   108.12682670881097
they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him   107.79038981583106
exclaimed the procureur with a haggard expression   131.48019705738415
it is important that he should receive it before eleven o clock   78.35671817797436
sblood   151.91219379061405
his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was for andrea   159.6972245020708
the duke looked at this strange figure with surprise   189.58377766163161
the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity   134.69685211185282
madame said he   94.47929509758988
be enlightened   177.14250422231217
i shall ask him   105.49094698651858

but first interposed d artagnan you must present me to madame du vallon   185.01322751419855
charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own father   125.49158378386903
he will not let me end my triumph in suffering   167.6517599950505
two open   147.82604859282236
it seems like a woman   105.02526717259504
in fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement   17.76636287610549
at villars cotterets he wrote to the cardinal my lord i have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty men   61.63871409603436
grimaud made a sign that he was going away   99.56353289211111

and in that war zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to england and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by swimming   155.9057029618332
said he to athos   176.5493088889326
said he in a low voice   26.658017255983452
take my wealth my fortune my glory all the days i have to live for such an instant for a night like that   108.00070032369113
andrea was short and fat   152.13789055201244
ah my dear monsieur bonacieux you are generous in this matter   27.920903786509328
it is that as i was cruelly bored as you say and as i had the seventy five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed a cast of dice   101.19684213610368
and i said aramis i am alone in the world and have only your majesty to serve   150.6529448592384
you know his business here then   135.50858977355963
and your majesty has employed the son of such a man   185.21025305692484
take care of your horses   143.90464718754745
the cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon aramis and struck a blow that aramis parried with his wonted skill   31.616218296227686
i don t know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was rather rather strong in greek   126.34201074939713
so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf   239.83914324981623
but what is your own opinion albert   133.6212922776569
then turning toward the second musketeer d artagnan said monsieur du verger help me to place this man in a place of safety   109.3506917899442
dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak   127.31735498807026
and running to a table on which were paper pens and ink she hastily began to write   156.58017861215487
well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes   111.8775795686588
excuse me said d artagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry   47.2978455355352
everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow   244.75698264259336
porthos looked at d artagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companion s gascon sharpness continually supplied him   152.4277722064906
at tréport   167.6157225459075
if it is a snare replied d artagnan i shall scent it out be assured   95.55200249794778
exclaimed athos raising his right hand to heaven never   86.75159303991268
then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment   112.72171184238002
returned peppino   65.57450930900899
ah that s quite another thing   102.8440752903129
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales   110.78027483851503
merri st   63.59018858130006
that might give him a poor idea of you   190.15878807371902
and now leave me alone   125.753120958893
d artagnan related his adventure with mme   221.76605081083454
in the king s name   122.46302535833867
you see plainly that i have no sword said the englishman   210.82687857223476
end of the project gutenberg ebook the count of monte cristo illustrated updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed   116.64956078800864
not such a fool as i fancied   86.01301601116116
several horsemen ran quickly to him   85.78338791449333
be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that i may justify by a pretext at least my abandoning my countrymen   93.07948750062808
i will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman of which she is no doubt ignorant   96.2279547611218
this evening s adventure will serve for my excuse   46.66566040353449
the nations took attila who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions that they might be known and acknowledged   92.00638979642235
i don t say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind it s a sure way to prevent it s coming true   172.90654088446925
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat   174.50129840921613
what a wrist   70.34701567985255
and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest injury   127.60570521438531
his heart beat but not like d artagnan s with a young and impatient love   241.81308206654245
the abbé rose took his hat and gloves   75.70667538231653
i am listening   50.951674224291594
morrel is utterly ruined   133.57615319649503
heigh sir said d artagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouse evading women   74.44780521824228
well well but keep whole   124.85772046821273
the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pierrefonds to which porthos escorted his friend   39.642335064376724
the countess made no reply   149.13394756755847
mousqueton followed two lengths behind   59.257031178375
at length d artagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a woman s torn glove   97.55916103334627
on reaching home d artagnan found kitty waiting for him   85.65857021072686
but where to find this man   123.81275971839827
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now   79.91864685880032
to the end   144.27859571302722
when i become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not before be careful about this force open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and i may perhaps revive   102.3891750225273
therefore he knew nothing either of the enemy s numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army   100.93714198451535
i dread this marriage maximilian as much as you   90.9711216937525
what are yanina and its vizier to you edmond   65.45917887140581
a knot of straw in the hat   119.20132513056991
cried his eminence for the third time   49.7091475709893
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced   173.7757356521028
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business   79.63689708711172
ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital sport   103.02220615484659
my friend she is a woman   155.51183536862166
is she french   114.99031002444748
at present i confess that is the thing i stand most in need of   61.0148110758272
is this the same lemonade of which you partook   93.17580407046148
you will see continued aramis that it breathes irreproachable passion   99.97192195251073
not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences   67.08512037303672
sit down there before me d artagnan   35.43449801211054
for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine   23.035493804099275
why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me   151.1012380438738
villefort who did not choose to reveal the whole secret lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness   155.32086705697174
but i wish to remind aramis that he can not quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy   51.443185603046366
everyone obeyed   113.66392058463063
edmond did not close his eyes   113.62086354120645
you can understand our disappointment when arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood which at a distance had quite a gay appearance with its red roof and green shutters we found nothing but a poor wretch bathed ah   59.40156741041651
thought porthos this is poor work   19.73962765731075
cried aramis eagerly   118.46543635963278
and d avrigny approached noirtier   117.06899223961831
i have remarked also another thing said athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched   156.37179286572587
by denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow   95.81592597728391
at a sign from athos porthos and d artagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them   157.03446880759572
some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren   221.73119514076893
behind d artagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red cloak   103.45070431314629
an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall   170.07680681961813
it was considered that you dead the fortune would naturally revert to your brother unless he were disinherited   50.55819768819123
but you my poor child   130.14238678503497
porthos rose saluted his friends and followed mousqueton   73.43339581756729
observed gaetano   175.1332175389368
ah madame replied monte cristo all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki   164.95260597271255
the guide held the door open   189.2233114104905
planchet art thou there   120.85313165337779
well then planchet gallop up to it whilst i tighten my horse s girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the jesuits windows   137.10827042250037
and these men were your friends   206.40959983778117
the puritan then went out   106.2051382447953
then a piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of god   87.4158062720577
athos whose acquaintance i made about that period and porthos who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a musketeer   119.03608222682993
odds fish   80.72955569935843
nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dantès   125.67730214318418
ah this is too much   71.45522562005948
and she greedily read the following few lines my dear child hold yourself ready   134.8591768104433
replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum   114.59048975082688
but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase   202.70109520636913
he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect   64.30023276879189
and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m   146.5854151995172
here it is answered the other   192.6663642491407
at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder   159.71077714823224
cried d avrigny with grief and surprise   149.888801691179
the chateau   172.37495267513233
the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame danglars and eugénie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which valentine was expected   171.99256461747905
yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation   32.82867922968596
france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence   211.73254157388652
does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris   93.9160529039417
this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity   201.86058330877785
i could not help thinking so just now   77.77909404945032
i have let thee perish   138.68623449484804
monte cristo approached her and silently took her hand   180.39619031240207
he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours paris would be under arms   144.61226507775245
i summoned all my strength and courage to my support   78.69060259348066
aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder   85.41957618190617
yes sire replied athos   57.56182163307264
but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality   121.50080953164603
yes monsieur officer stammered the mercer more dead than alive at your service   137.9638253468521
how does he come by his name his fortune   149.8064076695655
i said my good fellow that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included   189.7866911726884
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess   181.2157762910639
peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a torch   154.40662074064278
a torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge   81.9657238288915
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad   108.37826336878084
yes but never with the same advantages said d artagnan in a tone of raillery   160.7521112028794
i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saint martin and gaîté who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren   76.80741923783748
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning   87.98484584868343
carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence   175.65924213969382
as to the commencement of an intrigue between her and m   100.30947421861782
the color mounted to the baroness s face and villefort turned awfully pale   131.90561870938663
rochefort whom he had seen in notre dame   175.3217245091821
one step nearer said comminges putting down the sashes that the interior of the carriage might be well seen and placing his sword on his prisoner s breast one step nearer and i kill the prisoner   132.45008174676425
in short i see you to tell you that we must never see each other again   33.26862222579632
how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did   95.05602761442294
he gave them a tolerable repast   168.3959458470983
i feel myself quite in a humor for it   119.11960610069919
chapter 42   154.94675783880263
i carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one   159.28769658307732
de tréville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground   109.65906840475814
danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wife s this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france   58.70743295233129
the conflict was not long   106.04186440023511
his family will care much about such a trifle as that   143.85074454450077
porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great admiration   196.63544442796714
now there remains the chevalier or the abbé d herblay as your majesty pleases   151.45613875670008
said the young woman clasping her hands and weeping herself at the queen s sorrows   78.52947968470237
thanks my lord i will speak to him myself   117.20460770607744
in fact four men such as they were four men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives   114.98846356432219
but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips   172.7773663916997
the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner   121.87105980716312
that s lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders   117.10669550831595
or on the island of elba with its historical associations   136.58270567602912
he will answer you   159.3903233241838
oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick   65.68127655196031
it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow creatures   83.91506288349449
depend upon it the custom house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor dantès hidden treasures   149.86928188769753
will you dine with me   97.22223218268995
you see then that i speak to you in the queen s name   76.38054992170508
it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte   121.26586384930364
go then and find them   139.4667692152525
the hostess as she entered saw d artagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon d artagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly   141.05943158949162
so owing to your popularity no   143.79041289406484
now you get angry and attack our poor agents   141.10294715765028
i do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures   177.1918261256632
this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure   87.84854356881775
and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond and offered him his hand   112.96574148743414
continued albert   161.0653460267289
ah monsieur mazarin monsieur mazarin said rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether i am too old to be a man of action   227.70285497920855
it is not difficult to divine that after all you have told me   105.45246183826882
cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive   118.15581462271834
how am i to justify it if i am here   147.4389253224989
i have been wrong   71.41820409196863
what time is it then   65.88665155989459
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco17 had done over the moor who would have killed him   128.90282067634595
and rising also he went off at a quick pace   72.20251835812948
shall i go and offer her my services   125.82069571219552
then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his   136.58849384471483
all that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words i poured out upon this man   139.64814499019582
who has taken my piece of glass   75.21756931676157
the door being closed the four friends waited in expectation   116.50595373584274
oh saved saved   87.22249873839408
said aramis he resembles one of dante s damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels   120.87372112482961
jean where state criminals were buried   108.85814995976672
no he will not desert said the king   123.99959120400143
i swear captain replied i   178.89509849563157
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master   101.8161034108134
yes said beauchamp   102.37084223917826
the morning dawned dull and gloomy and villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink   128.59047106031505
and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy   43.039564566610466
elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling bottles cigars knick knacks   94.41479881030534
but interposed monsieur de chavigny it seems to me that pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for mademoiselle de pons   100.26844786684036
and how did this despatch reach you   143.30270533453154
suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him   135.41654715753324
you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called me   63.79121794295392
the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart   162.69890271998565
let us keep that paper carefully perhaps i have not thrown away my half pistole   151.80387598352775
what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego   107.14022673431226
and so closes our interview said andrea to the worthy steward   125.88493927316264
let us try not to jest if we can   48.298651611959585
in five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced cautiously   73.30488912858367
explain yourself   105.38549616033917
well as for me i prefer hannibal   139.595324717424
who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch   156.80221727688368
he passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the samaritaine which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge   134.93255616351456
to learn is not to know   99.8095341321512
you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d hôte of the hôtel des princes or the café de paris   121.32932901079438
the queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what i suffer   78.26367128405894
it was then richelieu s object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to avenge himself on a rival   41.63345754560811
i have assumed the virtues that i had not   155.39583025550564
unfortunately however morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson french who had shown themselves so considerate towards him   87.5305155062463
the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand in whom the grand vizier ali tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence   152.05857573653108
yes sir returned julie   109.123192346633
d artagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice   123.8313227331808
i thought you wished them to forget you   144.59396053722537
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let   163.45493793738223
just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe now entirely deserted   164.9082454088689
that is possible monsieur   51.803655298845186
a troop   177.80409240493947
the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison   164.17918006636359
we are four of us said d artagnan   108.95093535830453
thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on   59.13114198502909
the cicerone sprang into the seat behind   198.20808106829247
why do you do so   91.5486561978665
chapter 98   147.09587527611407
eight or ten   134.67672898433497
but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat   102.51732161672248
one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to reply   113.17383353333767
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg™ trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation   137.17127884804842
it will be easy for you as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other   150.0662249505922
his eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly   142.31704597325233
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose above the water blind as a new born puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton   65.39407096386068
i know nothing about it my lord   150.32360453444244
very likely said albert   149.64023048010176
count andrea cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow   110.74993626169774
morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey   155.9248402428499
in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the door   27.861859630477
certainly at your first request   68.75020649540838
here you laugh   119.00807104553728
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthos s opinion   118.08580735525611
and with the exception of a file i have all that are necessary a chisel pincers and lever   178.01823317179694
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied   106.0858909415645
he was now a lieutenant   168.34216417573944
but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where d artagnan had disappeared   190.25719323395924
perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company   105.74745666597687
take care said madame de villefort the king s attorney is here   139.93936655069814
exclaimed grimaud   96.62347068300336
though danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation   137.77317350361375
what were you doing there   113.74861672366607
they were his friends and not mine   137.53465662229232
at the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat   157.5752703073332
adieu till we meet again   112.60283355664016
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life   172.79865434028937
the bills signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the englishman were paid by cocles with equal punctuality   147.30646397184455
the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors   182.06704134839205
alas sire answered athos your majesty has guessed aright   67.45643516954127
exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure   113.28124878218628
repeated morrel   59.11307630848958
he said to the postilion eh mio caro   138.68347258959457
the next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses   95.86233624860373
d artagnan smiled for he understood that athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret   104.15685538954149
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling   75.73516209573923
at this moment villefort returned followed by the lady s maid   89.51325049079887
yes really   97.03649919931777
place the object which i desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while i examine it   117.99755601057977
it is true nevertheless   148.81520969134797
she will enrich you and you will ennoble her   157.8886228430976
you do not make raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself   54.10755225770415
which road   139.35537580728163
then d artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house   128.1629002211592
sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked   98.28990432584261
he showed la ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with monsieur de beaufort s coat of arms   76.58754718422779
oh cried andrea leaping with joy   100.329959477611
replied mousqueton   166.75726775376253
they had long since passed to dessert and cigars   86.79765676689652
she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrate s study   6.0459089520044955
and whatever mazarin may say once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm   78.00109966838924
and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and double locked   112.51023960364547
we will then terminate this conversation   25.160222135309397
the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest   152.38948616118512
it was the man he called his phantom   120.64282054208861
he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause   119.6260833698161
toward the end of the evening however the beautiful lioness became milder   32.45410857515729
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty   124.82093717393346
only take care that i am not seen through the wicket   115.95371266105701
the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts   76.50965857594763
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer   118.7289448707753
but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter see here it is   126.59970988828363
petersburg the other five leagues from naples   107.62116534735067
why he is made of iron   42.62318339666217
and who is the person whom you suspect   96.64847748470652
he is first a father then a judge   91.82987569061538
silence said the abbé   62.1263517795727
yes the porter   232.6596245714376
so much the better so much the better said caderousse   101.62338621044483
speak then chevalier   90.24363656138271
noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her   82.16264406660085
i looked carefully around   182.19128459196918
repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name   96.83878325534177
what an abyss   160.84333049691614
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions   97.2413680020658
not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great   203.04982467033255
de tréville that s all very well   159.69869535185603
do so then but let it be the last   176.52251677814365
is it not a joke   131.07766809041533
some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the door   81.29074770727564
but to his astonishment the room was suddenly illuminated   139.84714699019358
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here   113.31640004596427
and that name of a town or village is written in her hand   208.8465836845658
as he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this commission   88.17387717809208
he will dine at mazingarbe and sleep at cambrin   164.35180789271237
never mind what he says morcerf said debray do you marry her   164.4474858458742
the four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after m   80.36862049638259
de villefort and the radiant face of mercédès   154.35817809163407
come come continued d arminges to dinner   134.33041700592733
in that case they would have met with more fitting reward   58.37862250790148
go and fetch a physician   76.55849745725195
whilst raoul wrote on thus sir after a four hours march i stop to write to you for i miss you every moment and i am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me   121.37865323817311
as a matter of fact said monte cristo approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence   175.1339386188303
the beggar chapter 65   91.47985014859339
yes but he must make haste   123.08056246758883
what is the meaning of that   89.51185994094065
the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat   135.63747776063286
if that is all it is easily done said porthos   153.04900337081654
inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated   132.22002990274785
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at   121.44687572878136
your blessing your holiness before you go i beseech you   136.68869043312213
when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos porthos drew his dripping hand from the font   112.75811224355063
a sorrowful smile passed over his face   101.10888861010389
in favor of some member of your family   111.60747992613288
i doubt however said la ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness   140.15887223937085
i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box   217.36834861603353
and you are far too exacting   143.1373360281123
d artagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything   94.76662838741728
he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy   101.1803868959733
d artagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water   172.33430596607656
day came   118.54950942898851
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort   143.2477251947462
one would think we had tipped the wink   143.0106004117267
she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror   180.6722731718176
de morcerf the other day   192.72106513513555
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted   222.98850101549328
now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect you   76.23480148867053
and of what malady   90.72457749752559
sir said comminges i am the bearer of an order from the king   67.93692241704974
lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentinels   144.53554189881817
said monte cristo with interest   189.22725948155204
danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the fowl   147.29885456540694
on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem   40.69453432817866
the judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head   127.3349335092798
speak madame   168.73691323633238
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying send on your business those who do theirs at the same time   53.96461863205776
milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will   147.12815183477312
no i shall not kill you   90.16853745032199
sire notwithstanding monsieur duke at whatever price it may be i will have them   63.32869480931754
the mind can see as well as the body   71.1911143492924
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you   116.11767210026943
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea   109.04055872208093
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects   167.08220463138693
said louise with regret   92.90076897542798
then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the cellar   101.30906477936428
count you prolong my agony   164.2309556912386
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library   39.045749825375765
let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to calais or boulogne   221.72461997640602
but the cardinal who feared that bassompierre a huguenot at heart might press but feebly the english and rochellais his brothers in religion supported the duc d angoulême whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant general   106.80009510987631
the whole population was on foot   152.11753005025386
one fine morning the king commanded m   155.36940122306092
he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room   104.3524298194899
rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile   147.33887738247023
murmured julie   74.02669919571022
one plan occurred to me continued albert   115.61139097218975
they have with them two corsican bandits   181.1498514972012
at nine o clock the next morning the drums beat to arms   77.96914270308699
as for my body it is lost   103.45610087312399
that is reasonable said the visitor   113.47575719471955
he again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage   148.2362141666999
madame de chevreuse and madame de vendome have left their names at his door   38.969783035126724
the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms crossed   129.49648017723527
force her door   86.99564014014153
he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor   149.35979342614104
men avenge them   163.426359158125
during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentine s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted   69.43776206545752
the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel   153.613387696024
andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor   111.38017419499982
and since your return to england   90.1331319872414
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him   146.0515869992816
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress   73.75548938456168
an officer approached   89.63846901212898
de morcerf came he would find m   65.54788099757363
a knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it replied felton   115.77369125960941
sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my boy   187.77874592825674
that which i have to say is too long and above all too secret   143.58524682410678
may i go and ask them that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you   128.53493219058367
all the rest is my business   164.24202317703782
married   151.26322900277228
replied buckingham impatiently   69.13082134027806
and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you   185.6373233167476
the young woman looked at him furtively   84.00896530304415
indeed he was all honey monsieur   34.584303353008124
do you understand that my dear franz no horses   86.56069966485451

have you mentioned this death in your paper   172.3293379717675
the duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like st   90.00136505198032
the air they breathed was heavy damp and cold   86.0107084957161
the death of your prince   114.22379119359672
but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason   98.2959185961444

jussac fell like a dead mass   86.25275586281266
my dear aramis you speak like theology personified   155.9594913580013
morrel son   31.91335918104629
it was evident that he shared his master s apprehensions   59.753581179128965
he was one of those english tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling   131.8785976008246
de villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at m   133.5577604289098
you may see matters differently d artagnan and think otherwise   164.87300078663242
a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions   101.36781595384765
very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms   86.909826708867

set to   108.80486087738892
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman s hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years   204.02706502807246
to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of pisani at palermo   95.94478728141733
nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness   38.607353586169864
on entering the rue tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house   146.74593761714965
i wish them to be promulgated immediately   88.8544741020162
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing   148.61308134572954
ah i have come now to what is most difficult   146.66688201053378
but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid   140.67504738531403
a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms   158.46360449591353
you are welcome gentlemen she said   55.435822010417695
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that d artagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you   125.00182823595247
i will say do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself   150.748825357614
it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired   59.607755423422226
d artagnan put the purse into his pocket   83.1271476777973
you chevalier d herblay to his left   121.80572566305803
but she had her son   145.27412994347648
the same as yourself   115.83786525747026
near the barrels stood selim my father s favorite whom i mentioned to you just now   107.71739343356057
who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from boulogne   49.78770883453646

it happened however that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted porthos perfectly   105.31694958766201
each moment s delay is an eternity for me   106.3643092120855
for at quarter past twelve i will cut off your ears as you run   172.30020859894256

a man whose name is franz d épinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them   120.58324249302026
d artagnan was acquainted with villars cotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions   138.30645175103297
the first moments of her captivity were terrible   79.8399685630728
well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you   95.13880634377944
it seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse and was becoming as mad as those he saw   114.63638490006954
the scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened   177.25314319073203
leave me i pray you   106.54587277879139
that i may not be considered as your accomplice   108.5919157829321
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its master s favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish   102.44761787651935
i know it said athos coolly since here it is   120.03131197859713
ah ma foi   155.97240238397467
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil   148.261434300773
oh no said villefort   79.41205698813735
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you   174.08466311620452
the house of morrel son anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of morrel s warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change   109.9048890890199
he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses   79.55295004611251
cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your majesty s service   86.13249589867331
and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs savoring of the man of quality a league off   104.58264084455848
they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented   95.66874212070373
danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for   124.04525941091278
so no more delay no more hesitation   41.148536639905615
monte cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step   116.93588677398753
for myself i want nothing   100.87232687850577
and as he bound her while saying these words milady uttered two or three savage cries which produced a strange and melancholy effect in flying away into the night and losing themselves in the depths of the woods   119.23823523633537
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation   67.56302034409373
you lie repeated the abbé a third time with a still more imperative tone   111.21846904290003
believe me it is only the evil minded who deny friendship   138.23001891796022
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted   61.92864239398954
he was accompanied by two of the yacht s crew   178.73720996225035
then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyone s mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness   134.10521129478678
the night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege   112.85839488699062
my mind was already made up   153.98848858213304
when she recovered her father was by her side   17.119581323541922
give me the pocket book la carconte and find a bag somewhere   128.50426212771958
these are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor   129.72514778358456
we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion   37.328763488635346
you no longer seem to love any of us   143.61817137758288
i am watching said porthos   107.60760853120198
chapter 49   132.10112519543992
now go returned franz or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who is mine also   132.04729728540963
siete italiano   182.79208108854743
we will cross switzerland and go down into italy by the saint gothard   147.49095828941157
we are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all proof   70.67699519001425
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart   18.379986632537566
only of this i am sure i have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me   102.22230327539599
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal s death as a deliverance   171.55647784456679
let us go porthos but let us go well armed   94.6857880443697
50195m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtier s room   123.49606678397193
for everything cried d artagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself thus   133.26253525896237
that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself   160.4426898430585
madame we are yours body and soul   116.73393424412112
give your orders said the three musketeers   103.2214126420142
then he added aloud did he make any resistance   47.65285656755172
we must trust in heaven   126.37332216030342
aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash   10.57069180720518
as to the soldier he only smiled   171.81258362933545
because said debray albert sent this morning to request us to come   90.39717642125275
i study the useful arts   96.65630241588275
well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal a distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal   73.08467919145909
you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry   124.99956847573165
then taking the glass with a firm hand she said drink   105.14996409264495
well i shall see   115.48263136197797
and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day   157.8349285071019
but make no treaty you understand me   110.75737142121385
i hoped to be able to rely upon that   131.31521137195722
after this i will think of nothing but eating and drinking   48.840413392116645
you may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to us   186.1849245764851
you see i travel with them   82.67118140174497
it almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes   122.36770855752962
mordaunt bowed humbly   52.17969528353187
answered another voice which d artagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis   124.89458333877235
that it is i who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de wardes   79.57803841901884
she will however be in the salon in ten minutes   95.66885691748196
i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak   104.50993929214795
the cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince   140.51864518269656
yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders   77.02291106628239
and above all others cried d artagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the cardinal   121.97045585300789
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt   86.51018063425303
we are listening   201.34833351719135
the host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney   78.95344356355056
is it really for us that you mean your attack   55.45979221232321
you will receive two hundred pistoles   76.04812068084749
grimaud made a sign which meant that he didn t see what that had to do with him   132.44035952096732
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will   131.98510890631957
therefore i shall not pledge myself   224.65552334563455
it might be called a magnificent prison   151.463893399224
asked the count again   149.54251268690578
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered   115.27422021238273
if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense   51.74794368078796
a mere matter of precaution answered the gascon   63.486096906931174
if i have committed an additional crime punish me but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad bitter and lamentable then pity me   159.22393989610185
perhaps you know all the earlier part of it   152.1430251743506
oh yes monsieur oh yes   124.90006437157719
merciful heavens   123.38902360698754
he had made up his mind that he would go to the palais cardinal and that he would learn what his eminence had to say to him   96.45130614113825
will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn   51.41553172235113
will you have the goodness sir should you receive news from blois to send me a few lines about my little friend mademoiselle de la valliere about whose health when we left so much anxiety was felt   82.78638982576136
fernand whom you see here is a good and brave catalan one of the best fishermen in marseilles and he is in love with a very fine girl named mercédès   47.80368162397359
saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to puritans   106.21781620584841
oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing   52.73031108738026
you were very much frightened then   128.72949736873477
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness   147.50705575252337
d artagnan d artagnan cried aramis you are killing me   118.7058083549469
ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of madame de saint méran s death   128.6520649402932
what do you mean by having made a stiff   153.34466603639976
exclaimed danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation   135.74885431947632
by the way resumed de winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not milady let this check take away your appetite   141.90475878254617
de villefort s in connection with his attachment for valentine   161.81834553601053
but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation   71.42884690235091
i render a service i do not sell it   68.44730630073121
you see plainly that i listen and that i am anxious to know the end   100.86523964252507
but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony   98.9536990956579
the road led straight up to the chateau which compared to its ancestor on the hill was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the duc d enghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of charles vii   165.0538364478079
but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection   114.8886410210298
you offend the good god   88.226745327861
for my part said porthos i desire to be made a baron   123.55578749919358
then i did not kill him   126.92965969743439
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver general   118.05277146745934
i will go there also for a few minutes said the duchess   130.22962191540185
i have both reflected and decided answered he   104.07214760760304
and how did the thing happen   106.14458710018803
unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france   76.53709643933261
porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to d artagnan to the great astonishment of the young man   115.474266311609
troops   62.79908792672522
very well at ten o clock   113.14327416610071
he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow   124.49342953615984
there were two doors   59.393670259170264
without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to know   93.74331556680197
yes said aramis i saw her also at that time   149.4047530056287
exactly sir   171.021397074643
that would be fair play   82.13266831761794
the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman   131.81148350242324
bonacieux took place   99.14379390639243
added he   87.05284727166065
yes i did wait yes i did hope count and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my heart for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me   65.27851275031901
the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation   166.39776737594585
d artagnan went to the window with his habitual composure   80.35214270605937
she rang the bell and kitty appeared   94.28555753909176
it is no use said the old man there is no wine   189.96486880744607
without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned franz i can not deny that we have abused his good nature all day   16.70226915703425
do not mistake   146.36972045967727
but yet continued the king undoubtedly my haste accuses you wrongfully   129.09507535220493
the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it   119.13015451745014
it was a cold day the eleventh of october there was no inn or chateau in the village and the homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive   109.6266184706387
there was a cry of shut up   194.75807238787905
apprised by beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from albert   133.24905530577624
do you believe it   154.3223910264311
the queen appeared and was followed by the king and the duke d anjou his brother   116.69505771338112
not monsieur d artagnan   122.8132967673766
then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird   75.22691558804965
perhaps yes perhaps no   109.29666649295162
but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money   11.753313940024597
why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine   95.59681219706121
my lord replied guitant i was observing that we live in troublous times and that to day s events are very like those in the days of the ligue of which i heard so much in my youth   71.54499911660818
madame de chevreuse whose name appears so often in our story the three musketeers without her actually having appeared in any scene was still a beautiful woman   20.487305143402352
oh cried edmond to think that in half an hour i could join her did i not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles   120.5687921929962
danglars alone was content and joyous he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the pharaon secure   69.87526062381292
have you not hit upon any   82.0391587617085
he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained almost closed   189.24616780511127
milady clarik received d artagnan ceremoniously   116.72581530922788
you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felon s life might live as other men   55.92016420466541
he has the true military style   91.538109500184
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the door   126.9598297233066
d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned   134.25576639362168
guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an execution in italy   181.8170379524549
you will be well fed there if the hostess remains the same   170.0812276877079
de villefort who was busy taking down some notes raised his head at the mention of this date   139.4364486586445
make less hubbub and think more deeply   178.35828736456645
and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly   214.97197262359515
do you not see   87.77567397378834
i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go   111.11086446662935
cried he regaining strength by force of terror   136.51049871172978
how does it happen then that he is in your service   80.68865487973778
i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his breast   218.004336804773
at this sight and this voice charles was about to cry out when aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of england   96.14294282543476
once only had villefort seen his father   90.1045846846445
oh if you are struck in france if you die in france if i could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death i could not console myself   165.12729767477234
do you then love mercédès   163.6681737694351
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her   152.4109773016248
the count continued i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years   159.64908394671704
bernouin conducted d artagnan to the oratory where he sat down pensively   93.15373905796625
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content   181.21870445247657
questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own   144.12628057585675
well then let us all fly said athos and leave nobody here but planchet to bring us news   263.8081478941807
he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand   129.0390611435306
and with what did you contrive to make that   105.84215183072281
cried the youth   159.28272930083907
come let us speak of your little affairs   175.3995231982375
and you will do right   124.23894692146168
is the doctor afraid that you may be recognized   157.76345910821252
well then said milady i confide in my brother   140.4295155565041
by knocking at his door   131.75986955200358
continued villefort   50.07778617091604
from that moment the old man s eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it   152.25963421643803
from pure zeal and devotion then   99.41155656275512
do you understand it now   170.1117686794576
why vulcan and bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the amount   89.68147699835812
very well sir said comminges you shall hear of this anon   156.9600568467073
have you had any account of it   41.34739233639493
the duke meanwhile recovered his self control   54.400060630145056
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet   154.8339367656081
then he began to search   83.95100811922106
he sent one of his servants to m   62.947451959636496
he replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment   213.77180010084786
excuse my weakness   50.52769708514363
that s it friend   180.06489021473317
no but madame de morcerf saw me   137.05961655673542
you are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her friend   68.92198711823956
he was not deceived   28.804362954153234
my husband in the bastille   138.17247928983542
then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory   122.05938594572353
resounded on all sides   118.0293278899603
danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained   70.42923471452997
you jest sir   110.65918395975224
the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred   180.1530366376191
providence still murmured he   121.58751674388779
the death of m   88.3859811715892
she opened it and seeing that the old man s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns   105.93136726115385
said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color   125.25242432380996
no pity procureur   133.95411162803222
i feel so much pity towards you maximilian that listen to me attentively if i do not cure you in a month to the day to the very hour mark my words morrel i will place loaded pistols before you and a cup of the deadliest italian poison a poison more sure and prompt than that which has killed valentine   54.031660467745446
he was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment   151.69611182046077
you really disturb the conversation   87.78011374037206
but here the wound reopens and the heart again thirsts for vengeance   85.89527749705809
can we account for instinct   136.7287055796078
he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy   30.984409808510804
unfortunately the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange colored hide and his unaccountable gait that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh the appearance of the aforesaid pony at meung which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before by the gate of beaugency produced an unfavorable feeling which extended to his rider   57.4215604869375
you must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the circumstances   81.1650048528707
all this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of september   67.19842375719855
the commission is usually one and a half   135.1808751130591
and then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind i besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life   68.24555669406064
i do not understand you sir said raoul   112.78170346650707
all you were showing me   100.92292760691213
but he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth   137.46035470770065
it is only five minutes past eight said he to morrel   126.96722675637815
well then the frenchman took off his mask   88.67002772377096
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him   174.09584086504063
as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and renée in waiting   22.707261776899117
we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility   77.82147534454802
you requested to see him   104.45606075309782
with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance   115.96698059996646
your sword   109.04242667300574
monte cristo shuddered and arose   119.02653220992691
you are right said she i have often thought of it   115.94338815874075
this sort of attack is very frightful to witness   141.59175138572118
i only beg leave to observe to monsieur that the night will be very cold that chills bring on rheumatism and that a lackey who has the rheumatism makes but a poor servant particularly to a master as active as monsieur   128.9211478537833
i shut my eyes and i can see you as you then were   118.98486814161656
has a young man such as i am gone through this morning then   121.52366440380771
then said aramis in his neighbor s ear the conferences are over   16.348681109718626
has not a fatal chance revealed all this   118.64774671806434
answered d artagnan i believe we must   183.83557645227654
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene   100.3901299774233
then turning towards edmond who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried   68.2767679388122
but i so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me   180.0236152178722
laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time   98.98662848337136
what o clock is it   88.59922968799023
everything considered you are very well off here   99.268340481759
i only regret it because she was a woman   123.31810150011307
add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him   85.7811325097232
a knot of rose colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground   73.17661024897964
he was to wait at the gate   163.13103233314663
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table   151.32544096465438
groslow is the man who broke parry s head and is now getting ready to break ours   117.98312614799606
can i be of any use to you   156.20193008749837
my dear aramis you have the pen of a secretary of state   20.06634905987319
what my maid tells me   148.4403138289186
happy on the contrary for what am i in want of   133.97893045701463
read me her letter   218.36378187037562
cavalcanti his father had been seen in paris and it was expected that he would re appear to claim the illustrious outcast   63.66396284818513
debray to ruin me   93.11646181724694
not at all my good friend   81.38922443476096
speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities interrupted aramis   124.42394336335124
his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze   144.5620444531792
what could be the good of that   79.30365257559993
i shall come back to dessert   74.08541160828287
you shall live and you shall be avenged   126.2582999983621
just heaven what have i read   90.8947152366913
yes replied caderousse   186.3944305785125
full then of this conviction he pulled his cap down over his eyes and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip   109.08329227286033
and you will find traces of poison   117.13282517843537
i can t leave you alone in this abominable country   127.10767567755988
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition   59.27812269634646
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the new comer had proved to be a customs officer   188.78534647912142
the tumult now began to increase   96.76943212301583
when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends   74.60861520898878
choose tyburn madame   28.705727525922327
are you making a sketch after poussin   183.83011458669006
but those of others that is quite another thing   110.63375818866211
you wring my heart   70.94085803956955
he recognized louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men   151.87729058966545
is this corpse come to life already   75.51384261258727
now as d artagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his   80.20156351029462
for the poison which she pours there is no antidote   180.29698636207314
what are you no longer in possession of your senses   119.55125630385504
pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher   180.95712477315908
it would be very easy if you much wished it   120.6423840971543
poison death   82.4926110988884
she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for her   61.167217176500785
sir he said you have made a mistake   43.65110268078732
i am dying   79.13589067105389
upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressing gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar   120.76783539170724
asked the two gendarmes   159.98179165794272
yes and at his age alexander cæsar and napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind him   99.9130290187353
signed abbé busoni   57.45211403635939
it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you can not grudge it to me   193.66744283571032
yes it is i said d artagnan it is i whom god has sent to watch over you   155.1697171652454
but said debray to beauchamp if i spoke to the president you must have been with the procureur   110.56949602640351
we severed our fetters with a file the englishman had given us and swam away   93.05411286804488
oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead   50.22653541139374
did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximilian too rich   139.49674291766092
i am glad they please you   146.01181466108244
but what are you looking for   112.48364845096825
in what   93.3843931264625
this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that i wish to belong to the church and that i avoid all mundane opportunities   110.17391417119937
said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure   125.47880824081851
i will leave him at the place i quit and he will conduct you to me   81.23383054354717
well said porthos i will run to the hôtel and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight o clock   41.36709089920251
i have all my pay to take nearly three months wages   86.68324263428752
the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars   94.20196329051664
i have assassinated then and not executed   100.64977873502667
to day the third will be there also   138.06138854451422
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer   53.727754608631344
and you have learned nothing from any other quarter   131.64970628584345
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs   94.23324470514818
d artagnan held the bridle of athos s horse and porthos that of aramis   66.64098596475176
denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from france within a week afterward   188.55514646376764
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia   188.98818760939162
demanded milady   138.82705250574097
thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province   153.01549468467394
the house at auteuil monte cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner   95.79365354706756
the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves   92.35147523853476
and that applies very well to you   164.63937008093637
this chamber   123.03282655793598
d artagnan drew near the window and lent his ear   147.38486981200464
the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor   91.71243108623511
dantès must be crushed to gratify villefort s ambition   40.74190052111585
yes you may as well take mousqueton   115.69350519763599
tell them to order number 25 to come downstairs   121.47550678436563
50063m ah   81.32459469343098
the heart of the young man overflowed with joy   155.1519530663137
four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table   139.1724018173891
noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse   122.1003146221126
it was nine o clock in the evening   192.61393812973586
the veins of the throat swelled   81.48082955364951
about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwell s cuirassiers   123.52354123071362
asked blaisois sharply is that their true drink   143.86772469071195
but the third time which is the present you may succumb   110.42078722203252
but it was perfidiously stolen from me   215.4100625608737
may i ask what you were doing there   159.47516777485382
when you can find out a woman s age by her face it is useless to ask it   91.01276267696993
chapter 84   101.98652550412415
from the ends of these two wings extended the park   105.43201891364802
escape   198.75607062584118
yes let us go   195.99093634519753
well said beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend   84.82121033785097
there you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers   159.17984334204462
what are we going to do i faith   166.74819292294268
say frankly what do you think of this business   117.13053396398077
so then the wedding is to take place immediately m   195.09112445836809
i knew the horse he rode   50.42519336908194
they ask my name i can not give it since my parents abandoned me   95.45021930857892
porthos s plan appears to me to be impracticable said d artagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you   91.73119335335126
have you read the arabian nights   149.1530003140417
the world however is mistaken   116.29920230475976
but only one of these two is about to die   127.25172643113964
the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha   45.221418248323516
it is to pass the carnival at venice   108.3812751424312
the duke fights against us   103.87445768913813
and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan   130.25075203910737
there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse   144.304468042126
and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered   72.63457559334812
some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him   155.963360050856
do you want a map   122.58767660426207
ay   121.23465911331334
doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions   66.79570221067732
the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame   193.78792643639053
then he closed one eye in token of inquiry   130.5878729610119
that would be a far better life than i lead now   160.1086213085098
if you be not it is a different matter and i warn you in the name of courtesy of which you appear profoundly ignorant that i shall chastise you for your insolence   83.62000510583431
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb   181.16968543631788
cried he in a hoarse voice come here   99.41944035085889
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raoul s departure   130.40032293412662
god gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you   144.96435812308974
they advanced towards a boat which a custom house officer held by a chain near the quay   118.29108855260438
but nothing escaped the count s notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister s secretary   62.637824597701666
she is goddaughter to laporte the confidential valet of the queen   20.003273057648556
every door was opened to him   111.04964574893908
but i am wrong to dispute with my master   127.19239102693041
albert took beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him   102.03497797637873
this vexes you   165.21346788882934
in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30 000 francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person   30.192934874838173
yes yes poor captain leclere   84.3202496544647
all the others remained on the right hand bank where they fell on their knees   173.5672888572831
the following day about three o clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count   105.02086421236501
i can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days that is all to athos whose wound still makes him suffer to go to the waters of forges   96.12416399865005
let me stay here   174.65728897573794
morrel reflected   51.94248928089922
you are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely   68.1001613203687
i won t hold my tongue   83.6904479039923
haydée what an adorable name   123.59295260191047
my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and i played at his feet admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance   190.83278850865838
and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad   137.85385789962373
said d artagnan drawing his pistols from his belt you will kill nobody if you please   86.82184161993854
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere   85.01814296116859
but what is that to me provided i see you again   160.54527146549546
what for philip   141.1203912540125

his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme   80.51861992102121
said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession   126.01923269763286
sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this i feared some accident might happen to them   212.14570815612376
planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters steeds   90.24703107955435
poor woman   62.926275743882464
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me   136.58778212984933
the footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices   98.68646206688386
i can not bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all know poor franz d épinay   155.08975211020768
said porthos turning toward another musketeer   105.94847827939672

i tell you   119.60561797618915
a fleur de lis said athos   109.38867990517069
but not so the lover who was to have married her   46.8264885862303
danglars in the same tone in which he would have said oh well what do i care   34.404655187977625
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force   164.1123036008484
every one according to his nature my dear d artagnan   116.53663502634703
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he can not have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward   130.51808892636552
i would not go at all said aramis   120.12203885240737
you are there sir   98.99224941220517
the king s children next arrived the princess charlotte a beautiful fair haired child with tears in her eyes and the duke of gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride   132.63617103108442
so i think replied d artagnan   92.54087896393412
asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon   133.367979831323
yes let the sermon be clear said the curate   86.84971059489588
the walls are double the thickness of the rest   116.2174216098265
agreeable   148.4118698666992

yes the idea was yours   118.17518550284038
well he will do more than he has promised   116.9482264781941
i thought they might be useful so i took them   149.99795122519106
de tréville knows him and esteems him very highly and de tréville as you know is one of the queen s greatest friends   132.5219586127659
by thieves   83.33096916331212
but perhaps you have never loved   145.3597261153202
he promised well as you see first a runaway then an assassin   67.69793183863172
but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world   147.16520439197197
you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly   118.090121820738
what will happen then   77.68175747744178
well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece   106.96993331385589

what consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you   63.0474491084183
i am not by any means resigned   205.24756474184508
villefort made a violent effort and in a tone he strove to render firm sir said he i am no longer able as i had hoped to restore you immediately to liberty   151.71646509824686
listen sir   139.11128021433933

what mean you by that   155.71945559753613
you know that she is and i demand her liberty of you   113.87577256328551
the footman went out   165.08659370287916
no one must know this secret my dear but yourself   113.82349678294966
it was then striking half past ten by st   94.9846278548718
she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate   106.66505916622455
thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of vincennes are fatal to my family   80.88495306960868
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word   87.26709598538629
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone   83.48727103355287
which treasure i bequeath and leave en   109.9349174127028
caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller   107.09577357496403
my mass   146.4608808132219
there reigned a perfect stillness in the house   72.47734822205459
then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room   104.26609274340248
and on what account   99.54383773941868
athos had been out since six o clock   182.1226469864612
and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris   217.30187804615835
know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this world s affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east   92.09583285774205
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family   114.08129611005806
the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi   111.83402787894866
charles bowed and retired   85.36702090143372
d artagnan opened the letter and read as follows dear d artagnan dear du vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me   179.68186760625537
his paleness terrified athos who however consented himself with saying that s a sad throw comrade   17.67672237180591
was there nothing to fear   114.84957560732936
this evening your destiny begins to change   111.74257672342641
and i replied franz will tell you as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called aladdin   106.65494626741625
de morcerf and that of the whole house he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion   147.7150976327315
i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta   78.7645410305109
from time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets   78.1941107415702

the two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the faubourg but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of paris had become rivers and the open places lakes   120.32849795935813
i received this morning five millions which i paid away   109.25565806734585
and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me   114.05387646235502
he was polite to me and i was so to him   105.01292634662354
and after pressing the hand of athos d artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist   115.86300612611814
you have only escaped from mademoiselle danglars piano to be attacked by haydée s guzla   177.95978929723307

the valet left the room   139.99950183702637
the count was of the highest nobility   24.43377048444418
he had only found the first grotto   75.97888976218582
and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man s shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size   63.20190666349597
the second time it was to demand who had sullied my name   168.98674971489052
all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal   82.99131270448106
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the ante chamber where d artagnan was waiting   124.5608313075976
wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out   123.2514275454972

overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight   111.11585768940644
blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor   199.9643288165312
the flag stone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto   220.9038859745414

the whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world   114.8511858776864
my own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and scotland   148.23000055274815

the rumor of edmond s arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city   207.8772730306062

morrel bounded to the door opened it and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs   70.79932547717945

is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden   218.10064422536811
albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered   167.48498330544976

then everything was still excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied   100.54568291039092
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket   136.33926110044675
this paper my friend said faria i may now avow to you since i have the proof of your fidelity this paper is my treasure of which from this day forth one half belongs to you   153.80414494931685
no sir i assure you muttered raoul it is not   135.3873903303029
and now gentlemen that s well continued the cardinal   73.98582473674132
after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read   99.88387096911492
a terrible inclination seized d artagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him   100.3260952569991
at the outer door the steward paused   80.52916329887988
will it last long   99.65305738519834
and you have no way to get news of them   93.90505592460805
said he she is asleep   78.84874926088149
she exclaimed let him come in   152.73217200984726
good and beautiful as you are   149.2673382757816
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own   140.32532963318997
eugénie danglars said monte cristo   87.70271585322064
be silent you simpleton   165.70027087580524
yes for his eminence will give you all that you want land money and titles   109.75912331865705
ah sir you have a noble heart   89.15869989978684
broussel then proceeded to his wife s room and asked for breakfast   87.72246227892774
i was trying on my wedding suit   33.05097323196577
one two three four five said monte cristo   45.6018685063831
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty   56.41849579719799
back people   64.29198583035901
the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abbé busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nîmes   67.0710062022113
it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all 900 000 francs are worth regretting   46.874724291530995
and where do the servants sleep   55.34497845711867
there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep   33.97825285404362
but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he   136.3927834889999
but we are no longer in the city sir said she   168.7129102873753
raoul had offered some opposition at first   116.42159526476017
what were you doing in the battle my friend   55.83309806132604
the very same   180.8613745885335
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her   83.73154917570079
50085m m   123.97539511694487
change these lackeys said he   140.59546278447294
he beat a retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his halberdiers   116.66456549413081
yes replied the man but at what a price   119.9252897963754
monsieur de morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made   167.14832635851286
villefort s dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of m   84.46751697802779
you have been to london   144.587875353882
but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger s   176.71647819983633
thy master was in the wrong   173.76197630705877
the young man directed him   139.6391529698342
and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed   148.39262762148363
you are right said milady   136.6624279833046
it was the island of tiboulen   166.15561896956322
to be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power   54.61693420234928
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queen oh my lord   160.50806715278452
the first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the baron danglars rue de la chaussée d antin no   70.34864145837693
they explained what had occurred that evening   134.8285083958647
cried de blacas   66.31986062344825
haydée had remained until the close of the meeting   153.11250394409095
any why not this evening   119.69361260056472
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with   32.85013986339271
vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before   105.11625509673503
she stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen why then do you always weep mother when i am away from you   170.03544763800613
he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear   129.84201375710614
it is not worthwhile   83.53014478104032
he fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed   172.030919140524
but what shall i wear   129.547021644967
at beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for porthos   130.27038985853062
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly   173.5269583660149
it is not very difficult to say   113.17545600755892
these two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed   180.71718229649088
meanwhile m   141.5072920717379
very well let us go said caderousse   91.43685752971437
my wife adores me and there is yet time   166.63350916595655
full of this idea villefort s face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also   45.89606616415493
you know very well the wine from the hills of anjou   102.70812224103274
the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter   80.52056102583859
but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife   28.700176841549037
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start   117.51594671444114
and you forget one thing   150.34983222061737
keep your money keep it i say   125.07686365604202
you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek   149.9797634409026
i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself   127.49881034885625
i was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east   188.83895504805744
that is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white   156.79440059173976
i am in his majesty s guards monseigneur and i have no reason to be dissatisfied   75.29787554278157
you are right sir said athos   132.94120023380438
i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure   105.83462875406988
he has slain his uncle   97.48017155862695
an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury   49.88682386633582
make your mind easy he is in good hands   89.70239322732478
edward ran out   113.76865563848834
yes almost said aramis   177.68938350028984
d artagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety   67.39019180638337
but his name   155.48655673656225
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard   64.72175976879453
she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon d artagnan when he spared the life of her brother   151.71237928827324
the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch   92.20300568698238
but the particulars are still unknown to me   177.91079878480502
but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of d artagnan who is a faithful friend whom i love and defend or i swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit or shall have committed shall be the last   48.050076182840044
replied the count frowning   164.28767132966843
at length athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to d artagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to speak   114.87121933272317
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos   129.0536861427472
haydée dried her eyes and continued by this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pasha it was a friend   92.97650685297869
in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy   160.66985264434484
asked the queen for i hear them   51.77792893483421
well i will go to england a second time   144.75468437482328
yes indeed count said madame danglars   85.2141830658292
cried d artagnan again he forever he   184.2630797535731
were you a party man   139.45029688095084
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd   82.42731471895507
the horses will have a long night s rest and at five o clock to morrow morning we can be again on the road   136.07491452201347
said morrel you dead   141.70371734452158
when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys   188.77863356960236
well let us set out   78.83413996096351
quick as a flash he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair   158.62899595085662
well then i decide   114.84941259622963
a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you   98.0310920060611
is it your father   175.67180636588395
the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work   127.69310897381654
then he stepped into his coupé calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes   90.56915251594263
then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle m   67.52106948773553
a woman   116.95482426051593
for i had forgotten him said the lieutenant   87.29065044387298
valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred   180.2672841781798
the count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon morrel upon the first occasion   95.05417691010602
ma foi i should like to smoke   157.64765655716414
also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo on whom i give you a draft of 48 000 francs   125.96696786497941
i neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me constance disappeared   147.3500692819929
as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window   119.96521051350446
d artagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive   106.23145315932626
what is it that we really desire   71.9544907462562
alas i guess it   148.55260295491146
my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but misfortune   79.4688052402729
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack   96.3378184869791
traitorous monsieur   55.24187721126914
holloa monsieur d artagnan   164.0402312176738
i will do mine elsewhere   162.89189618763191
i will be accountable for her said athos   153.61261744428558
and with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day d artagnan directed his course toward m   157.19116024915076
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him   54.97775871653119
exclaimed madame de villefort   91.3987595087907
but you are rich valentine   103.42567756420962
so once more good night   80.26526392767376
ali left the room   93.24611933471411
he thought the carriage was about to stop there   202.50526374502002
did he name no one in his passion   96.4161826603053
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin   117.83558068568588
then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received   122.33183752344112
it is hashish the purest and most unadulterated hashish of alexandria the hashish of abou gor the celebrated maker the only man the man to whom there should be built a palace inscribed with these words a grateful world to the dealer in happiness   141.52540799290873
remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your master s head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for you   86.37893205873931
resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day d artagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast   95.56181448484185
said he to ali who came immediately take that to my solicitor   65.5027551822335
as to mme   74.97054115030124
commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work   115.42593814657607
he the support the liberator the father of the people   141.06648698349414
they had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the guards   203.76931081666436
it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury   73.1256323403349
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms   73.00546754414671
he desired me to tell your grace replied felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle   127.38177246311649
yes he has entered   76.2247363935656
de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans   135.7726784541966
what lord ruthven do you mean   176.89994877688457
you need not fear   132.6699593376335
in the name of heaven madame said villefort where is the doctor   42.7679429612288
de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies   147.97399008459684
upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company   72.08495586179995
the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment   103.05972649836873
your pardon replied danglars i merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time   86.22330131807875
this began to be annoying   90.57089414945953
was she dead   173.72492591002054
well then sire continued d artagnan listen to the noise of the people   153.47218965753143
if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward   105.67271743468565
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz   99.8084088900468
at bracieux alone i have twenty thousand francs in gold   162.57928935930587
we are consequently not friends   116.3020959767812
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers   44.19595419356884
the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards d artagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris   97.97323465673098
come said caderousse wiping his large knife on his apron if i did not like you do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead me   92.6343799654907
and she is one of the greatest in her country too   77.00633158490825
they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey   121.57762068576736
sir i obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to depart   70.7761437998447
athos replied the musketeer   69.47673410874232
monsieur porthos   161.78485678165035
fortunately you won t be laid up more than a fortnight   108.36324534103917
i shall go and shoot on his estate   110.25468925553456
am i to put this construction on your visit   31.426978564890007
fear that relentless pursuer clogged dantès efforts   95.45050960798736
no i do not hesitate   39.7441697236881
oh you beautiful good little creature   189.4051797709356
where then sir   103.57043755552468
and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honoré   144.43061953081278
danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor   226.54674523208024
d artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau   107.97136716804717
well said she you see he refuses   158.64865797731056
that is to say i am in the king s service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to england i solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms   104.15024816950138
embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend athos   54.636208487649135
but d artagnan again shook his head   95.03164498185207
lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds   50.939828825263334
at this moment winter s voice was raised with the cry of forward   120.62387727478037
just now   97.30781867766504
he has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition   138.24406620941284
let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion   66.76969066055534
explain my child he said explain my child he said explain where did you find this purse   81.9183899627393
monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood   132.07788296245442
when that is over you sir can return to paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her mother in law   97.12748903636091
oh mine replied d artagnan was not a man   57.97419854230792
important and urgent said he   94.59212844314294
no not if i can use more activity than my enemies   72.72299879768875
the young man s words sounded to him like metal and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis   62.34724089069143
formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request   171.70202706461697
sir monk said de guiche confess well that brave man   165.3454256681821
we will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united   171.50358524396609
how is that my friend   145.5142775254912
think for a moment   122.27362886185199
danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed   164.10103314586684
but the light of the torch revealed their true worth   107.6543248443705
villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters   99.40223469008444
we must go replied villefort offering his arm   192.0580258066263
nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still   124.19266929541588
night came and at ten o clock they anchored   144.04365480272756
do you suppose i carry 100 000 francs in my pocket   93.11825760772888
life for life man for man   133.11873243488165

nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own   99.32926758960184
he had a heavy hand dear old athos after drinking   119.83939448578928
i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days   104.00363719432887
buckingham in paris   126.64551082494422
a shudder passed over him   212.12685835743048
well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman   144.20182421706733
his secret then was in the past as had often been vaguely said to d artagnan   54.00447441138796
he was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line   234.42506052265185
but at last the lieutenant s horse refused to go on   144.66491503709346
you are certainly going mad   115.8784760994048
monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare   104.83943756892955
but this time the affair is serious for here is a lady compromised by you   173.00617283254527
the queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protruded   65.8603708714042
it was very hard   177.3242596894417
in royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all   118.02701913004873
i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m   144.93872434118487
with the hundred pistoles we can live well to the end of the month   62.39278948560627
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path   132.82670707911214
the king made vitry marechal of france for an assassination while i have left in obscurity in poverty the noble d artagnan who saved me   179.84666214165009
and i will pay you or i shall be dead   89.59723844656536
i shall find many men as able as you are   164.83280564811514
president i can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lieutenant general the count of morcerf in epirus and in macedonia with important particulars   106.95224891974952
cried he throwing himself on his horse   92.05425973843722
asked d artagnan seeing that mme   160.02210269457498
my lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest castilian   108.90234941554986
she murmured   67.95974647221271
oh she did love me   48.79364667429297
her legs failed her and she sank into an armchair   155.43181428246254
his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majesty s window the cry we heard was his and there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol   100.62226183379381
but you did not come   119.9078521462215
i don t say exactly answered the gascon confused   106.6034915237432
when shall you send your invitations   55.85476971297347
the three young men bowed to each other courteously if not affably   222.37083011074088
we sent you wine   133.07933821202064
and has the unfortunate man wife or children   108.90693671167966
great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand   99.01052439168855
you do not know these ultramontane millionaires   68.02983358515951
the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be difficult   138.78189837523232
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire   121.42179024315116
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried   90.55483795076663
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning   3.5162827619949724
they were only fit for a young man   95.60217024418085
over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a full length portrait of anne of austria so perfect in its resemblance that d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it   79.26754785165087
he calls that being as poor as job   90.63255271511761
asked a porter advancing to the new arrival   95.51452624718907
do not fear   203.75200265279682
proceed she said   130.57884824985123
it is for you replied a gendarme   123.42062616756216
a loud cry could be heard by her   39.94265241618275
monte cristo and haydée took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without sugar   102.89242139805481
i guess what brings you here   39.064086451939474
stand here don t stir turn your back to the road and wait for me   154.0565315482911
did you see all that   137.8312320966875
i have blessed you and you are sacred to me   128.05632477629638
there remains then three hundred and fifty   125.64359841583592
the palace of the louvre contains two things the king who must die and royalty which never dies   133.1686443210574
repeated the baroness   82.09226647448807
scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation   67.72857233689044
that reply led to several questions about the king s capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely   108.99681419569202
but i m afraid entre nous that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him   110.05093452124214
you said you could give me advice what is it   157.69317355002792
50201m maximilian said the count without appearing to notice the different impressions which his presence produced on the little circle i come to seek you   123.00072120912807
adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him   53.915635554846126
they entered the bedroom   142.00274651903868
to call edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre   106.42133240750428
on the contrary replied aramis your opinion will be very valuable   137.79291469298118
mazarin bit his lips   137.54054706471004
de chevreuse had been in paris but still further that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a cabal   72.51299375871017
héloïse   91.41975181514614
he had taken revenge on mazarin and had aided in his father s deliverance from prison   102.95516118711367
he repaired then instantly to the office of the lieutenant criminel   197.97304074176822
i don t know my way   121.37524862630077
gaspard gaspard   67.11299868596879
but it is one of the principal military appointments in the king s household   106.98269978573532
other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers   158.73273705067595
are you wounded   185.1775959265072
d artagnan had not been deceived   33.33480791405721
a scar on his temple   160.60643912300398
after ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened   98.75559216307757
at a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as dantès knew in the frioul and outside the inner harbor   154.93162797962407
then the cardinal will be pleased with me   56.58575803212568
now on taking prisoners this morning two frenchmen who seemed to me of high birth in short two knights of the garter i said to myself my fortune is made   146.27624544218617
again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate saying as she did so and why do you come so late today   93.2477531931833
does not his appearance speak for him   162.03911224429262
your honors said he that woman had a child   122.33993394592352
the wall had closed again   171.0329321948361
40284m your daughter   191.33672348859997
this would have been a method of reckoning time had not dantès long ceased to do so   134.014153044309
nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice   121.9160749669858
well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well   74.75657658426329
but formerly it appears began mousqueton timidly   194.68680322526785
here goes the barony   156.3206226168945
you wish to make me believe something too dreadful   93.64894109899495
one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows   82.46053718163785
the two friends looked at each other   133.85765969515572
so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction   68.87482764241162
continued mme   87.18146816686307
you have conspired with your wife with madame de chevreuse and with my lord duke of buckingham   118.3141238914849
exclaimed debray   82.33975813337284
and albert took out of a little pocket book with golden clasps a remnant of his old fancies or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door albert took out of this pocket book a note of 1 000 francs   116.40168034285512
for i begin to suffer again   137.28720016975115
c est bien prouvé par le déluge   130.9550340094682
felton would see all   166.7679950938544
said porthos astonished at his friend s deception   89.32174696180715
does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england   40.773728594699804
ah your honor how can you say so   118.88047824808706
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the wax light always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment   67.25539033366289
yes monsieur said planchet and i will go as soon as you please   43.0813445905913
de villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed   138.37174960639783
cried m   73.96809140654643
and he fell back on the bed   99.81352886803337
de tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except d artagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place   108.07918964391652
why if you ever make use of the details i am about to give you that you will never let anyone know that it was i who supplied them   97.07552465327066
whither are you going count   173.08407203244445
he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment   116.36753971613909
by the bonapartists   162.79499501265622
the others withdrew   134.84400203736797
you are right said monte cristo   83.05537168014378
said the gendarmes thrusting dantès forward   160.64889705255598
in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him   59.37414529463138
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said d artagnan if you persist in offering him a civility   159.97995874825781
but they are only civilians very bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me   70.90030798981009
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers   132.44061137684054
villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence   6.386971804793731
the dogs became in their turn silent   41.28318420928963
the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine   72.84550288265584
i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m   120.75109928855431
and d artagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred   197.87459392432345
i introduce no one and certainly not m   60.308559347250096
yes but the son has done us no harm   95.00520923696504
the vessel was in as good condition as i am and as i hope you are m   161.28434579177855
good very good said porthos   88.5953836958495
inquired caderousse half bewildered with joy   121.29287812994869
de morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina   205.81095813425122
i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much   111.9463224383135
the cabinet of m   135.88341921711714
pardon me monsieur but you are not my lord the duke of buckingham said mme   115.14927932622155
the dark space frightened her   163.3038199165691
said my enemy in a jeering tone that s quite another thing   121.92586520189593
willingly answered the stranger   100.35211203671497
he was thought to be dead   162.62929289155204
then he sent his card to signor pastrini and asked for albert de morcerf   148.4375955266543
there is nothing more easy said mousqueton with a modest air   118.01183249366098
aramis assumed that perilous charge   195.40557142301765
let him come in then   123.08962229505875
a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand   91.66604974859553
after the execution   81.74659067858246
because you shrug your shoulders   78.19617437994692
bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer   176.19392268085554
i should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition   96.82199965453475
and albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows a correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance   208.25237729415363
help me gentlemen cried d artagnan we must break in this door   114.568176266899
as for what you do me the honor to say i presume you mean i was afraid   66.56409577719367
the master   26.784645528440805
remember raoul this   102.59036251623299
when he was completely dressed he said send hither monsieur d artagnan   155.42163075388305
no i slept as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when i am hungry without feeling inclined to eat   82.69069017087152
who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death   112.60955907644667
he has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to paris before   95.71026276967166
when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said it appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone   117.69321901364597
caderousse was filled with wonder   140.03260053116088
resumed mazarin with his artful smile   64.62756972353485
whose is the sand upon which we were reclining   87.29043086893867
do you know them fernand   139.72645374721088
milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a chicken   80.62974869201254
the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and i ask no more for my husband than has been done for me   92.96459694071892
placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand   130.77234795375594
and who is beppo   68.58077115353194
well a day   84.4914890979907
d artagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her feet   199.89110101844787
dantès reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge   167.38895175500542
sure of being killed by athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos   72.69821240014832
andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count   92.9780834088444
no count   107.28264814356652
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed   83.76355264686758
yes continued the queen i think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and i wish to know your name   123.98954238388357
the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base   128.8898688889942
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty   85.57101379997911
so that on returning home d artagnan found the reunion complete   151.746876294689
at the same time continued d artagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey   127.03394492331562
listen friend said monte cristo   209.2855632898512
by demanding my head of the cardinal   36.53632361236407
inactive my dear fellow   63.002692714145795
without that what would become of me   135.01434006708544
here i am sir   83.01338525496259
the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety   87.15954599603465
she is called milady but she may be french   120.9560433574053
well la ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that i shall try them   129.8993190576054
he began to reflect upon the events that had passed   154.05953289081123
de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence   151.9785618263161
gone   111.39251356707928
the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose trees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season   64.04365947170004
i would say that i know this great lady   150.65399054330948
let us go back to our places   180.3971005396375
i thought he had seen me at work   113.90919309066864
the duke undid his belt and gave it to grimaud who tied la ramee in such a way as to satisfy him   50.935681052678945
he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five millions   75.0562370605821
alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one another   158.46987371283623
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach   156.88623037163703
he will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to take   133.98967525167666
the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself   154.02931674866437
20064m and with a smile expressive of supreme content he left his hiding place and without being observed descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation and hailing three times shouted jacopo jacopo jacopo   122.36463891359935
and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion   162.84907658846404
to you my preserver perhaps   149.8459344396467
be careful valentine said morrel hesitating to comply with the young girl s wishes   136.44160838169276
well then porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and i how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns   76.86950355696777
and you baron pursued the count addressing franz do you also depart tomorrow   180.79913307711948
no one will come said she   150.64545710790236
yes christian and surname are the same   16.307977219221044
said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness   42.74623250415718
but he had gone too far to draw back   103.82967055185034
not only him but some of his friends messieurs porthos and aramis   156.56827856364745
if she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there   146.37873546733906
and do you undertake to reform it   78.94794000552875
you have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel   93.34139803041235
you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion   83.64882690507648
at five o clock albert returned delighted with his day s work   112.87304351933584
thought porthos the man aramis wants me to strangle   120.67109239471031
and you you d artagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of france bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagoners   201.22092866467443
cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with joy saved you are saved   146.6026162022197
as a further precaution they had bound his hands   109.12686451246557
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors   39.0456209658424
my letter is private and confidential and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels   93.55189913530896
dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters   53.85690007578108
if i am free why these bars and these doors   145.75595582670664
but as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind   52.97252859549083
do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine   71.87051307622039
he sent them two excellent horses and the fugitives went out hastily from tours shaping their course toward spain trembling at the least noise following unfrequented roads and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn   149.88721678052013
for what you have just said   84.59665844846785
i warn you however his services will cost you something   60.35695181865537
then i need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you   165.1818856337926
debray is with madame   119.71401838390334
and does the husband of this frightful creature still live   102.29402738811457
a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself   15.252581694024386
we will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said d artagnan and share the three hundred   76.33993970792784
one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding   116.51904236904642
d artagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past eight   154.640480849522
but the voice was all   157.9748152509694
both were addressed to king charles   115.72300840820017
i fear we arrived too late   113.0507949758982
it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me   94.53449526407107
mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing   157.01892988912334
oh my mother   132.72138454983596
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it   114.72227841057807
it is a veritable army   184.187111205532
then said danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal love then mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin   82.97432561166868
but that proves that all is not yet over   62.44980149186419
you have a sad air   90.5594419414556
and then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman   160.1310355264668
obey said noirtier s intelligent eye   105.21133769249447
villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man   9.530066402210934
but what has happened then since last evening count   135.93676160095623
adieu your holiness said the mendicant opening the door and bending low before the prelate   225.42151293286867
all is well i thank you   83.86391951324006
ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels   110.32193548748963
you think he is tracked pursued captured   101.56326429308943
i accept it said she   71.89680997613961
at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping   119.473975854573
but contentment is so new a sight to me that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband   140.06916313189836
julie and emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you   151.82609840124405
but where the devil were you gadding last night my young master   92.38953741153131
to present our respects to the cardinal   114.20374327815696
aramis answered d artagnan who did not wish to undeceive porthos aramis fancy has become a monk and a jesuit and lives like a bear   104.17927205782004
that is the most direct line to london   219.82797222374242
that would have been another motive for sympathy between us   152.8654540318022
yes replied m   138.59191853818544
then taking out his watch he added it is half past eleven   113.50082754106307
you jest i presume   48.18999757742594
since his first arrival at paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and great   163.59022503943518
i know myself father   53.08947865546835
forsooth i don t know   168.6759464317319
buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature   107.43409679917127
at length you are mine   134.77099270134693
and paris   182.17092901028371
and rushing towards the door she opened it saying here edmond here i am   118.10414725587364
if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself   105.89723273477149
come let us see what you will do for me   82.29786582469798
stop a minute ah this is it timeo danaos et dona ferentes which means beware of the enemy who makes you presents   146.3266773824301
branded in the eyes of the world you invoke try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor mad   96.64392799852591
50249m danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him   110.62758335182916
emmanuel go with them and see that my orders are executed   94.63183934057977
with difficulty but he can speak   133.92551433257628
to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife   95.53108556373
or at least that i had had no hand in it   152.238241335676
it was the most simple thing in the world   129.74575397799623
she intoxicated   156.14236462910426
one with a letter and the other put it in the post   158.45686060192963
she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop   107.02454321477018
and he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors   220.46636085022197
a deathlike silence oppressed all nature   88.36998314349898
the proofs   89.77389048163533
and the stranger muttering to himself directed his steps toward the kitchen   119.7519832613319
twas not your right place i think as you were not equipped for an engagement   109.8896639119082
the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of opulence   71.69092670879306
for unlike porthos who accompanied the variations of chance with songs or oaths athos when he won remained as unmoved as when he lost   43.640403080547415
you met a monk did you not   73.46640343833516
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard   157.63904868544336
unquestionably   106.9563650244709
monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abbé faria born at rome   200.368386881266
or an ex emperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from france which is his kingdom by violence and treason   110.19338588173056
well don t be inactive   132.3287021224586
a strasbourg pie   114.58978064547664
this execution quieted the ill disposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hunger this death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation   155.26778076489495
after so many years of painful separation said andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again   219.28868397091827
this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is i assure you a most agreeable surprise   56.45394220893396
that is to say athos porthos and aramis   147.61837771007202
their toilet finished they descended   115.39239071709227
only ten days after the flight of her daughter and three days from the bankruptcy of her husband   13.7399519924695
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence   129.53757305390548
the young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the pont neuf opposite the samaritaine   117.27205043233262
wherefore sir   84.65285290291703
if you know this how much must you suffer   97.48946361440481
monte cristo took the gong and struck it once   128.26219588894486
on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest   146.21222097429992
cried d artagnan in his stentorian voice   126.92800890226852
that will not prevent me replied d artagnan if ever i find him   192.558733006429
the count s well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice   174.23839252135048
wretch cried d artagnan speak quickly   56.32502616732494
as for me it made me tremble   70.48345062350165
but take no notice   61.44127414132922
to the king   52.8049301711334
mordaunt hesitated   114.77782262607336
arrested at compiegne they have been carried to rueil   139.00230578747926
some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse   77.6170410370892
and a pair of oxen   132.49356788840427
he said to the sergeant i believe you are impudent to me   91.56789079727842
may it not be about that cursed affair   145.8313430966698
for i now recollect you   112.38393105182872
he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle   163.5012716536719
and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies   119.58336040840682
at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile   83.02488567954609
namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past   115.39726967664157
50169m what i do not wish madame is that you should perish on the scaffold   134.85275061102703
tis true replied d artagnan   145.0644481574436
it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable   136.90803960701243
oh monsieur   167.1680925481079
a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m   122.00241816500223
i made some curious observations on this at charenton   75.84797080710699
as to dantès he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it   93.98468624061046
but when the time came to pay for his rosemary this oil and the wine the only expense the master had incurred as he had preserved a strict abstinence while on the contrary the yellow horse by the account of the hostler at least had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done d artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained   168.72884129529348
but let us be quick the king may change his mind in an hour   80.96244318339623
then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old   112.15585739378363
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary   72.64269411197019
well he asked that will do will it not   221.29776692758972
she stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of maximilian   91.20203890613548
the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste   119.31244725074929
you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion   144.5044147934933
i have never seen her   106.08717625682354
he knew none himself   72.19498430858164
the commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness   98.08488771947475
madame said he you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor who will communicate certain matters to you with which i have charged him   178.05534116017375
put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord   60.789930287222276
morrel left on old dantès chimney piece and which you tell me is still in your hands   40.574964403945856
around the schooner lay a number of small fishing boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen   141.0790440231721
bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes   83.47935666489369
you have promised to be secret my good monsieur   78.90802931521489
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very peasant   102.11658069951355
father and son chapter 13   47.66603088856152
the king advanced toward madame the president with whom he was to dance and his highness monsieur with the queen   120.60380718494301
if you would permit me said d artagnan with timidity   96.9453096077775
asked madeleine   144.9028932491305
thought d artagnan she is charged with some message for me from her mistress   151.82786177618766
and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles   145.91712396164323
to dantès if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us   75.51949358938434
you look dull   169.21520346030627
her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance   145.4132256871713
admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed   220.0037766787903
and will that be the first time you ever took that journey   51.50590122746278
five minutes after the door had been closed on morrel s entrance it was again opened for the count   199.8642883936824
oh said morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side   127.07476250155261
ah to be sure cried porthos there is a diamond   197.869503829706
you have some plan then   55.55260390676434
she worries me everywhere said d artagnan   84.58238102264599
then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and i should have news from those without the prison walls   118.16507700899653
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria   68.97532896172075
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus   39.70233820647219
another attack of giddiness said morrel clasping his hands   187.39269004049635
stammered caderousse   166.93116749962087
said lord de winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy   64.77518959417603
if he is here this is what the other man said let s see decidedly what to do with him   149.14348543877583
then my dear sir   41.513628264863996
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project   126.98383207080968
i had only to cry out help   60.40960186291104
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence   163.17393818115
you have no money coming in on which you can rely   43.30682220815925
the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly twenty paces from him   161.6368485878112
ah comte de la fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent   106.77137203380428
everything was in order laces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the keys   145.68011823385459
it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman   122.98122364927295
and one for aramis   23.23330222131146
at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside   120.97687307985302
some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the musketeers that the burial would take place at midday   97.15272812827264
but this woman is a friend of aramis i know nothing of that   107.28168917018081
especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age   92.45891739720909
i loved madame bonacieux with my heart while i only love milady with my head said he   73.31657065620367
whilst porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard   108.50644130093131
because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor   153.27557678494665
madame danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every detail   134.6486142469105
but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror   138.8646851914518
no madame no   80.3977006276969
i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it   141.3898232424636
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud   184.7754199850997
albert led his guest into the salon   133.02963155285792
it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have forgotten   104.786662163691
on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the parisian troops ran to him   123.49401767585582
we must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant manner   135.54478720889603
my gratitude is already due   68.0043046630199
and then the queen   168.24402377313362
that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself   8.925485746414665
as they returned toward the castle d artagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has not   153.7240121764546
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again   120.43255908386124
said beauchamp mildly   195.48796081743424
oh valentine you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answer soon   59.22985129240686
but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors   90.73950036855906
he then began to ascend the path   53.94041182246268
and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of st   93.18216002288705
to horse then gentlemen   136.9829440293677
this being understood let us proceed with our history   70.44386522048416
it is my lord i have not named her   127.05314467349577
scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber   146.48423708174118
for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty   102.06605528405824
how sprightly you are said caderousse   157.74759582970808
there came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the heart   146.14440476645464
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force   134.32650723353953
it is over aramis had said   90.86678788026435
adieu abbé said the coadjutor i am to preach to morrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening   83.82166706895507
not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden   71.96313642024614
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions   60.700675721950695
d artagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate   141.0141762849226
do you want any money   112.11161980180766
bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days   38.00144527369196
put to catherine de medici after the massacre of saint bartholomew how have i played my little part   110.00603793612083
during the first act the countess g entered   59.23882525450425
and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance   213.0555773115931
i like the means well enough said d artagnan but where and how to meet with her   160.35068496145277
in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections   179.9707969224193
do you understand the meaning of my words   137.96222215146526
emmanuel returned my sister the house of morrel can only be carried on by a morrel   144.0235642937289
i really believe you are a man and a violent one too   116.61699359958041
it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door   94.88097200663694
oh i am free then i am saved   236.84249863985013
you are joking yourself now   105.19341608027152
said porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army   86.6151126010243
almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment   101.15515747905
come said athos here s another good servant   173.28541798962806
i am already upon the scent resumed d artagnan   89.4518446607288
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day   154.9439589924649
all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf   137.96071912828694
that instant the arm of porthos fell   96.45726399931517
and were you my son or my brother i would refuse you in the same way   15.408811437840399
all this is very strange   2.624645782146743
something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible   189.42345945038062
but whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient self command not to enter   138.49326492802166
said d artagnan there is some truth in what you say   72.46490335565048
speak my child speak said d artagnan   146.65916217239447
as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience   181.99988427840827
yes said monte cristo   104.92173030142172
d artagnan then related all the mad passion of milady and her menaces of death   31.188914092461204
come tell me what can i do for you   109.15413244524227
you first mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat   94.65540431381585
stay here if you like but i warn you twill be rather too warm presently   88.58081731975636
de villefort has just confirmed   106.94013032208545
chapter 77   95.87101643929546
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies   125.42188724207196
and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price   192.60898780947974
nobody   235.9015251173116
now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon   99.52558776227642
morrel s salon   168.662894625893
but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was   131.06744428639828
and from fromelles she had set out for armentières   164.98741743373614
two minutes a man makes four minutes   182.38024768476873
never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself   74.6421334801475
exclaimed m   141.20094401697705
morrel looked attentively on villefort   68.90885401172196
the youth s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face   167.15843664312797
he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground   127.74947635118234
now the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarter day payment and scarron as usual had sent his servant to get his money at the pension office but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give monsieur scarron   120.51538492976196
i take it said m   128.3073855773648
he was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and i heard the phrase very often as rich as a spada   77.74235295204664
and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois of which i send you now the key   42.57235578428788
the heroine of the bouquet kept her word   158.7874514760877
after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage   164.95115789580615
attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation   68.20719127195545
half a million is it   142.54966580463037
none i swear to you   134.34094267867604
milady looked at her lover in silence   167.33357767007894
and does he ever expect to be happy   111.87458307393263
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped   129.65742803225316
he looked at d artagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive them   153.3849996585346
mercédès is not yet your wife   123.6132249083263
enough i think to fulfill your highness s wishes on this occasion   113.61927187837806
whom do you expect to find with me at this hour   80.88478854213488
enough viscount   135.5006039094419
d artagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to him   32.78244631520096
the bare idea would kill me would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my finger nails   216.48029951794626
we may go then   162.9583024901466
precept something but example more   100.39840867929433
but i must not forget one grand point   198.16806071457898
you re right   115.97489066421943
raoul handed the letter to the prince   93.22080222387454
what is he going to do   149.5549963505908
a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father s honor   51.78283424886943
yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cæsar spada   150.3046776436287
little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day   150.79088732279843
bonacieux and if she was returning to paris why this fugitive rendezvous why this simple exchange of a glance why this lost kiss   78.58322091589244
but then philosopher that you are said d artagnan instruct me support me   146.2466908686322
i remembered him well   31.849412107646316
and your excellency wants something to eat   116.4746087756491
20139m under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance   137.92051258293077
no matter this was a greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor   71.20032546368498
some nabob from india was his comment   72.65856286724025
therefore tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 5 050 000 francs he stretched himself on his bed and after turning over two or three times fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying   41.509573101288
in fact about four o clock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance   152.78340673063371
mark   26.289529306306207
go but to portsmouth or southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this amusement   168.1442082674799
a presentation   75.37675170310223
d artagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast   55.25938288979998
three is just my number   73.65050788452825
but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our minds   157.25518201342152
the three men brought the carriage up quietly and took out of it a little man stout short elderly and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color who ascended the ladder very carefully looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion came down as quietly as he had gone up and whispered it is she   135.2107922873483
you have it already for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet   110.85808132829558
whose then is the air we breathe   153.05429073359699
said monte cristo taking the young man s hand affectionately in his   124.79901065089635
i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches   125.76461421759718
but what are we going to do there   149.7958610139687
and at these words as if all her strength was exhausted milady sank weak and languishing into the arms of the young officer who intoxicated with love anger and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown received her with transport pressed her against his heart all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom   93.95511882140302
the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains   150.41529507777565
has the corsican ogre broken loose   97.85725617230689
you see mercédès said the young man here is easter come round again   67.3798670625697
locked   47.1809735110655
shall it be read or shall it be passed over   80.90699435810261
the cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits   122.61403732192228
morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake   267.43947063623335
oh don t be afraid sir replied aramis   76.38499365187016
said the delighted bertuccio and you will find gloves in it   106.79606254273699
the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered will be questioned   27.830111122491246
his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts   104.06158351804449
i do not know said mercédès   37.02433935069203
no take it away   93.0922603624096
now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations   82.33796572510916
no i can trust nobody   107.22769457021421
that said athos would be quite another thing   222.1241540749868
i am of a frankness of character quite french   202.83919767055002
ali appeared   116.16767985789924
with three fingers to be sure one for the father one for the son and one for the holy ghost   142.37546355964074
i have nothing to give you my son but fifteen crowns my horse and the counsels you have just heard   94.91228628128462
but hold should such a misfortune happen well athos passed his hand across his pale brow   140.11620688011143
quite rested sir   63.97494170527824
often in prison faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive dantès you must not give way to this listlessness   115.08156424359821
this path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty   99.07029362702035
cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of spain and austria began to rise   125.11285768368516
i only ask you one favor   102.18962822442924
while waiting his assistance i trust to your word   136.04577623665165
he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine 29 with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercédès seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly   152.68681648082173
to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent   61.73530635622316
as for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite   118.32143654644861
look at that wall without a single window which tells you fine things about mazarin s gratitude   137.62907588978982
tis raoul who has come back said athos   119.150340039123
and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions   152.34214335658876
go and bow to her   147.12147096648113
there continued athos either peace or war will be decided   86.0107997849062
it is my dear valentine said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering   67.71938413424016
he is not so much of a devil as he appears   126.927514919069
for it is getting late   32.34027144633096
the duke put his pen to the paper   88.33834798512572
sir you are tempting me   96.98418569493975
mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance   78.36262496386935
i would rather have had a hat said d artagnan   95.73275007285919
now then she said what next   74.27399919388137
on one of those immense staircases upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house ascended and descended the office seekers of paris who ran after any sort of favor gentlemen from the provinces anxious to be enrolled and servants in all sorts of liveries bringing and carrying messages between their masters and m   143.71256955374986
this is a council of state d artagnan remarked to porthos   169.3788374004868
what did you say sir   130.28586692057968
these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king   145.82988887454405
yes said the old man s look with eagerness   182.7635577279048
where is providence   150.185204591912
and that is why m   121.50018423279249
i want you to be approved   72.40920095412558
caderousse then looked around for fernand but he had disappeared   153.18514545122835
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain   175.6409464690405
cried the duchess   128.06363990852742
you have truly monsieur said d artagnan bowing again a courtesy for which i assure you i am very grateful   87.25341276270477
a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum across   201.76022321676373
but that is not all continued danglars   85.52762810484197
and he pointed out to d artagnan the scratch he had remembered   65.30888343482985
come said anne tis reasonable since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed   119.37926994030039
if he has raised it he can put it down   111.05258494471516
well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him   115.17877550399307
if louis xviii   176.6336401895255
said athos pressing his hand   136.82076586726703
oh yes he cried that was my only prayer at last   58.64848460615231
i will then release you from all your promises even that of procuring my admission into the musketeers   135.28517133533865
then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it   105.0061112611156
but tell me it is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say   108.10531512727526
the lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little negro and the maid servant   107.89445905937772
he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken   73.67787404664088
if he has forgotten you mercédès   147.01229492817535
the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot   234.8031003187047
monsieur man in a hurry you can find me without running me you understand   76.66056890748642
but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight   135.76564038026638
why surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us   130.26776973068897
what though payable at rome   138.17564104038385
franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal   106.13197627196307
it is true she said the arch hypocrite see   132.96502966165835
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d artagnan   65.66448201159852
it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty   63.62813137216493
the lights again   81.34900991028158
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor s misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him   107.38381224989693
what have i done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me   113.74042889543101
thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a churchman   76.33650344200757
i will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he doesn t speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away   93.74403322665012
d artagnan seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard   119.678569117548
the blow so they tell me at least was struck with a master s hand   130.1670505589473
exclaimed d artagnan stopping the carriage   148.40916404589794
de villefort said renée becoming more and more terrified   185.7142302298898
bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled   89.25211284222922
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness   236.0327796335913
come now said athos you are joking   87.96132176210065
don t you know that i was in my youth a poet   121.2547897033838
danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery   123.68524299588915
it shall be done replied bertuccio   157.52941318050688
she only speaks romaic   79.57293339855998
the young officer preserved silence   88.80356955575309
what ails you   166.68344973439923
be assured i shall save you   158.40276858472737
who is that   118.91979119663318
aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell   91.53292706137134
the villefort family vault two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten o clock in the morning around the door of m   127.94680100597377
dead you may raise your head and say i am the son of him you killed because for the first time he has been compelled to break his word   241.86292351915455
he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy   100.70820391607799
the noble animals bounded forward   133.96591480353695
the duc de blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate   127.17519511029758
well said cucumetto have you executed your commission   129.14795069925356
debray in pacifying a kingdom   138.66361778992265
ah sir said d artagnan you have a wicked smile   112.09431667392285
the procurator seeing he was going invited him to dinner an invitation which the musketeer refused with a majestic air   118.55652170133887
be kind enough then to reply to me in the same language   137.8748381352932
a sort of book written upon strips of cloth   41.91377289105938
without caring about them myself i live among those who are much occupied in them   117.42394702176968
proceed said monte cristo   56.08712766857695
are you not he asked the priest who here in the château d if is generally thought to be ill   170.86319789226445
he lodges at the hôtel des princes   108.63793491080337
besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them   135.59473820348208
you know that i care nothing for my title   130.41240398944973
de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france   121.21605280831439
i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me   75.76466183646662
ah monsieur said d artagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to monsieur de la fere our liberty   92.54482002766864
yes three on horseback and three who have dismounted   207.02925476016173
noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himself an intervention which had saved them from despair   74.35914401177969
said he what does that mean   83.63278521309942
i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de villefort   107.59165645331153
a gentleman and a diplomatist   94.09603312664588
madame danglars turned very pale then exclaimed i can not believe it   104.44186029854286
yes if my friends agree   135.36977477117767
edmond then resolved to try jacopo and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize money but jacopo refused it indignantly   179.7359964274136
the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven   151.02078582691072
the englishman entered and found morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his liabilities   126.4163377585378
keep your ill humor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them   54.943355353071155
you must lay in a stock of hilarity   107.90103283276126
i mean spinach replied aramis   32.08117511782328
the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint   90.44440942071805
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me   160.91185657688754
the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door   179.17571188619755
his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed   184.07604800914413
then the countess g has returned to paris has she   146.41901527486203
chapter x   134.53491064465553
really that demoiselle d aubigne is very charming   167.0245288592378
my dear little love   99.27826879479721
melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world   90.64162517440097
you must try to see her and have an explanation with her   207.77312534450903
but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bastion   116.12946947729083
the jesuit persisted in his opinion   87.1931123056444
the cardinal smiled   89.16488159639408
monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room   154.26468712536933
valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise   65.63027883386945
daughter of a prince i restore to you the riches and name of your father   197.7230699350631
charles stuart you are our prisoner   150.31423224153806
but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss   116.11205594627623
besides i might be deceived   152.37651324601757
you have water woods flowers there   127.2133281600774
you lie you lie   119.31763355370967
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved   114.2401620779561
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin   233.77011602296852
but in the first place this woman i have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke   97.97483721969817
sir what gratitude i feel   128.08202404426873
they opened it and found 900 000 francs in bank scrip   130.88408684626773
on perceiving the cavaliers d artagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh   37.996758465091375
his brow was not one of those that long remain clear   76.19465277151026
do you know me madame   187.28605712563632
have with you for one throw   161.55940842154658
but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin where three or four men went and came like shadows   147.21448712296532
why said albert he was talked about for a week   89.99116692198182
inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio s story   66.89691542325926
it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law   103.77414881556842
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said athos   70.35359975352806
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words   20.882541541526322
all my hopes are blighted my heart is broken my life a burden everything around me is sad and mournful   57.818804651874274
we say slowly for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts   99.54154480932084
and she threw herself into his arms holding in her extended hand a red netted silk purse   148.03676975054572
who calls richelieu calls satan   102.05026834017666
the man remained in the village   58.33082022859475
this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it   232.91375133816888
the room was neatly comfortably furnished   67.70929894564998
and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is   125.89336800645002
monsieur du tremblay received d artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake   220.18691742265136
my poor child replied monte cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you   85.91361093180024
monsieur that my dear father is here   4.10210544409081
replied aramis becoming as pale as death   29.732722818125225
to prevent recognition said d artagnan   156.45453399433376
i should my dear d artagnan have been so but nature said no   158.75071385916902
at the sight of d artagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken   83.78712408467398
and i my lord said d artagnan accept it as it is given   77.51392395953152
whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return   72.89326075813428
he listened to know whence this sound could proceed   55.67187830855794
and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious   61.37803723125381
i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount   91.1072634101338
it was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much   0.2653049088847723
see how the artist peeps out   173.4088537899461
i own myself conquered   49.2043774713586
he drew the corks and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat   118.41063673090076
as for me replied aramis i have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputation of which i formed one went yesterday to saint germain to impose on you   211.17358673928584
then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand come i had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson i only wanted a murder and here it is   100.66422947237076
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count   119.86453925014605
if it is true he shall be free   43.33794612364822
to the palais royal he called out   109.85946780467557
now gentlemen cried the king forward   103.51454038196373
this battle won by me the king will have no further resources in england or in scotland   59.32129055941631
but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners   123.34097312207814
monte cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear   11.581261001700028
the cardinal took the queen s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips   178.8779982371256
and thus they parted the best possible friends and m   65.68723913249572
i am a machine then and nothing else and so long as i work nothing more is required of me   106.13939540019808
could you have imagined this scene château renaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract   96.34245232378515
so you defend him   88.38647442369192
it will not be so difficult replied d artagnan springing to the ground   174.02375720255745
baptistin   165.19274362539284
more especially since your wishes coincide with mine and as soon as m   58.11293263323467
the house as i said is between the court and the garden   152.97667023084074
your eminence it concerns the war which the king my husband is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects   85.02388289246346
d artagnan examined her with a rapid glance   79.36381805208609
i read the advertisement in one of the papers and was tempted by the false title a country house   50.32382903745865
often before his captivity dantès mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers   41.915450049767074
the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired   77.73192181036713
reverend sir murmured caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blocked reverend sir i don t know believe me i take my oath a pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forced it is tolerably evident caderousse was choking   99.91025858243943
franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the hôtel de londres was the palace   93.57107006130833
let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence   101.75134758464586
something better still mouston   143.76289693870584
it is she   100.08887261810781
are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears   73.22696278704282
and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged   184.38094251184688
again that accusation   99.2809334671255
from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon   86.83163854943618
while fighting and retreating as i have told monseigneur he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him and as the door was open he took out the key and barricaded himself inside   128.02999152520013
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts   112.890573523326
speak or no absolution   241.8525377659755
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here   31.085058196876332
oh my heart   146.21454030231564
the same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus   82.75159192168633
the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring   94.00058423923349
thank you edmond   153.39073176692625
in the left side was it not and with a knife   74.3632528732109
valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction   31.920925309016056
asked madame danglars shuddering   211.26870489972433
and clement vii   106.58525901152473
but what can four men or rather three men do for i tell you you must not count on monsieur d artagnan   139.8734358328298
a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over   218.23454060556531
the same expression continued   165.75626881399984
i bought my experience dearly particularly fair women   144.05874471876191
the rapier had pierced his bosom   131.97082323736817
of what did he die   64.5025477980517
sire i have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the south   145.8508266698671
why then have you laid it aside   185.49245195378114
god may seem sometimes to forget for a time while his justice reposes but there always comes a moment when he remembers and behold a proof   98.37662042285308
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black   268.63437625863753
and what is this condition   124.3371418484196
ah said he you have remarked i must have been blind not to have seen   163.78877493375347
shall we return together   148.773556502992
and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage   205.5709450590897
or rather to observe the chronological order i and d artagnan replied athos   32.18821910005805
tis i really i   133.36233403605692
but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life   55.01575684535713
repeated m   156.5742201400984
one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body   112.55029596182139
and you aramis you were going i think to visit madame de longueville   153.5068009940498
i do not mean that for you blacas continued louis xviii   57.58656451419739
stay here is another louis for you   120.77828957649399
the field of battle instead therefore of being at saint denis or at charenton will be near compiegne or villars cotterets   76.9762458007981
but without taking any heed of the sword milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat   63.49915053297051
from a distance they perceived aramis seated in a melancholy manner at his window looking out like sister anne at the dust in the horizon   104.61949406077055
scarcely had i covered it with earth when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me   134.42220664925946
and did your superior order you to treat me in this way   123.93243124951998
the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling costume   119.264659439031
who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity   172.0272908205619
monsieur d artagnan is not with me   106.08073237523152
touching unanimity   72.00602870041888
but i wish to see the governor   84.7308089954856
come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree   139.00532166841938
but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me   46.581019451506904
his grace the duke of buckingham will not set out for france   70.4150448674802
is the committee willing to hear this witness   81.55198167367574
tomorrow morning i start for paris   115.53350008484136
here are two hundred said andrea   11.205210641087419
pray learn monsieur olivain that people like us are not to be served by cowards   135.18986615738805
men may subdue men they can not overcome the elements   92.4144693816705
the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice milady s condescension   110.56134812705405
but as i can not and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier s gallery   78.24013724375777
his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel   122.55753780711622
the superior and mme   163.56740812840022
you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly   93.24812938442868
under orders from general cromwell   85.61858796807371
then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied juxon   81.09470217468225
ah madame de chevreuse was less cruel than you   127.3130565827946
all four were to meet the next day at eleven o clock   173.68155985549345
tis capital   165.4137838878013
there is nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter   56.72845913804595
cried aramis i may have done some good   54.03910604326963
as to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them   97.46416707549932
mazarin sighed   171.9103162848436
we need not say she stopped at the first floor   97.67307817142316
at this moment and as though the utterance of villefort s wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear   98.35253454041107
i have almost given them away as it is   4.145159742714711
now my dear guitant i have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable memory   63.70234517950242
cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly   45.88377558684316
ah here is my mother cried the viscount   163.01079355721882
let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door   100.58354756504963
for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance   138.96540070449444
for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspires is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon   155.65763039417521
felton continued to descend   158.29956140502773
dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him   137.18413484264474
it is evident that you wish to avoid her   81.28440660184984
now said tréville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend   167.2143944540964
then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him   91.987435264563
i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed   119.09301387514618
are you disposed to obey count de rochefort   103.17621750810547
there is a will   181.47120162562885
suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at vampa   81.3208648201568
then here s to our next merry meeting   145.7892129190261
and i can answer for his having been up these two hours   154.63824906177558
said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required   65.64071879493162
he felt that in returning to camp he should re enter slavery   69.58947298627267
we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross   114.54083520119873
the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eyes   110.94944595859005
do you permit me to return   107.50896092021868
these were the ancestors of charles standing back dimly in their tarnished frames   140.20687683555886
and he suffered almost as much as poor kitty who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber   49.20422647916675
athos asked uneasily   134.76886804939588
that tells me their name and nothing else   121.82221028798867
choose one of us to replace the comte de la fere   114.89013758836181
but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a musketeer i wore an enormous cloak said aramis   78.96636711557358
her eye alone lived and glared horribly   109.14275655995158
said andrea my servant s coat and my hat   183.50603488069387
then suddenly struck with an idea i am saved   186.18809468260434
the officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform   151.37840790648133
monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures   178.4687159388203
well said dantès mark this   179.91522795350988
the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held   47.61219050320142
how convenient that there s a bench here   158.08653979819508
i promise you that   130.52415610882238
but he stopped doubtless to reflect   90.08882384402442
saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor   135.25403586299714
he had made up his mind to write to her the next day   171.4451383477079
as i am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your turn   142.74565528248357
with the queen i double her risk   121.1575170065149
he s posted there   197.0006939267898
and then must not all be over   67.29433147823563
bonacieux and the duke entered the louvre without difficulty   100.54546386446539
but if he be willing to accept my offers will you oppose them   141.8656941251005
soon he saw the lights of la consigne   108.30508786783352
d artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him on his departure   55.0678081573386
and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmond s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts   68.59008945980236
noirtier looked at valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him   71.730779144339
tis caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return   83.96708805124604
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent   66.87862444439611
they questioned   109.0181292269916
where was she   70.84176868821277
whilst all this was going on athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st   84.73448191657133
ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind   53.38141595711571
various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast   148.73283814271903
night came   32.66476386255877
instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry   108.32465698219147
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence   89.3356277913566
there s a reason   152.74312451786295
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket   21.74019818771866
on the cross cried i rising for at that abhorred voice i had recovered all my strength on the cross i swear that no promise no menace no force no torture shall close my mouth   123.27373889360211
it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me   65.15550535949377
no no be easy on that score   130.59699438962616
d artagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before   118.78477894159167
until then you will not see me   127.78160753762654
near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto   121.2233806209351
juxon was waiting for him impatiently   71.39362648434049
you understand my dear girl continued d artagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in   151.17717336967436
villefort s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary   182.68758095702077
do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual   108.90655816727495
you know what it is to love my lord   169.71946021325928
madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase   126.02141230580557
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony   169.1330455325438
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses   162.0614115778274
d artagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands   219.33902671409965
you have seen your dream realized   80.13179812524436
sir you have distracted me   148.609400063762
and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal   66.15525387051014
when pressed they will confess everything   157.84518741519165
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variétés   137.7931934322038
in all probability we shall never see him   110.65895595216098
this   129.14954798755238
certainly my dear sir   12.827932658435785
it was that paper you read this morning   211.975851636271
i count upon it   74.81762709889534
in an instant all five were ready   99.90853163107144
that is all i wished to know   90.24540935613486
timidly asked the old soldier   139.62439122225862
you hear sir said d artagnan turning to mordaunt   41.66598614661706
well my friend i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much   131.9746932783188
the lackeys were brought by the cries she made   136.1569353110145
were heard above all the noise deafening as it was   146.5605084699974
and in exchange for all that not even a scratch   122.33781180761032
i was not aware my alms were so well invested   92.86958872267955
yes sir replied the coachman   84.561083761477
these active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor   206.4515238526385
milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked d artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england   8.776577637147156
and yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with mme   77.29932156320729
the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless recollect   106.40127152046249
morrel called her and she ran to the gate   82.86499990693696
mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength   142.53479458609186
then turning to mazarin now my lord let us enter if you please   165.87038440051674
but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spot his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets   146.20800720050863
he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life   82.84515810369038
grimaud appeared   65.64883797953433
sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords   145.95859130185872
which interrupted the duchess is now brought up against her as a great crime   97.40187735751944
d artagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited   202.00926125178745
wasn t his name faria   178.77093955415086
enough sir said morcerf we will speak no more on the subject   131.4730737416622
this voice startled her   56.92003892792644
have you finished grimaud   120.32051218827455
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement   99.49626770323951
i obey my captain s orders   91.91366493252704
30079m how kind you are   110.35928101664683
de villefort the king s attorney   90.00662306810608
if the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice   176.86947467421538
sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world   133.67984189960322
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips   8.290943992281896
i agree monsieur   112.12768779169744
five millions why what a crœsus you are   103.32050354191516
many others said he would not appear   57.446234847712624
i have just had the pleasure replied the count   100.43303456104735
both sir he has both fortune and position both   95.08491554380629
how have you spent this 250 000 francs   80.73388292965626
spur your horses   153.0285599674865
explained porthos stepping forward   118.73430335916517
wait here for me   138.37662900087915
as you say mazarin is a knave   103.600631803538
but if he doesn t return   112.02039095172032
and kill him said porthos   28.324217493476752
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside   191.8500259364307
villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered   18.82667319939219
dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier   134.47946741704072
it appears too you kept him waiting a long time at boulogne   162.84222150470333
0079m certainly not   94.64479668522448
of perugino of raphael of manners customs of the famous aqua tofana of which they had told you i think you said that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret   82.30406951254265
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose   90.9659394906344
anne of austria stretched forth her hand closing her eyes and leaning with the other upon estafania for she felt that her strength was about to fail her   117.24870701351294
the cold sweat sprang to the young man s brow and his teeth chattered   94.2668116384614
what my own feeling is you already know   145.8128645578057
my dear groslow answered mordaunt you know the french proverb nothing one does not do one s self is ever well done   148.71621767408672
d artagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of milady   150.0507300081535
when you leave this you will behold my men at work   78.81107383552347
said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult   187.79186310689437
no boat   119.72288253872995
athos surmised what had taken place and smiled   110.55437130651096
ah i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not   214.7479311425023
oh yes tired enough he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day   197.89236370554514
cried porthos coming forward   107.68211610098403
i ve ten guards behind me don t you hear them gallop   96.76251539751328
he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw   87.58257970408924
madame said la meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh   29.70054524334546
excuse me sir said baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but i think i see a carriage down there under the trees   109.98254692481119
then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket   122.20335764322628
i was at rome during the last carnival   103.9658257636304
that s true said the procurator s wife groaning that unfortunate outfit   218.10458198358808
planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and mousqueton   115.74362511522813
a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no maximilian this must not be for many reasons   114.81363702115064
in the corridor he again met the pretty kitty   138.6069324956961
30303m and what are his claims to the peerage   119.06371069159361
time dear friend time brings round opportunity   177.7134785226512
if you prefer another name it   77.63156732712139
what is it grimaud   122.62480681221582
but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army   237.7898023570732
pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my excuse   144.2494552024812
now said athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and i will watch   7.6261764684606845
i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied   146.52608317775162
whither are you taking me   112.7638575201243
then taking him aside he whispered to him thou hast done right   124.2236029990726
i will say and do nothing until i am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever   84.95915001673012
the latter a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty two years active and lively the true soubrette of a great lady jumped from the step upon which according to the custom of the time she was seated and took her way toward the terrace upon which d artagnan had perceived lubin   78.70897449598012
he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished a shadow in the darkness   93.90531363577242
dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment   121.2389788848185
what has become of the minister   86.53540348157678
the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived   127.83697248705602
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden   103.38140170166352
farewell said charles farewell my children   202.46117685718536
family joys have no charm for me   211.6740255006158
you know it do you not   142.69846649093233
could you allow me a few words in private   149.41243281653738
take mousqueton   247.90642085933436
and you have heard his fortune mentioned   83.88228341573497
it was very polite of you   122.85189241827504
this clever person is your relative then   92.96138783017618
the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier   114.52925751240943
and do you believe he knew you again kitty   125.87368654285237
yes said milady   93.17592012997498
it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs   98.8884620311546
50279m an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel   84.21693468388025
thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam i have all i want   57.220243635578754
a moment later he came down again holding in his hand the small shagreen case which he opened to assure himself it contained the diamond seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in then as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his head   104.56927491581203
he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf   128.4780090094904
felton himself might now be watched   135.05044169523006
my dear athos i wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest for a fortnight   142.8240728829516
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence   82.42335713381553
i will not sleep where i must scorn   140.48851801406465
if not in the name of god at least in your own name   127.82389111275472
de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held   120.72535464385179
let him come and he will find a change i will answer for it   50.99954504326422
40132m andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hare s paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable ill temper   59.631488695870914
that my orders go far madame   4.3438635482563654
cried the old soldier   167.38609896927852
he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished passed only a few hours in the day there and rarely slept there   85.91158020299572
where is thy master   180.75565825099255
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers   85.32448536307173
the sailors did not require much urging   96.35576381540722
shall i ring   78.15407325144339
on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame as she always did on saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice   93.52597274651521
benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced   34.819169902352925
the longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca   122.16095093223457
said d artagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted pardieu it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend s house   149.09808173431043
he would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him   124.58876459222698
i wait and listen   117.37822245233966
on what subject shall i converse with her   102.59945279773895
tell the captain we are coming   92.9205327957487
a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid   70.33674626292644
he was hungry   114.2593259227234
but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder   71.7765198491033
defend yourself   146.52241714308164
he launched into a eulogy of his eminence and said that he should not have failed to enter into the guards of the cardinal instead of the king s guards if he had happened to know m   111.12931157657856
but before six months you with your music and i with my voice we shall double our capital   102.49316474961435
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence   89.2990920153629
the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriage window   165.976646754993
i will write to him then nearly in these terms   67.51193666861596
said the baroness   169.1264801757354
she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body   73.00554559858304
grimaud drew out a pistol   88.78762669585873
it was brought to me   146.00419366002376
you call yourself in paris the count of monte cristo   150.5532729199685
i believe she is detained in france by some love affair   226.46996431652127
i mean the russian prince who you said had 30 000 livres and we only found 22 000   74.97758477087503
d artagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing   140.33129774330413
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face   146.8560196711732
listen my dear my adored valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone   80.67935271317187
d artagnan comprehended their irresolution   156.87652366018344
albert with his eyes closed was standing grasping the window curtains   112.58585478526334
now since d artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way   96.35499934253772
i am obliged to you guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity   32.456320677062834
but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy   147.98436087735533
the cannonade of the isle of ré presaged to him the dragonnades of the cévennes   158.1616878279486
this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king   54.71543094607209
there are the fifty louis i faith said aramis emptying the purse on the table all bearing the effigy of louis xiii   147.6974686810176
to day monsieur   96.69132135598194
as soon as lord de winter saw buckingham was dead he ran to felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace   78.03718295026611
he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first story   85.84318083516617
de tréville calling him back   137.02755440847545
here is a pardon for one of the prisoners   145.40707177325515
he rose however as they approached   92.77334114367092
albert in his turn sat behind   169.04374649909315
it appears to me said d artagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore   184.18180032227582
we will give them money   134.73845412505918
ah if i were in your place said albert   190.13837966969584
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him   124.28469799476254
enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me   152.0598528719488
you will send him to me   69.45448255076889
words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step   189.0849514951974
i only wish he would let me take his place   152.04998383689517
he fancied that they buried the dead at the château d if and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the château frustrated his projects   75.66673325579679
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage   166.1745502086686
said beauchamp in a calm tone   142.45420910655014
shall i tell you what you ought to do morcerf   186.74981046054913
a carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching   133.1547277579401
what is your sister valentine doing   151.83621638572322
this time however his address although polite was cooler than usual   65.89362007990175
upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself   99.36145839206593
place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of felton   89.44610056004979
he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife port   134.9654907944695
monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificent pistols   61.03861269395224
in fact the dream of poor bazin had always been to serve a churchman   74.14658817721127
your pardon sir said milady with mildness   113.01194545346965
you will not find one better carved between albano and civita castellana   135.8796231885766
for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day   87.18695332893077
do you know what has become of athos   186.21971253343486
i had been told that you had endeavored to escape   57.122900274502626
it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a vice   110.50379772252433
the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the defence   92.63007111636017
the jailer brought him his breakfast   102.92143972174163
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner   177.52998456929492
he is an excellent person   118.0552362803064
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days   142.6154768453296
come monsieur   24.233034281484578
well i was not hot headed then well but what else could you play for   105.91374511068595
nothing nothing replied the priest   51.326632201975926
well sir asked franz what do you wish me to do with this paper   143.2054502097788
the interior of the musketeers when d artagnan was out of the louvre and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles athos advised him to order a good repast at the pomme de pin porthos to engage a lackey and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress   164.07299943298065
i shall rely on it   79.70831376617441
of course i have   104.48915793838673
and i feel no doubt that thanks to d artagnan s ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts   97.373180572581
in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio whose servant he had been   77.98792996247765
luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house   51.716040659645685
a thousand thanks for your honorable company which has saved me from all the dangers to which alone i was exposed   34.582658478529325
now gascons are always poor are they not   42.06055178140474
one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier   188.75331048737502
here he said take this pocket book   157.83402979932532
and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on here   74.00823219075522
besides i don t prevent you from listening but i must be gone   87.15722475912858
never sir said raoul as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall i deem i have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me   115.79323212517481
a lesson   87.39796936661416
how do you know i was praying sir   162.0254236728403
the king s procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism   159.6109910515347
and now what do you want   83.17995772523304
if he were rich if he had cavalcanti s fortune that might be pardoned   200.7732840823853
you your command and i my title   40.02844049166818
you see i have not these necessary papers   171.56897385574672
if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility   177.04136423002313
in saying these words d artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved   216.39402666794194
benedetto the count s son   128.72920670807503
i am enormously anxious to finish my night at the duke of bracciano s   60.734257674729676
make all your arrangements and tell me where i shall be able to find you this evening at ten o clock   11.878941996747187
if you do not go sir said de guiche remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be   172.9468803290053
and your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name   32.49471398440244
monsieur said mademoiselle d aubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voiture s friends   98.33793675445486
de tréville the guards to that of m   128.27208588443423
yes dear monsieur porthos   140.18349133822264
d épinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition   112.71761087229771
one day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution i also wished to kill myself   88.91266728590946
yes but he has been avenged   59.45961795449189
display is not becoming to everyone m   96.19700680305547
my dear porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said d artagnan with a look as if he spoke against his conviction   102.85885800159352
besides make yourselves easy   204.2657601183248
touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly   48.47175332479473
this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking it   106.09984123663318
but how did he obtain it   118.02457366134406
danglars trembled too   84.19047189220579
the paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent   171.9953005087237
plenty   144.29844534947512
we have made considerable advances   161.10371568052634
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host   54.02388391216139
and then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herself of no one but herself   51.89655559142135
i begin and without any rhetoric   89.52210944238257
five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to danglars house   144.20536229754475
it is very natural   128.389228059795
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls   106.1268602939652
there go three or four limping away   93.30847806166553
said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere   105.48726924286986
upon this promise d artagnan withdrew and the next day he began service   213.19638996176334
oh said valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear m   100.183077080889
that is the crime of which i accuse her   129.8066912214319
then you were about to tell me all the isolation of your life the griefs of your heart   106.65307193712536
said madame de villefort in a harsh and constrained tone   83.00057239591044
never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up   70.89647218421791
he s not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms   118.98393645501845
returned the abbé listen to what i have to say   80.9190758905614
and you think that to save such villains as you i will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes   95.81794259586817
oh more than i can say kitty   137.72041533649406
he approached her and said in a low voice has your majesty still confidence in me   174.01681697810966
our passport   60.77245060264379
then you must have something on your mind   119.50378075579023
interrupted the stranger   178.91443610503222
laugh as much as you will replied albert i am in love   100.59526936906555
he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas   248.75429934143787
for heaven s sake don t laugh for upon my soul it s no laughing matter   130.88213896651808
tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england   174.43172158312774
do not deceive yourself   91.8180329692518
it was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity   97.6368980423374
i have heard that name in greece   150.78230493907049
sometimes with the queen of england sometimes with madame de chevreuse   157.84439475822126
athos may always be found replied tréville ready to answer when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him   155.65130762597366
the count of monte cristo had just entered   64.40453177710641
d artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions as the breakfast at the priest s could only be counted as half a repast in return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him   80.04205050500954
laporte assured himself by having it twice repeated of the accurate address and set off at a run   90.60186214002138
sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction   108.52098548567488
noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild   51.03912008913049
the sword   94.65719208676387
it gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but i have said nothing either to the one or to the other   155.20608973796416
replied monte cristo astonished in his turn   158.65889642504015
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril   123.97092337976
the child conceals it   157.063765071384
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work   75.63843283845185
the doctor turned pale   161.51903306161267
and don t you play too when you are on guard   119.790020828835
for a man is above that sort of thing   112.29450189224622
in this case he was not the judge but the executioner   60.377381329530586
yes yes that is true   43.80812752596887
after shutting the gate behind them i pretended to return to the house but i immediately went out a back door and stealing along in the shade of the hedge i gained yonder clump of elder from which i could hear and see everything   106.94764810926563
de villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon   78.20948352634974
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them   128.5628769085902
then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows   38.10405423032351
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of sèvres   146.7003573981801
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable   138.81261458707704
exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention   101.58993248250015
he had not seen morrel   139.99556540686305
he caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your guard   106.91628812219273
through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind not of the woman but of the poet   103.79543561876754
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many colored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles   117.83698675968594
d artagnan heard the door close   80.5860874970425
take one of the carriage lamps bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments   103.52600754815072
i have not lost my time   62.608684803364014
i suspected where she was concealed   28.199986051013113
he came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously said   120.65676147477721
at the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bastion   38.848345785053425
ali as my model   102.24600265346587
believe me continued tréville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set out   113.00359915962125
i will await her return and beg her to come up here   144.9448109250875
and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence   101.63848650124746
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty   173.43187465957737
that when once the order was signed by buckingham and buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name and he could not therefore recognize the woman in question once this order was signed we say the baron would make her embark immediately and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world whose style the voice of fashion lauds and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors   165.88444358880477
listen attentively   202.5504454450337
five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father   109.38547183198907
but your father was not allowed to fall   125.92152385514663
exclaimed madame danglars   143.7998840200465
well said porthos seated in the courtyard of the hotel de la chevrette to d artagnan who with a long and melancholy face had returned from the palais royal   104.0446164205396
why do you ask me that   205.56549111197455
it was the point where he had embarked   146.1057108650148
20355m scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars dear hermine i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom i little expected to see today   148.67212850892398
peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out   88.21185967282196
oh yes said château renaud   84.9401176410318
a dead horse   101.02907572420403
i have brought my receipt   185.61479524736092
mazarin disappeared as they rose from table   216.95137852139123
magloire a little frequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each end   132.35109248474674
i make no requests or commands   174.24536500303418
not of my own   146.86364424667713
but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it   150.88393891467302
here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum   157.51508726928103
we need not add that the goldsmith o reilly and his assistant were prohibited from going out under any pretext   80.65501373896427
anne de bueil   100.55539829527376
this was a blow to d artagnan   154.04760368069014
i said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the scottish army   131.10302805167913
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement   135.63287422629412
monte cristo took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black hair which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features   111.08359389201046
have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it   3.295702374987968
and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire   116.19564997815947
can it not be put off till to morrow   118.89536520861941
yes excellency returned the steward   61.36027379961261
exclaimed mazarin   84.50907170537948
andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation   84.23984221285363
honor   172.01627700442867
but true parisian as he was bonacieux could recognize every street by the milestones the signs and the lamps   159.3967972807758
and by whom were they recommended to you   142.403880077958
we have asked him for money   98.74036647067851
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you   97.74439273940334
i am your prisoner said aramis giving up his sword to porthos   56.323174264272524
asked debray in a whisper of madame danglars   108.02471254814579
the justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of god   129.67528042324116
he cried with his gascon accent   72.96268195365246
you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances   169.35910984000418
the two young men he announced were indeed approaching   84.28205609060498
from time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer   63.81103575320119
request him to come here directly   115.7965945421076
it is agreed is it not   90.86389281300157
we met in the place royale egad   121.85675358840422
two soldiers said d artagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes   160.3346571439455
the swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold   153.2524645490232
fool   177.8870711298182
that the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of m   102.44246646951082
is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself   124.38862858920913
if she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least   130.6355944907172
but first of all pray have a servant father   199.08510675813542
do you know his house at auteuil   119.24606936177705
he is following me   115.30295724285284
i am going alone   160.32239481063817
but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man   94.60896532734321
the drums beat   122.61557769000282
a frenchman   75.6844706985747
happily for him he has ceased to bear that name   181.28646277607675
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity   86.55117623776906
monte cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay   123.14985128580928
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master   95.06896906526677
he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight   114.41273956297829
lord a mercy my lord   127.0630494907729
is he still in a fit   136.97755601627165
i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of mastrilla   143.5082829865325
furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the puritans   121.90133912621363
yes egad   69.27237506585863
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone   155.08879954632783
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king   144.14417865091679
but asked madame danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent m   102.52928406160507
she made him a sign to dismount and come to her   108.06555780338422
at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him   89.47815408170291
and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes   217.5512330072575
yes yes i understand said danglars and then in a low tone he added to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him   81.28870366440202
instead of aiding the movements of my horse i paralyzed them   65.02622508375998
in the donjon of vincennes   190.8515799643838
she that was enceinte she who was walking while she waited for bertuccio stood at the open door with his eyes starting and his hair on end   126.31148868600981
how they must be asking where is the cardinal   98.5398703849566
avenged yourself said the baron   104.84060770749844
they are only four   93.24980946339656
had you known this edmond dantès of whom they spoke   106.1496943672537
i think you wished to do so of your own accord   133.66136790835324
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators   83.2585199331313
but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence   35.94763520438609
in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of st   54.842198075545014
mouston cried porthos   88.92299634953719
athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr king   134.57836565076295
and did you go alone   156.26802465593755
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go on i listen   150.45703747201497
then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse   151.3807823820686
now i understand he said why you had me brought here to this desolate spot in the midst of the ocean to this subterranean palace   23.73553764295768
ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and albert that they were at liberty to pass on   167.55944205218472
for heaven s sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heaven s sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch   177.11178430964483
why then was it impossible to dantès   90.0932681761353
gendarmes said the president lead in the accused   146.53675438284944
i am sure of it they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step   114.63423396587474
he opened his arms and haydée uttering a cry sprang into them   168.80906863637838
said the curate mechanically   58.93343743878315
oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable   170.47993923737812
do not be uneasy said mazarin   161.6447819124327
but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it   104.95746946843157
you can never have so much as i wish you   111.78198104085989
for believe me but for you i should have ceased to live on the day i doubted my father and renounced his name   114.4254777399363
and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step   53.526424325318196
but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of position a superiority which edmond had concealed from all others   134.612299173146
at the appointed hour i shall be ready   75.84305573452022
may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out   125.82046476978012
50113m well i must confess these are scruples   117.84112759255693
you forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master   173.8354862415964
i wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit   56.45866881466127
they spread their cloaks   83.72214103418858
at this moment the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining room   87.97049458642111
my story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me   135.09060071675134
what the truly guilty   197.92597136656855
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key   104.84936339999112
d artagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred   62.29269076035589
the stranger smiled a melancholy smile   171.150526050145
so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character   102.80504183849561
land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor   35.74077049662566
yes indeed my dear duke   233.06933843706088
then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen i was afraid you were dangerously ill   164.4042305232133
no i remain replied athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed   149.97370925203617
i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal   128.76901059538682
the host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk   186.7769728647765
these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace   94.69504214416611
eh how can i tell   193.46691221457309
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise   111.0073668729626
question him then   56.114050745241826
he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard   169.1609119671358
you know it was agreed you should put in there   106.2627112495151
providence has declared for us since i have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner   134.37389422092835
porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder   110.04611263014176
caderousse had once more parted with his treasure the banknotes were replaced in the pocket book the gold put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard   137.33865123377504
the duke exchanged a signal with them   131.33439066784905
yes said the count yes   181.8115342341045
at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raoul s horse waving his parti colored cap and crying broussel   160.11606002465248
dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joy everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in   125.9684225932815
you must be cruelly bored here   168.45723753723158
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly   119.35328139854492
his chin had joined his throat   117.3977856722748
when all had gone out and the door was closed m   143.1345803966068
obey that person implicitly   77.22408196251203
bonacieux what is it   225.29942863017317
well fernand i must say said caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover   95.4213525830884
make your complaints known   115.74302849699176
and if you come another fathom nearer i ll stave your wicked head in with this oar   88.05299106477533
ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious   174.6425731178555
alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villefort s departure   138.94488776588506
i shall want you this evening he said return in two hours   144.18299272952515
at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star   111.3531544506231
andrea had fled   122.57541940327346
they are no robbers but assassins   98.47433468557742
the matter is replied d artagnan that i can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman   170.34552387005994
he extended a hand to raoul and said my young friend all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here   140.78436656125407
we know that said beauchamp   102.52128910145565
but my mother as a child saw her   129.6448313230196
and when shall i be avenged   87.06688281431892
well then that is settled   133.25582457632441
perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husband a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death   94.88169535567421
you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz   141.88235962038053
gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the two prisoners whom i can not leave   145.6212841252102
carmela was precisely the age and figure of teresa and teresa was as handsome as carmela   72.10490566085498
twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand and twice had villefort soothed him with promises   116.84409626170377
ah cried d artagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me   161.12710857004151
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed   150.32301554118493
bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo   109.10953840222861
he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder   150.11139682440043
and monsieur d artagnan of whom you spoke just now monsieur d herblay   166.8659746033959
mother nanette   107.90621115053132
and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it   46.99501728812294
there was a moment s silence   128.1234208786065
then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and d artagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what i should say to it   113.19489598343665
we can find out said grimaud   102.14758385536472
you have not forgotten st   141.66178365851283
has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep   137.89421591831567
yes said felton   74.60363322536205
as to the man to be depended upon i have him under my hand monsieur said m   105.10836824853357
a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses   93.6434461410752
i saw you were unhappy and your unhappiness interested me   133.03653512121437
chapter 3   121.19892858637797
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son   85.39891262541266
it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented   65.75830905866792
besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine   181.7440760621871
who has consoled me in my sorrow but he   54.45982788422898
i know what is become of vasiliki and haydée   144.4225906126645
not of providence but of fate   98.1201473973008
and the other one   156.3716949499691
and continued he casting a side glance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugénie is pretty i think i remember that to be her name   69.84429667997959
your eminence will judge the ball of madame the constable   191.39696166209418
it was ten o clock at night   121.0070917021396
a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal s hat   58.71908491739341
for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths   143.46658506919934
very young i presume   44.6524200528318
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter   123.12391010645742
this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god   76.16130860470639
what have i done then   133.9053353073622
after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl a piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst   145.42180987965767
tell me may i shake hands with you saying beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must i simply propose to you a choice of arms   174.36650862585427
mademoiselle danglars   226.68116067829504
one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome   84.44302633143838
he answered in the same language   75.20572183408612
and raoul what shall you do with him   110.42216611905225
it was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man   157.49434469637086
the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his guest   126.72955806358071
how could i know what i was the bearer of   179.79150429054957
demanded d artagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering it   98.05023251766619
young edward   52.94329897725516
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could   106.44873903314068
on y va coming exclaimed peppino who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms   73.47322113319899
want one   124.05050094533011
there was no occasion to push the door it was wide open   133.72902321718178
don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies   100.7852194854352
at nine o clock the night had fully come   163.061674490123
i defy you to find him who executed it   148.59216679752507
i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris   154.30908167924292
sir said chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen   58.547653307643735
on the way we escaped   88.76014641954978
planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment   112.63880660294946
however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating   179.94236531379983
so franz must wait   121.05363854108087
i do not say i regret   130.32388224667568
morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair   84.71338267324498
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent   116.88480627155971
another might threaten to seek m   162.84584430213437
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them   92.2804442843609
merciful goodness   131.40065244524092
omer   138.7237313907657
pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch   147.4888735403651
the comte de rochefort   71.65983102348181
another valet was engaged for himself a new servant for noirtier two women had entered madame de villefort s service in fact everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new faces were presented to the different masters of the house thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family   108.38254038163196
i leave him with you my friend   157.15185244103372
but i tell you that the favor of a minister is ephemeral and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister   175.2294860805335
noirtier closed his eyes   170.42024733753118
the fact is that i do not doubt your eminence s genius will repair the blunders of his agent is that it   38.266598545390806
then in that case i shall always choose to remain there   71.15602292016146
he told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken   141.72770655596915
then this young man escaped with you   83.98945437690305
this was a blow with her fan applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces   108.65917733929642
well i shall see him to morrow and tell him about you   104.46428926807354
athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street   120.73481915079324
because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months i have given m   30.731964393986388
accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following   123.66159728035744
but how long might this exile last   123.87892475764382
we hear from yanina chapter 79   49.471750423026776
it was she whom he sought   200.77801669203137
it seems to me that it is neither your majesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission   78.26783348264368
plague on t i will guard the king and porthos shall guard the cardinal   67.60974232046902
the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands   116.90369497944722
deposited with the justice   56.40883537860537
the secret entrance was open   183.57760385052555
i do not know who could if i could not said caderousse   125.31608042379463
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered i am i am and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it   156.63937734331046
continue and say what we must do now   15.664102380060285
this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it   99.1283951953727
you understand then comte de la fere you understand chevalier d herblay that i am altogether and always at your service   168.33545901276213
here he said here is a draft at sight   132.25298031496772
with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details   95.72051130206997
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room   110.28257163124769
i know it well so take grimaud   122.08029719805535
valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of every day life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body   179.41622305516051
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left   152.7566580639466
repeated porthos and aramis   85.52733554281045
a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return   80.0973190369329
oh i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise   88.84445266470578
how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir   204.20441730528444
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur   134.62639630449567
where are we to go my lord   67.53675890702385
franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex   79.53393733912185
let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digestion   181.72745129290305
you must stop at the little village of eccuis in which there is but one tavern the shield of france   145.88339355785686
come come tréville hold your tongue said the king   47.24006386851019
this sight reassured him   151.97316455629914
but whom are you seeking debray   126.30566936328027
i ve a great desire to drink the king s health said athos   147.1959812753248
by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we are   80.46604724324163
well do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds   151.32089203224962
therefore when i cough stretch out your arm   104.27248022121981
an hour after the vehicle was at the door   172.62238630706628
dantès is my friend and i won t have him ill used   67.37545383537599
a groom was rubbing them down   192.4926137997579
raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty   116.17489493649998
i used all my influence with one of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to one of the galleries   119.60279066477551
the queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her   157.8696071438035
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m   152.22430583362723
he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable and when the fourth begins takes his departure   126.3198873667529
jackson said he go instantly to the lord chancellor and tell him that i charge him with the execution of these orders   182.20251821642518
bertuccio said he   30.136874764053715
you told me to give them to him   97.40199790458901
wait a little   87.36037831823843
the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt   67.26247709508965
his natural prudence however never forsook him for a single instant   129.77552654860227
i think i have some clew   214.81871871139236
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box   109.56138998776666
and afterwards the road to châtillon   47.18624054657154
my dear albert said debray what you tell us is so extraordinary   190.4924981218779
they hang behead and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible manner   89.7867553979687
he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him   73.03490217376357
said franz reseating himself   189.78290187262562
possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately   92.71573268119985
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life   56.32322957403409
peppino at the same time that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou a man travelling post on the road from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente   82.40485597787486
good enough   87.00339881770346
but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home   127.16020366142462
it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it   70.72043386346695
i would realize how would you realize   126.83480998133552
but you have been silent for twenty years sir   133.37697784583233
i would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my father s chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the cemetery des innocents   134.89736037879493
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody   112.76919638312143
come this is no longer our home   101.0820206270109
their officers wish to see you sir   11.030299836608776
it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them   72.39367060404581
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her again   55.50756444724465
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men   169.14270361270547
but they may come any moment for you left word that i awaited them   186.20995621010138
ah this time cried d artagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me   65.35748644790877
monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face   72.00636995224895
and the guardsman   71.92597516460751
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction   180.84014646874536
yes but it is too late said danglars i have honored their bills   184.86478000424034
the guards were under arms and d artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades   152.23160606860762
and you aramis are you of that opinion   150.1574239112669
and what sort of revenge would you take   216.87643332329694
what is the king doing   49.1188019544024
asked the man in the cloak   102.90679456061996
two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital   166.19300792738056
the countenance of poor ali recovered its serenity   81.5964030386539
my faith yes said athos   118.98496279113552
it is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation   183.8954400342958
to the sword sir   45.156344813026095
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away   111.12831750126166
milady was not deceived   131.05052735309246
you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle   118.75003454248439
he threw himself upon it and fell asleep   111.56704565312752
was that affair hot   80.18583239844983
tis you then my dear count cried gondy offering his hand   113.14604625676114
but of what sort   164.46640089831638
you hear me at a quarter past midnight in fact in twenty minutes   119.47901984842194
ah grandmamma murmured valentine pressing her lips on the burning brow do you wish to kill me   137.0553594866819
at his country house   110.66744625205865
take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad   109.25357549591797
eustache church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling   21.848272204374524
to sleep after the manner i speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation i know the famous hashish   202.44370578704115
you shall shut the door that you may be certain i contemplate no injury to you   108.3362323922531
the lady with the red cushion produced a great effect for she was very handsome upon the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded   111.09983924572288
that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought   149.0500757816701
directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut   26.035964520747882
the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me   108.9110664825476
dantès was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left shoulder   88.57028324503115
to tell you all i know was the reply   122.64554986296204
30101m this time at least i do not deserve your thanks   117.5493276835468
i hold this serpent in my hands   160.77840177826045
oh things take their course without our assistance   53.96480064244567
besides even you didn t recognize me   48.65120929375644
lord winter   167.13037063064405
we are carrying port wine to anvers   72.29952041727701
still i found nothing nothing the chest was no longer there   127.63283768380046
my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons   144.6955803243455
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping   126.01226911904982
after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth   115.10203020177725
seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death   147.03823531148367
yes sir answered athos agitated   153.60280432908766
well this is what you have to say said d artagnan my lord your sister in law is an infamous woman who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth   78.49046532531122
something must have happened   65.21767944811072
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory   179.18686888907942
the evening of the 3rd   73.34240138602655
no the coachman ali and baptistin will go   128.3640361991753
pooh said caderousse   64.62383336507263
how lovely the blue heavens and star enameled sky   94.57285048712477
then you have nothing more to do here   175.74027828433816
and she looked at d artagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away   138.46072982714014
sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father   62.58457606260209
can we have the honor of seeing his highness   130.66161938161784
but porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as d artagnan   195.26796804733664
if he demands my daughter let him fix the day declare his conditions   84.43556996589943
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket   121.26691814439368
there there said la carconte   116.59181049250168
but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction   153.59479641572196
blaisois seeing bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and christian charity   126.6048910686005
answered the cavalier   92.67058498463055
nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud   152.3096433566887
i don t know anything about that replied renée   82.06136442723164
de monte cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject   188.2191148674514
and you failed   166.92911419013512
well what do you see from this window   96.9736575486804
i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing   148.62042606705535
d artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place   149.06906509435754
but god our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us   97.25370430258046
well sir what you tell me is impossible   116.84719697174508
friend said he for athos this is too much   150.169797729219
this valet whose name was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of papers and in the other a packet of letters which he gave to albert   83.21002631490356
there was a moment of frozen silence between these two   113.77714886250786
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin   69.68158606027234
albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness   114.72433084303027
content with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and re   80.05812215625642
the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents   66.19495645721011
i assure you franz and i were lost in admiration   124.26134996234047
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview   96.97817433817808
in the house in which the judicial inquiry was made continued the impassive cardinal there lodges i believe a young béarnais a friend of the musketeer   151.13775952897365
the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity   176.09283584246762
added porthos   159.8949841652752
by my faith nor do i remember it either   98.79269597990282
no the son s   137.40408337285962
yes sire as they always do   62.74515271296475
bonacieux he will rouse the whole quarter   83.55194000012555
you are right sir and no one can doubt my position   167.41378551297973
but i have judges quite ready who will quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide a bigamist into the bed of lord de winter my brother   32.21485097526234
your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for   190.53232219114648
exclaimed mousqueton   24.108067620644846
not morcerf   136.8769482521594
d artagnan slipped into the wardrobe   177.58425248358932
we have a fixed price for all our provisions   75.83684706112163
yes i fear   31.10276244035576
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer   147.8425609227629
do not conceal anything however serious let us see the island of elba is a volcano and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling war bella horrida bella   213.83058687294633
i was going to tell you   82.51802038131407
some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight years ago and i have forgotten them   168.6598363659076
at these words she passed her arm under that of d artagnan and urged him forward eagerly   166.95866523479336
every one arose   181.86829834647554
he is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in france   195.90687153445725
that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercy s for pity s sake   131.32058619307347
three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities   67.04223272228145
in short groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception   146.86661841603058
maximilian you know i have no relation in the world   174.46062983328875
it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as d artagnan appeared before even he had asked if milady were visible one of them ran to announce him   123.89859386733511
hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmore s opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum a precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine   110.54000334288186
and besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do   148.58201630793144
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him   172.45156029675337
from the top of an eminence d artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur   124.69103577477306
gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg   127.78608453728748
answered the boy the thing is done   123.3287603410681
tomorrow you will go   117.67743197689856
and do you feel sure of succeeding   174.83671374900257
and that is all a prisoner can wish for   99.91287993712577
she would invoke the past recall old recollections   81.89093909318615
as for planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush   46.91825826403489
our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever   54.55020224542605
this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage   144.68999999776378
i may go where i please   116.1616715260253
what shall i do   143.0046942147064
but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers   149.71927630908976
i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine   44.104799545009456
you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about this   140.58251724362017
no my lord duke replied la ramee in the fullness of his heart   163.14013664332202
by no means replied the young lady quickly   116.81861123952471
he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady her first attempts after her arrival   113.79328016991373
and porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as d artagnan had so often done formerly   149.62051477473074
we will save your soul said the young man   49.130127922654026
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old   61.7108280916864
she had laid that down the preceding evening   41.93857582756375
no one would have thought in looking at this old weather beaten floral decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things if in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with it had also a voice   103.1231279895668
then why do you apply to me   73.855071436289
yes he is a terrible antagonist   148.4260924675267
a fanatic has just assassinated him   22.172082263489372
thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and i must return to beaucaire my wife will be getting uneasy   52.56948851661
they saw monsieur de vendome that is to say the son of henry iv   64.99100821250775
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother   6.491502809840426
you are almost a boy   155.6164545155803
diplomat or not i don t know   104.08502557228331
he went to find aramis   115.39195327637464
you mistrust me then said dantès   92.39700122833347
as you wish then   77.16366086394397
a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello   166.39434549245652
there is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet   120.13373712786805
tis a comfort said the gascon since we shall not die of thirst   169.1835753984368
rochefort and d artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips   54.123759083900026
buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into france as an ambassador   205.545532737938
de tréville thought it best to be first in making the complaint   94.2248744175597
can you see what they are doing   89.57184307298249
madame and i were there two years ago   109.12997580452961
and then continued mme   67.78037709892416
mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the minister s proposal seriously   66.60373407439602
on his return to the cathedral d artagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the sacristan   68.8532667403277
porthos made a most significant grimace   73.08347714479703
felton uttered a groan   197.76303892132742
do you wish for a proof   188.20886551155863
it is you who have been his mistress madame   44.171378883883975
midnight struck   135.89166258423126
here said he to him are the diamond studs that you came to bring   145.4569449438071
has he eaten anything lately   169.4992422108834
was he so sweet then   54.51779325483903
why did you not say all this before you took action sir   62.28385082249764
but others wish that you should go there   138.46274286266944
where my god   179.65560559676504
for my part i ate but little   81.14842905763535
good night my friends   123.04158013464296
a town house and a country house   75.39812035925031
i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet   57.953329362073134
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole   162.63025792506164
she is under the big chestnut tree replied the spoiled brat as he gave in spite of his mother s commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare   132.490391596448
the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice   75.00136506916162
i will go straight to the louvre   156.9077829631444
imagine my astonishment continued milady when i found myself face to face with this woman   165.21913426067752
on no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although i during his absence watched in his place   163.47689759412395
he was inquired after but no one had seen him   157.4005483612685
at vincennes tis true one lives faster my lord replied la ramee my lord or dies sooner for it comes to the same thing   81.70256796916053
athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress   107.0757997999645
not even to athos or porthos   179.71797815285936
i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political   42.06794225721424
i did my best to make them drunk   68.45580556610082
open the door i beg of you   49.55839841835554
he is scarcely five feet high   142.36376383632066
the count fancied that he was yielding and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the château d if   76.18907327500298
good lord how cold i am   132.3417632282711
i told you i did not wish to be behind my time   78.22432163541119
the friends embraced   110.9438040092248
again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages   189.3084860180595
but i must make you see this time that it is too late to retreat   137.11078562532074
morrel and then ran on to mercédès   98.07135382734296
but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous   116.01266238426032
it is woman who has ruined us still ruins us and will ruin us as long as the world stands   73.26634935824875
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned   151.03671469376457
no my guardian replied raoul blushing   94.30443960054473
that is best said the king   146.91205650927313
you knew him   112.29271751553193
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it   75.18580309794976
what is the matter dear grandfather   123.85362690233836
and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you d artagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter   74.18692534119188
brunhilda and fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its infancy when man was learning to control mind were it even by an emissary from the realms of darkness   112.91731686024134
nobody but i know it   42.55709935831233
i ascended into the red room and waited for night   215.96273010816938
do you take any interest in politics   119.20862335143109
but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth   68.83756100253166
madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well done   116.50634621975169
the queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed her   106.50460158603397
bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each   164.3756078833154
yes monsieur quite ready said bazin   149.9180395228962
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos   55.403581698677996
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously   112.3045546684853
and the coxcomb arrested de beaufort and banished madame de chevreuse   133.73742632627523
but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted   100.83274085951328
said d artagnan we can t be overtaken   122.20200314961643
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair   120.84781974701077
bonacieux had also reflected   118.12622405357045
de tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline   47.69586341975837
i have not yet had time to see him again   140.89890143066668
oh i do not mean her fortune only   144.2649280219157
italy seems fated to misfortune   71.83041093637098
incendiary   119.49911361201653
d épinay and his family   63.211089906600975
five hundred paces   162.7214103893685
flying through an army sire said athos in all countries in the world is called charging   16.058852170587002
my father is king s attorney replied andrea calmly   164.57357201091554
go to go to   49.87876995885868
selim selim   141.3590511900213
but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye   15.969510363074662
an ironical smile passed over albert s lips   161.19196466374655
the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind   93.00761531467336
no fifteen thousand are not enough i can not again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs   57.625805987867
spanish policy and austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the louvre where they had as yet but partisans   82.14601407160478
and so in spite of m   174.658572627987
morbleu monsieur   133.06528552251672
when do you propose going thither   152.0127137294828
you said then by the word of bonacieux   92.88319137313138
later said athos   69.65446027984855
but when i reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman   96.4032021735204
after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither grimaud had preceded them   151.63592244172483
dunce cried milady dunce   45.00180652220182
they were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and i asked no questions   170.6020084213403
but i know he must be so at present   121.21225624870863
god preserve me from another such hour as i have just passed   60.194217924450314
and thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us all   110.68442513534966
i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request   155.9968110708341
then bring some wine said d artagnan   151.79223298433703
yes he said yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for life   140.14310587471857
why upon my soul my dear fellow it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock jobber who has speculated in the fall of the spanish funds or some prince travelling incog   104.1922514620221
it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven   119.52804026841525
well i too could keep a servant   107.41478654775798
i deliver them to you without compulsion   151.73221814700221
oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hair oh who will deliver me from this man   160.79575928685227
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth   137.00267014405455
why it was he who carried me off   132.6556439251522
you yourself presented him to us   103.92492794017849
d artagnan retired to bed not to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening   154.7977534515169
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other abbés   104.30181194695419
in his pride he fancied that every one must know the chateau du vallon   55.82604976235322
oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money   109.69660725709646
nobody knows who she is or where she comes from   155.01988748246242
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice   124.6808660999591
come barrois said the young girl take some of this lemonade   133.42179022041776
upon my soul i am ready to die for your majesty   127.87669487696492
what is to be said   83.57019873138688
there s something promising said d artagnan   116.6911362984816
when you eat use every precaution   86.64726435947945
in fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the louvre no one appeared to be aware that charles i   89.73808629291011
as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought   188.97810578105526
then as i said before sir very well   97.53446811670827
the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain   78.98990629429375
this is all very easy for you to say replied d artagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him   132.06439668016924
de tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might   77.68084123334245
then he fixed his eyes on mercédès   33.60877163451336
he arrived   92.85790196796958
be civil or i shall beat you   135.26518766435046
but happily for you you serve an all powerful master   174.61685813277478
thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are addressed   132.1758022464643
go and tell him the ring is his d artagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with you   152.78091893228756
you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because there is no prison   75.45915914725698
to which of us   182.8393223711783
to day aramis and i are beaten in our turn   151.45239163732901
the third in the gardens of amiens   158.7013017565248
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that   133.4551512030271
d artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying let us go   101.30373667999268
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir   145.50978078756077
i am going sir   82.58518799085708
and i said athos am returning to bragelonne   77.09023406499429
how long must you have served to claim the pension   110.83225711252398
were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were afraid   182.54682376971135
come said the captain we have done all in our power and m   192.47274092151133
d avrigny who ran to valentine and raised her in his arms   67.85276091797928
the moon would not rise till midnight   173.14644393436294
progress of cavalcanti the younger chapter 77   52.6177080440795
nearer nearer still   97.96937868491116
20063m my dear friends said morrel if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven   130.0688113954262
to the bar publicly cried   73.5931024960638
in all probability he has replied the valet for i saw the horses harnessed to his eminence s carriage this morning and when i asked where he was going they told me to st   76.61316263739954
d artagnan thought this could not last long and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears   108.3156874249337
how he had returned   84.58100024032804
instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this time with a solution of salts having their basis in strychnine strychnos colubrina as the learned term it   75.58518349821875
mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole   108.79395282624954
why does not god if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether   63.30187785400094
a don quixote without his corselet without his coat of mail without his cuisses   82.17018680689648
during this brief altercation athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said madame princes who by nature are above other men receive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes   107.09487226034393
he did as he said   165.61852568089247
can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities   196.29695725951578
this moment sir   108.08440097822665
this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum   111.49467810701256
come come my little fellow don t be angry   136.48342740657222
often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of monsieur de beaufort   125.22977368969758
there are yet five days left   134.58426302796977
when will your majesty deign to receive him   166.19218206172462
accept it my lord accept it said aramis   136.89713123598102
it will be well to prepare a light supper of which you athos and aramis are not to partake athos because i told him you had a fever   96.47834529408257
yes if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief   75.96823346653778
he came twice to milady s   80.68597125189842
just then the count felt his arm pressed   98.01943764709439
my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched   105.0579136367121
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us   67.45121867367735
she tried to be agreeable and she was charming winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole personality   173.10991363794184
i come to you my leader my head my father and i ask you master are you contented with me   207.91152455157015
chapter 59   93.51594815330498
this evening m   151.60027863696942
but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized captain groslow   81.75930197594718
ah now i think of it the count of monte cristo can not appear in the hall said beauchamp   131.2346279992164
but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion   53.802666989398915
the man in the red cloak the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man   128.34007040056446
i offer you a beggar my lord   68.477295701969
he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished   156.4610701852965
and you what have you done monsieur porthos   91.34557939598344
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword   22.408744684368415
his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted   52.40657757686974
into what room did you take him   127.36449818361395
and on my word he would be bad company in going either to heaven or to hell   171.96345838461482
said the novice   166.4270056226099
dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion   156.94982105029197
in fact said franz this horrible scene has passed away like a dream   121.29976426590335
the thing is so curious i will make the experiment myself   121.68576151854882
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness   85.81457716396797
come hither   68.84099670329486
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention   83.4493983283061
d artagnan then looked around attentively   51.51277917151098
that m   114.74500508074875
upon my word   110.00906462330303
but some of these like clever rogues have contrived to escape human justice and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems   146.5308823662931
your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak   150.14224652083624
when i hear misfortunes named madame he said i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i can not help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind   183.00204642299138
well she is a monster who at twenty five years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals   187.6124384553209
said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter   85.56207183189129
i repeat to you however and this time on my word of honor i think perhaps too often that i am in haste great haste   168.72846670991035
a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect   81.28967594225325
you will come with me then maximilian   130.49917263958136
i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion   99.88701266308905
those with whom i will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners mount my horses and exhaust my fortune   50.12089468119687
i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home   129.2971694991585
where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese   89.17983107755592
now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property   117.06274729852585
aramis he continued was intimate with a young needlewoman from tours a cousin of his named marie michon   70.75233002250991
that person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect   61.27179144193684
life is full of humiliations and sorrows continued he becoming still more melancholy   114.75654430364442
in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow   144.64097728727407
the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in heart free in mind into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie   90.47911037137773
and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor   110.01394163964865
debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the minister and besides albert looked at his tablets it is the hour i told the count 21st may at half past ten   217.97119613069344
there he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting anne of austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a title   120.77779227106001
well blacas what think you of this   62.187605380474025
besides bazin is ambitious and learned   150.12716546075467
then what would happen   250.7864672538761
will your excellency visit saint peter s   157.93230018331963
put in porthos   176.08913292098123
accept my thanks for the client you have sent me   97.93590979974982
then you are going with me   80.638418403775
perhaps she has spoken to the pharaon and brings you some tidings of her   130.70368695531843
monte cristo was not deceived   180.35461882739196
twenty five   222.3813017756312
the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible   202.2390701967526
i have eaten nothing   139.49396158879955
there is no occasion to make such a fuss since i give myself up   132.20296453020325
if i were sole owner we d shake hands on it now my dear dantès and call it settled   101.19888751788815
four men carried me from paris to châlons walking six leagues a day   150.60907678146106
the black horses of the musketeers their martial carriage with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier would have betrayed the most strict incognito   165.3434387271397
what can have become of her then   53.15252616872078
after nine at night pardieu   82.8477816250916
now monsieur de vallon said mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country   84.5347592387333
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort   140.64110587197558
from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the fête exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight   113.02622796244785
you will help me to recover my spirits   63.26153265200461
and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward   162.83948301896203
the day was employed in preparations for the execution   49.40066057517733
said the musketeers   156.58735642603784
you particularly wish it   63.77912442701751
not quite twenty six   7.6440208988042
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp   73.07255508935002
we are dying of hunger   159.28513571043595
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow   106.03854199286985
i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone   175.66697270237768
do you know about that institution   97.75226207718572
an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wall all was silent there   150.15564751612544
why should i stand in a comrade s way   55.0228644792332
said d artagnan deeply piqued   97.97444589665398
as to d artagnan he will go by what route he thinks is best in planchet s clothes while planchet will follow us like d artagnan in the uniform of the guards   155.26290585704808
still he had patience for another half hour which appeared to him like a century   177.56205692567383

thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply   124.39165776493239
the old man s eyes remained fixed on the door   164.3659338644322
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle   115.17947526343961
what without chastising this insolent boy   162.94191794985727

on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall oh god   80.16739751710108
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that d artagnan had not come to béthune   101.43914495774082

yes monsieur the handsomest in the inn a chamber that i could have let ten times over   185.2575939821328
and athos set forward toward charenton followed closely by aramis   128.5041232941542
we can not leave you here so and yet we can not stay   96.37990795564292
heaven grant that this light prove not a devouring fire   56.34271151797614
exclaimed mercédès if it were so if i possessed free will but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair   203.4842519244605
cavalcanti moved a step forward and albert turned towards him   44.1694526404718
do what i tell you and immortality awaits you   119.59847202438355
will you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire   139.60657633951772
excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient   172.00038657801946
do you live in this way always   80.90634507670609
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it   113.34591152242375
in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse   94.48770424715752
you say you have nothing to do with my cash box   127.34822678327127
madame de saint méran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament   169.54584560360806
i beg your excellency s pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the roman dialect but i don t think i m many minutes after my time ten o clock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran   175.0819033607233
the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators   174.17541939332918
i think so indeed cried he   31.434074775568774
de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation   123.64946150681033
d artagnan unfolded the paper   157.14565664911436
the history is ended   103.82230714934587
bonacieux lived on very quietly wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife and caring very little about it   34.66406220207402
then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus   170.6869537899625
mousqueton recognizing the voice of his master s friend got up suddenly and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night   90.94267440697452
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal   95.83430380846711
let me see him   94.24244935382363
this man had been four years longer than himself in prison   57.612880418740986
from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues   183.6784089314968
it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so cheerful   123.48941208681777
from what he has told me i know you now   161.40980959343196
i shall die of it   10.834941265113642
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said   109.99045614013691
signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two   172.66228980282122
monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies   69.35501410949044
why it was he who spoke to me sir said dantès with a smile   118.95662362298204
i could never get such a man as that   82.08446413078791
they both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants   166.65232988867402
and here is mr   113.73095479653956
this news was brought to us   26.300225398748324
d artagnan wrote the child s name in his tablets   130.5073835161594
you admit that you would fight then   132.30996124397618
but upon one condition   182.84290301521992
at first the captain had received dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust   179.7157144624975
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tréville   87.51940250500544
during twenty he had been lieutenant their captain since the night before   130.78018773109977
a woman s letter monseigneur   75.33334523376354
listen to me sir   24.377062689925594
gentlemen i am young scarcely twenty three years old   117.20404719166655
well monsieur   117.28630002710906
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer   78.82188716592248
a certain monsieur grimaud my lord   121.24233459008768
at what time   75.02256111797215
yes signed the old man   158.4163277542287
in a handsome running hand   91.70647681176473
here they are and 200 more besides   155.57088506815802
locusta chapter 102   192.88635843007796
and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one   115.6805783046451
there is a way of detecting its presence   139.47381995287174
cried she throwing back her veil yours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten   164.73893214090015
or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police   60.419722322006834
well monsieur has only to take the right hand staircase in the courtyard and knock at number five on the second floor   67.13980571637497
he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me   74.632003773669
the imprudent young man expected a surprise mixed with shame a slight storm which would resolve itself into tears   106.19217112763424
the moment the little troop passed goskal and were approaching the post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his lips   135.46101623038018
well i will go and take a turn in the champs élysées and at ten o clock i will return here   182.04545741371854
the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently   132.78710502453072
he is really king of paris   106.9285311555869
you have never seen our africans count   80.19688130085086
this arm is paralyzed   104.05698951414118
why you told me he was a young man   88.84831161636329
and the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of lord leven   105.45344990185522
it s nothing it s nothing   172.5930405519846
or spent the money   129.49795004340334
the deputies bowed and left the room   95.57126867529358
bernouin alone knew a little more than the others   175.41076935043782
you fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you   177.98425321982577
ah perbacco indispensable were they   102.15725166641262
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee valentine it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin   81.59487249476379
that has weakened my purse   159.23830062706315
then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart   107.22979884297773
well then three months said penelon   151.9401687139782
no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master   67.5977420372557
during our expedition to béthune the husband of my duchess died   149.92758968748467
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis   122.457293490541
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise   151.00151418583962
the face of the commissary grew still darker   187.63234280247985
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears   191.8370540249536
as for me i feel anxious to preach a sermon said d artagnan   166.52731274291432
near the camp you might be recognized   180.2128701504618
he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die   199.89623044144304
certainly said d artagnan   87.89201125743361
the sheath at his belt was empty   98.31221888782576
alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff behind   125.37432570989913
between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged   182.54511165202263
yes madame the comte de la fere   201.906366795478
asked la ramee giving more serious attention to the duke s words   133.98262042774513
oh leave me   107.36322371916738
but monsieur it is very natural returned bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished   98.31422027953032
i don t see that at all answered porthos   67.05008808662947
the captain of the musketeers was therefore admired feared and loved   35.23412820554107
i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles   154.6324771460258
that is our brave musketeer i think said the cardinal   135.03970548671742
it is your new master my good fellow said the footman   145.7367684084158
he meditates   100.81690669586202
and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england   115.03799080111652
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pasha s misfortunes   67.0137002251907
you at last   68.36907057524584
this did not take long   94.31092251380193
in ten minutes it would strike seven   151.99931287852954
then i shall say the duel did not take place   131.36959028884394
i think it will be wise to set off said d artagnan   99.5629657366941
i believe her to be a cardinalist   81.82596723068104
athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the king s tent   56.347173122650155
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory   108.59852474538361
i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own   33.903468662710026
porthos could hardly keep his countenance   79.0120351857181
that is admirable   152.2748999864444
replied bonacieux in a sepulchral tone   175.36468951673595
i want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you   64.89347528824274
he began to laugh i threatened to strike him and he made two steps backwards   137.56476245420978
excuse curiosity but i wish to be enlightened on the subject   110.3971241666876
the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help   131.8635151953838
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude   130.9678363395192
what i have always wished for desired and coveted is the life of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself   69.78052479497205
return instantly   97.6489102755702
it would ruin me replied the abbé   174.24671328100032
i should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination   152.89569580290592
while d artagnan turned the two horses into a lane went round the house and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts   60.90422016645757
a gentleman   8.718021150895751
does the house approve that the examination should take place today   196.4207024697435
in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody   101.41110990777399
the religion i serve the god i adore were blasphemed because i called upon that religion and that god but still i resisted   142.13530661774195
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours   146.26881430264024
he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore m   90.72040981746106
but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to paris so that if the messengers and the spies had failed his eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed   140.26975314267668
at this moment the clock struck eleven   66.49323776628208
well sir returned mazarin prudence is a fine thing but to day you might regret having been too prudent   75.32357401969314
oh woe to me   34.51360664639441
but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short   116.87738254564658
besides we are sent here by cardinal mazarin and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal and are therefore as ambassadors able to act with impunity a thing that general oliver cromwell who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general is quite the man to understand   122.27062522294987
howled milady   11.133789223045355
however he continued to take the left hand   149.46939868746404
you know how i settled the matter   46.87496757651836
his opinion has been given   105.52199421372069
ah well   132.98040001597622
he dismounted and entered   201.91276922997082
the same smile returned   100.01458654374345
he tried says richelieu in his memoirs to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of buckingham to superintend the departure   105.25670614342324
what have you discovered   119.2154914192343
but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour   134.31260231965518
time however passed away   88.1752484581703
i am replied dantès in bad italian a maltese sailor   127.24206591604413
i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber   111.04482407589735
to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another   75.3898476800329
no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond   156.17239466554773
you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form   98.83268154002323
why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better men   92.13725653176661
when quite a child the little vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity   134.44540099708112
d artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on planchet s horse   139.25495110749296
on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand   86.35576380046975
come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they want   69.96559892118799
and la ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill   136.47949226406232
said a swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer glass   150.37041016146617
while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from athos   117.66309753388003
chapter lxiii   5.011085842470834
and who are you   134.3609362150765
3 knocked on the head   162.80518385048586
i dressed myself as quickly as possible   124.61293235872337
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me   214.09251660973985
one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them   98.45334990828681
villefort again groaned with anguish and despair   160.88525874304224
what do you demand   74.97567898299567
you didn t know king charles   161.94968860169246
so let the matter end   116.22665607996258
asked morcerf   141.01465393557936
but what is it   110.62617399542236
and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared   80.06416248796134
but this i know that i had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen hundred   148.9320975744887
for look the sentinels are being reinforced   205.29812291585893
athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy   134.02444018009612
d artagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle   137.63988749817258
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger   141.1222093188155
the hostess replied only by gasps   65.54742146100574
it remains now for us to keep our word   131.5015961050341
these important advantages d artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe   94.29552585796058
said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat   106.22146236706617
well we have time   71.93549291426345
eight days my lord   168.57747597400459
do you know the count of monte cristo   153.46520656289272
richest my dear fellow   32.60244787913355
monte cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it   68.59570164298059
debray lives some distance from here   152.76455992384325
this duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti   93.32160963286186
said lord de winter with apparent good nature   102.99575265701039
to save the king   109.13257629949699
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm then had gone toward aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair   110.28020008590524
let us know when breakfast is ready   179.1100158871208
we will be with you at six o clock my lord   64.0093015657565
i did not come to rome to see said danglars aloud   108.57032716458711
the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture   125.45485290828145
i understand said the duke   96.2783947515267
at that moment d artagnan passed in pursuit of milady   130.72049842472967
yes i see for the young man raoul said d artagnan   121.69109334210052
to be decapitated   77.95397154420068
you have ill understood wrongly interpreted   121.48035041361375
the bastion was guarded   36.913800213944654
i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband   112.7444998293431
their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dantès he was now number 34   141.95832724273163
the young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them   30.5966868127515
the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor   109.41605276240907
he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice   101.3700940501996
let us see what more does athos say   76.3495106205849
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself   151.24728272885764
bravo d artagnan your opinion is mine cried athos besides we must be consistent   74.12120047723747
is it because my opinions differ from yours   49.281896700234725
at the saint gervais bastion said porthos   91.87975281475309
grimaud had indeed during twenty two years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athos s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy   37.70715089640211
i should give up broussel said porthos   169.12471960909357
yes yes murmured cromwell   106.15419994161334
really m   197.30327664459844
if we lay hands on this fortune we may enjoy it without remorse   153.70632557306655
how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i don t know myself   172.69107295630596
ah i see you are smiling   80.92193355137118
cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the hôtel   63.30547801517214
it is important that you should be seen there   136.34166969769805
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape   10.834807846190344
he knew the king of old and he knew that all these complaints were but a preface a sort of excitation to encourage himself and that he had now come to his point at last   130.67188114391755
i shall still have my place   126.95934474012245
when villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said d épinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club that i may at least know who killed my father   42.48946824922989

and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine   165.3820652205695

she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of kitty   192.94626978117293

confound it yes   111.08758659259482
that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly   136.5891847510541
the celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the count s possession   81.43772760496128
monsieur de chatillon cried aramis taking from his saddle bags a second pistol i think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead man   103.11434652148708
d épinay consented to our all living together   88.47013354941788
i have my carriage here said the president   67.39304179122675
more determined than ever   140.80623265082994
an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion   41.784439586839966
you really mean to declare that such is not your intention   99.27539976202495
yes yes said albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our children s children and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to you for had this been known oh beauchamp i should have destroyed myself   103.07259996668188
i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money   64.8890148933592
valentine said she only drank half the glassful   80.58937657177091
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation   121.32725177627695
no monsieur he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body   73.13504515572825
i was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place   94.49647975745557
i recognize you there my brave d artagnan replied athos   101.21929534402058
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play   122.78060736278161
calumnies did you say sir   90.27892143752663
i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him   111.76940198736206
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you   167.00109425305726
the return d artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos   92.38818263648926
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that   32.0566205093733
it is now my turn to dress myself   59.13804683314983
at least we can have a window   69.67582713919813
but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves   143.09929421142192
and where is it decided to transfer him   155.26939513207634
yes and the queen too   168.55288507219745
i heard it with my own ears   34.00090078376043
this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor   97.50279053211447
replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time   75.4148474577406
but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal coffers   119.36515782508854
i have no money to build ships with penelon said the poor owner mournfully so i can not accept your kind offer   125.42627498989565
the company clapped their hands   66.4621004650933
nevertheless you can understand that when 700 000 francs leave the wife s pocket the husband always finds it out   46.26321739969812
most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility www   142.08103530806426
no said noirtier   140.2566769647539
magendie or m   155.67982871424562
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done   114.18543447402025
he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope   85.90486312082531
like a genuine frenchman albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening s diversion   148.23511254395441
again you drive me to despair maximilian said valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound   83.83268474786722
murmured the duke looking at the king and dandré who spoke alternately like virgil s shepherds   109.57807655469861
go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven o clock   106.43645892683932
i have just been with him   146.99982382683697
i am at your service my lord   90.80594106124649
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said   152.28459796949394
now said aramis we know how the matter stands   108.68803331635598
here they are monseigneur   240.17078623853732
i regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information i did   70.24983118060496
you have several lawsuits and no attorney   133.87932025221386
of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite   127.38687647572966
there was the prize given by the jockey club a gold cup you know and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race   64.99028213437634
this precipitation this unusual appointment   126.35736995645149
he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him   137.98215764184627
you are the master and i could not have the least word to say   69.0617652300861
and now farewell   4.235377930140672
will you promise me   129.84914802726033
it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes   132.92312600383147
then i saw that they took me for the assassin   136.37274537928386
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwell s   111.10453518033333
are you not well   124.3947056988337
unfortunately i had not above 1 500   241.21147316650223
certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear   37.006265621422855
oh i assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three   131.05972971410637
this circumstance pleased m   155.89135796213588
he must wait   40.482656317609184
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers   79.9942578905301
i knew very well that they tired out their executioners but i did not believe them so strong against their lovers   150.38384098636917
said porthos and d artagnan at the same time   114.60497804246607
after having failed in poetry monsieur de beaufort tried drawing   151.42725877890126
if i had them i should think myself as rich as croesus   123.4324964160935
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible   7.095406919614561
why does not he go about his business   113.03120664960859
one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal barge near and by its light they examined the weapons   136.28935866082887
so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts   126.19916854738634
the english repulsed foot by foot beaten in all encounters and defeated in the passage of the isle of loie were obliged to re embark leaving on the field of battle two thousand men among whom were five colonels three lieutenant colonels two hundred and fifty captains twenty gentlemen of rank four pieces of cannon and sixty flags which were taken to paris by claude de st   84.20740546578752
you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw   122.68806414045027
at about half past eight o clock they reached the first houses in noisy   77.1945475468608
the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man if those clothes had not been torn to shreds   141.945911148032
for long   120.68326714998733
but the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview   72.36878536287904
afraid of making any inquiries at this house d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras   63.95791292402058
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families   45.28424889030161
yes keep it keep it   141.74383394109586
oh sir what are you proposing   193.10072091624681
i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew   112.85107956813516
he was des roches le masle canon of notre dame who had formerly been valet of a bishop who introduced him to his eminence as a perfectly devout man   110.23681102551912
you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your choice   117.48076029608049
it is of that prisoner that i wish to speak to your grace replied felton   178.1286595095438
arriving at the faubourg st   107.63262789529458
i have at length then intelligence of you   92.48162657858052
caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing   14.95687942843277
thanks monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan emptying his glass that is all i wanted of you   94.67144546376193
it was aramis   83.90894748282743
that s all right my dear aramis take care of yourself said he   130.77175187843545
said athos at the end of ten minutes   113.12633862972673
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner s feverish imagination   130.68342168315812
the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility   94.93151495639452
he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door keepers or the coolness of his colleagues   156.11356050938736
he does not like eugénie sufficiently   110.28600341077254
0097m as he had now arrived at the door of his own house which adjoined the palais de justice he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the spot where villefort had left him   139.351807185321
now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire d angoisse   112.9449986131471
madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife   72.38122535957379
i will go continued maximilian i will seek m   129.99694246674608
they search her   97.3497076380007
he need not sail   157.10658838139426
my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain   170.04891201569697
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brother in law monsieur de tréville is particularly attached to their majesties   126.05530439723225
i had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or musketeers   3.536964384392107
villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities   134.69593079756442
undoubtedly madame said d artagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward   144.84427708682534
that s the place milady s own residence   132.48873173211982
aramis at this movement drew his sword   74.21411533043633
not old cavalcanti   118.23078534147254
the arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events   135.08758784177982
aramis accordingly took the quill reflected for a few moments wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand and then with a voice soft and slow as if each word had been scrupulously weighed he read the following my lord the person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the rue d enfer   44.55206806623603
and brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decanters   106.52596584111132
yes my lord i accept them said d artagnan   155.42501204805876
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister   144.94982559112754
leave me to my death   67.09501857843287
then let him come in if you please   119.69959382146268
except your signature and your partner s m   127.36811664743998
in the anteroom valentine met barrois and looked despairingly at the old servant   54.2658427179042
d avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison   152.22440329401633
saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them   51.84276516695401
but can not one learn philosophy   144.30327208858088
then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he said   137.2161192750127
noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer   172.55815643224517
peppino mounted the seat behind   85.77822095035755
as sterne said   163.97571281982874
but i must return to paris   50.827497122649646
d artagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to general cromwell s health   74.7823903935514
i am not aware of it said albert smiling sorrowfully   85.12006755124793
we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve o clock   61.49833641722013
then replied grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed   154.80492680068443
that he was living on a small estate but where   116.69522226791871
remain said caderousse   48.69379096942011
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make   148.84183276421953
and he touched his mule   90.62729171693498
till tomorrow rash youth said the jesuit   156.8652449196452
he seized monte cristo s hand   83.94152366832176
dantès declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him   175.27431629834948
the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother   158.86191203447356
the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent   166.08489141832462
he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now   132.57234727834228
i am no relation of yours   115.73550493999264
why what can have happened   148.68682323079116
the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy   91.32262154624779
it is providence which punishes him   180.04601285284065
when i go back to france i must suggest some such convenient course to cardinal mazarin and the coadjutor   76.09535620065571
you were the tool of those cowards who dared not kill her themselves   105.07799011175196
do you know monsieur d artagnan   95.7033010696737
stop said albert here he comes   79.2567895429448
and is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman   111.40144520650273
he thought to himself how can i take care of both   94.86444380402754
coquenard they arose slowly from the table folded their napkins more slowly still bowed and retired   111.0309289377816
i will say then monsieur quite short   62.83368242173314
wonderful   136.34582553419497
i have forgotten the other key   177.199805089819
oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count   120.12227356908063
what do you intend doing with me   168.65649113806492
here is night coming on   121.00806451636026
i will not speak again said château renaud   40.02056945813504
i had it   153.50380288019477
you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained   157.60986131717252
he appears cool   85.3510636062586
would i were but a baron   40.19148425762124
said aramis it was only this i had a dream and i related it to her   84.6455916334319
he was at the louvre with his company   173.07291693218502
are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess   71.30665983923251
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me   129.26693493845352
war had made her a queen   142.0011947897554
it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile   120.08494155842261
it is no news to you added d avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her   147.09700110735838
he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him   137.28016106598182
i shall be brought home   57.411421949898156
now the scripture says positively make a sacrifice unto the lord   63.17921628379533
fate is not more powerful than they   132.43760410076032
the host stood at the door   104.76465338129121
speak command i will obey   75.13320824379255
besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape   66.83298510141503
d artagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend   48.32472669306635
the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one   119.17882200205028
no i do not replied monte cristo   143.56325771557732
i will put another case to you continued the count   150.5965264321441
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest   213.41352639347798
you shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission well   123.29708192993756
the last two mounted guard at the door during this examination   76.76248645017509
ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps   116.12987554122124
the white lips no longer quivered the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax   12.055721453583459
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her   173.3540246080338
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room   154.2867044850379
chapter lix   36.14510386972189
on the honor of a rochefort   151.99451776897484
but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen i imagine   101.12850784785255
let the civil war last but one year and i will have a constable s sword gilt for me   89.73198134689467
keep watch from seven to nine   159.4067133356656
at last about ten o clock and just as dantès began to despair steps were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment   102.7596441193743
but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice be tranquil my lord and mazarin became more and more composed   135.0047555081148
did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named dantès   121.11273302958529
and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre   65.53387266880335
d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting   144.7770548068459
his ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them   73.17496993143581
and you too charlotte   142.88034624627488
he spoke of it as a thing already decided   79.1364276809257
waiting below in my carriage   142.4786240567554
signor luigi continued albert is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency   108.31052587914078
the swiss was six feet high d artagnan was hardly more than five   147.43104223677733
well speak if it depends on me   53.17796945155862
before his death had placed in the hands of aramis   38.77724133787261
they would have found they have not found   168.63947173054657
has he then owned all to you   69.63907350921562
the guide was coming   161.90813424567114
it is a forgery   121.36427085746725
it was in this pavilion on the ground floor that d artagnan and porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different temperament   134.02697096749225
you think of starting at once then   82.17231744561734
i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaetano but you questioned me and i have answered   77.61573193784336
as dantès spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of renée who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him   159.90081906959352
without reckoning the value of that diamond he cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to d artagnan which is worth at least ten thousand francs   57.272203673802146
i will watch over them as i have over you   124.84476010438446
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also   70.45495837289897
you too then are unhappy   161.0783407969502
thank you no sir   100.78914080229234
he who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in check   52.467117720566726
the two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything   114.43793366397198
but they believe i am shut up alone here   115.60531533969865
you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling   178.15170515652508
he is bidding you adieu   86.1008072837341
now i am alone my dear athos said d artagnan   100.53018862365506
felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three hebrews in the furnace   142.46743653974977
order four men to conduct them to my lodging   125.63575383912654
do you hear it   88.64442057687289
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices   91.69484873385598
in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure   52.281396838435235
her beauty serves as a bait to her victims   190.00096849958277
this time felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him   190.7334362677347
raoul was seated at table with the count de guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and grimaud presented himself travel stained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner   99.08279227498565
and i du barthois added porthos   66.66114378345148
humph said the major   117.73907944537353
i could live upon a hundred francs   123.71738417032414
is he at liberty   50.41620228873343
and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible   84.43253463025404
i will call thee mouston   135.76446605487558
the coachman stooped down for his orders   70.85997906984376
four times two makes eight then said aramis   120.92209962906662
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop   98.41504900354713
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos   120.8147113419362
oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad   35.311805555881264
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantès where he was   180.08276712858498
i will not continued he after a moment s silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities   170.15626226021345
it is not god s will that they should be accomplished   107.34485178850147
bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the first   146.11479816462287
the young officer however remained mute and motionless   108.72379522096085
having been brought up on the banks of the loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves   61.75870895518989
below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in italian se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere   122.0776861628491
rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner   180.24302446832237
at the third he fell again   129.52109509522006
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king   174.43949203147153
in fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil   150.52344535069523
toward six o clock d artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night   151.98337226000433
i do not know you for one of us   217.0808885184793
because i am not willing to die   195.6008015422347
we have seen plenty of dead men in our time   103.72709461547669
i endured the rain during the day and the cold during the night tolerably well but the third morning my horse died of cold   108.98408905918407
but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will be   78.12656584836145
go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de chatillon   120.80496695427597
reverend sir said caderousse drawing still nearer   45.110763255768944
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot   192.76816185835588
there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe   162.88218267391784
the bodies were not plundered were they   163.8267909968325
i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself   123.318528272837
certainly said peppino   138.34810325967288
i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there   95.25435421703953
the count took out his watch   131.49507788290194
good said he   108.5056001223874
besides i care not for his displeasure   78.51428836880329
have you your sword athos   115.38057129913847
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated   104.3161396376764
do you believe in apparitions   117.25804374449528
she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother in law   94.86638083632627
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me   190.50157673319492
but the animal not liking him as well as debray and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room   159.22831467178594
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself   107.44350135928256
the eyes repeated several times no no no   45.09701356162513
my dear landlady said d artagnan i beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from flanders and whom i am going to take into my service   139.0313499012262
sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house and do not do such things no the commission i ask is quite different   119.32737686594463
i will go by the way of boulogne to clear the way   134.36928498937795
you see i am perfectly composed said albert   79.27267824286409
let us go then said franz since you wish it   43.12758891158981
and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded   93.91694443736218
whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves   124.59682013235866
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but d artagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down to night   134.94350914799497
tell me his name   147.18838495863434
the noise came nearer and nearer   145.6849178427209
but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me   73.21416695258021
the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark   104.82900284624519
no count he replied i am the only victim in this case   133.9226146486849
at this moment barrois entered   141.502936755443
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint méran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after   114.25771275996988
well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends   120.1916467548717
you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the family   26.463997152216137
and what did the doctor answer   165.88804688339258
asked the latter   87.92792653700695
i don t even know their names   156.14917252752463
yes i should expect so   104.26817910891155
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself   38.74240688629932
de la trémouille in whose service he had a relative d artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror   211.1860616598557
very good said the count   139.0735522712381
give it to me then   154.27445049447627
a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m   168.87773764009276
a child who will be of age in four years   59.58004928246335
it was illuminated by lamps with ground glass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoy s weak sight   57.734153909487965
i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to you misfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for you i would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure   67.48786001634971
at the same time the door opened   39.87420454309924
some of your people have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested edmond dantès mate of my vessel   35.241074221977186
and they continued their way crossing the barricades getting the chains about their legs pushed about questioning and questioned   85.60002829066457
why that which dantès left at porto ferrajo   155.99847964201967
well that is perfectly right   117.18883288950079
your majesty probably refers to god said m   103.26453054692152
as for patience you have abundantly proved yours you shall now see me prove mine   99.1358500669442
emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school   109.30165115045789
the same order was followed in returning nor did grimaud s searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the rue guenegaud and of the quai   73.62219563728198
said chatillon   136.38149216048382
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips   116.270233521546
but at the moment he opened his mouth d artagnan who had heard all precipitated himself over the threshold of the door   177.85072749506625
is my mother ill   99.80571957767563
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words   143.42086217552173
i sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators   186.98202780535422
you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me   85.0096048389045
it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it   96.23502662650017
said the king i should not have been rescued   197.44547495893454
shall i see you again soon   106.98145291477556
valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it   78.11343171435053
d artagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense   122.1356554864295
afterward   94.50355389379699
said the swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came   126.37122380199938
la ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience   141.89061588400432
he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by châteauroux clermont ferrand le puy and nîmes   148.5717690405805
said d artagnan raising his sword   92.73094490964841
i know father you are the most honorable man i have ever known   136.13902313299354
albert went to his room and dressed with unusual care   131.3187816068197
besides the eyes of the gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the dark   108.6704011180046
said monte cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilian s face   165.20725646357528
then he said aloud you met him i dare say in the park hunting perhaps   139.54501201934053
in the meantime the king finished his toilet   140.11514434516695
is your excellency really in earnest   10.824300927770437
come said d artagnan let us go   160.2507654334053
who does not love you   128.34992102447632
well grandpapa said valentine kneeling before him and pointing to maximilian i love him and will be only his   149.76011095628323
off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere   58.94217408646228
la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction   179.46947898717622
alone   147.5592312295409
when he saw franz the servant came up to him   98.89758362896171
it is now eleven answered grimaud   144.3591058716532
this concerns your head i warn you   65.961612388552
another way of getting hanged   40.800105922585274
do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought   72.23086073143062
monte cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her cheek   142.88288332914036
nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question nothing only i want it   122.3540598553484
continued the mercer with a trifling alteration in his voice so trifling indeed that d artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man   130.27468430212883
the youth brought a small loaf   132.81338846913582
monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter   106.54820702659906
we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued maximilian   71.89245372359291
the abbé took the note   99.27646215199015
gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through   113.36843855491023
but i was hot headed just as if i had been drinking   108.07457910258599
i wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child   178.93502005944416
we have been in this place nearly eighty three hours   184.89979783237942
besides the conferences implied a truce and to arrest two gentlemen even frondeurs at this time would have been an attack on the rights of the people   145.584333726108
we hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to flanders   136.3123335978528
have i the honor of addressing the abbé busoni   141.2452094254524
a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow   162.29399384017503
let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said franz   141.44262662526842
franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him   120.0074026198831
why did he not tell them his name   43.75115598876907
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes   117.73189386515456
but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea   89.4379371532141
will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight   97.0576757474714
they exclaimed as all rose in bewilderment   75.4209553435442
he approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive away   122.0457510987763
go go i implore you and return hereafter   25.199703169320728
the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him   136.81449936068495
why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag such singers as these don t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others   77.6947730756772
madame say that you would love me then   158.40259599348474
john felton i put faith in your loyalty   105.20797100585229
you have told me as yet but one of them let me hear the other   130.85517500550563
one alone is left to me but he is one of those known i believe to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak   137.74583953698854
a moment gentlemen a moment   144.7203132429663
but at the name of milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents   132.126397836785
but he met here m   151.18546235208655
in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands   37.453928881749675
do you not know him   135.62614979731921
the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace   155.18783007349447
it is true that the indulgence of his foster mother encouraged him   134.13734994568796
said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do   154.25372830014425
this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man who a rather improbable thing had stolen his father s letter from him was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred   117.99781894745857
d artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner   57.15074202195043
they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation   122.28218063492264
it is not fernand mondego s treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you and the almost unheard of miseries which were its consequences   105.55155396273793
oh no was the tranquil response   134.96194046584824
why should i do so   161.92586963224377
i ridiculous   112.46185431157326
asked the host quite cheerful again   149.6689672610346
whenever you please replied the abbé   93.35606892056477
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh   102.73765958353768
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table   121.99823953181564
but will that not excite suspicion sir   94.94916140184576
the day had been burning hot   66.70679519970012
that was proved at the trial since i was only condemned to the galleys   154.2576574099577
cried she clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven   105.01877788140379
at st   115.16200318903321
then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body forever   64.69575377227397
interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone   242.11010661841965
still argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened   190.08456412807055
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot   84.21886302647226
the mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe   151.18591579799025
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open   156.29089385532458
and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide   115.04833984606725
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held   154.89409912545867
peppino put out the torch   140.62543122170007
come then and take a turn with me and i will explain   83.9419614718435
cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too   115.43613459518441
the swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded d artagnan as an intruder   136.21117947789267
and knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and inactive   151.27651937932245
stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary   114.86656931725155
but the accomplice shall become the avenger   180.45722753986746
and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations   125.31696919302993
that cousin of aramis that marie michon that needlewoman notwithstanding her low condition had acquaintances in the highest rank   97.76621508476866
we arrived four or five days ago from the vendomois as you know and we are going to give mazarin something to do   166.52809948796352
as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france   49.76882752760268
this is the mystery said danglars   138.5798477081166
replied mercédès with a mournful smile   77.16926075273159
besides he is an englishman   51.603879037203455
speak to the master madame said felton   152.77646453534007
he perceived château renaud and debray who had just gained the good graces of a sergeant at arms and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before instead of behind him as they ought to have done   136.45885526732897
condescend to listen to me and you shall know all   83.58737277029027
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise   169.63404636341198
yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him   145.654196398536
i look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought   163.75001866400777
i would triumph over her and supplant my rival   63.151061319592245
i am john francis de winter   158.40981859551962
does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin   162.1353674096493
i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you   123.7741940592281
bear witness that we have done all that we could   82.02578106405232
it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv   108.85482644649058
aramis look at that horse   158.00393591919521
this is simple enough said the count   93.00274106395408
you say you fear nothing but death   131.9674523113321
the sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his breast   102.8698823052373
yes among your friends of other times   159.49277037659385
five months after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercédès arms   74.08688844995973
porthos seemed to breathe more freely   121.8357130282369
why replied dantès i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire   95.12479402007506
i am giving them the slip said eugénie   149.14845053979687
besides you owe me some thanks   137.7284884367388
all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows   56.399425519529174
he seated himself upon a log of wood   90.63169394931836
he fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month   152.98692393130315
morrel obeyed   134.09280070843533
yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first   88.10921415832868
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway   103.64208734396392
he has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me   66.45177918370322
i had no intention of fighting to day sir   97.60355250503696
in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is   180.92191023687616
athos looked at his watch   110.46928363429649
de tréville feigning the most profound astonishment   204.34720830538703
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal   129.99180902288748
and embracing his father and nodding to caderousse he left the apartment   107.50867172359557
and now it s all over everything is all right again   41.32083149759009
look at m   105.42775528231911
and this is what i said to my worthy adelmonte   126.6608575370492
because she had been branded continued d artagnan   167.1125898507789
said groslow sighing   144.7617368457544
if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave   79.43329262916293
tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth   100.37171276908984
this night i have had a fearful sleep   124.34727703430715
well yes   94.29998619203664
the king took it with a trembling hand looked for the address which was wanting became very pale opened it slowly then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the king of spain he read it rapidly   93.92306411807185
to the king the queen and to the cardinal   84.8976185802327
signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem   95.97204658099601
what letters were marked on the linen   144.36745710297356
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night   120.05451262515619
it was the will of god that this should happen blessed be his name   54.73925153031556
and now you can understand it all can you not   182.40206557716033
oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur   184.24509994068387
he converted his chamber into an observatory   152.636802120831
my dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk   210.607179712684
we put the helm up to run before the tempest   125.44110227810089
and shall you dine there   69.17990769479323
i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching   84.35055483560667
how could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income   160.4215329047313
and how did he look   75.45094614837214
that is in strict accordance with the spanish character   77.19958637764036
added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder   19.58151619365414
and at the third she expired   96.98665097037448
you were always a merry companion my dear d artagnan he said and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you   118.51796003245778
but wait a minute   118.28711824825963
40248m sir said maximilian you are not perhaps aware that i am m   91.54013701368787
i don t know such a place   80.4667300722926
that will be another thing   60.05087049116443
easels palettes brushes pencils for music had been succeeded by painting   96.89126101552783
emmanuel of this gentleman s visit and maximilian will conduct him to the salon   151.2901608292941
demanded villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hour s time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim   50.84146806678737
the floor of the abbé s cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dantès had witnessed the completion   202.1769250271529
then i have leave   102.77738741313824
there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day   180.31377998269267
we shall wait for you d artagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear him   88.34006746245507
and what was he before he went to vincennes   66.59813222424648
you know the history of the pasha of yanina do you not   53.072689965823834
if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey   95.83563217564434
your orders do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten minutes in half an hour or an hour   171.9552454505274
the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière a street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles   121.43011735475228
faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to dantès who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust this 25th day of april 1498 be   121.38360671075532
i think so also replied albert   154.37813888531764
yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi but of course your reply was only to please me   124.92062628909366
queen   82.96827559212193
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice   84.15352717359892
you have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom i am obliged to live   16.045958679643988
however perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him   98.89994123806929
a draught of wine d artagnan   134.30659205935376
happen to be hungry that s pretty good when i haven t eaten for twenty four hours   135.71038705328007
quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no   70.77506542613644
andrea sighed   111.05254264354306
he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned   84.52449343015988
how did you know about it   163.32816751881035
you hear madame   185.81120099865635
beauchamp for instance   171.30724297945235
they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea   96.54082418984919
it is an old man s caprice   124.36837870964916
then he added aloud yes sir i am hungry very hungry   177.16241386660337
charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected   168.33950862472088
are you mad to talk to me thus   160.31634765907404
but d artagnan made use of the comte de la fere s name and after paying a visit to madame de chevreuse raoul started to rejoin the army   71.78118637385344
but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotedness why i should be a ruined man   110.17628634860161
the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently   106.07105320826616
oh said he is it you captain   136.62490442477264
yes monsieur said d artagnan bowing we have had that honor   103.83013125819272
0111m the boat continued her voyage   142.1153767370933
i confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might   50.78923841866866
as the door opened the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter   177.26314604920677
he saw valentine and his eye brightened   39.44914709351441
i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall think for how do i know to the contrary   262.09872423035125
but no she must not die   123.80222901074688
d artagnan and i   33.67607686659281
what are their names   150.09128899616007
monsieur de beaufort told the guards who took him to vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of escaping   149.28651156820197
i am like nero cupitor impossibilium   84.80303894693574
is that all monseigneur   101.54465839311985
but we will return to my lord duke presently   83.09451843072273
or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personage s past life   87.43944872863055
the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive   210.01857771042623
morrel could not resist this   49.636984647532955
it was you who when this rival had discovered your infamous secret wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins whom you sent in pursuit of him   178.26201565053256
that is the night my lord i answered   103.5235417689846
believe your own eyes   68.9344870113971
aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a dark blue cloak of a military cut   90.52743039306111
someone is coming   176.82728808432833
i have committed no crime   181.3515488287969
she noticed that the young man did not say my father   171.8693699764533
a feeling of faintness came over villefort   82.3940338273386
asked mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance   148.34023781314477
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant   157.92214401569774
deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful   119.22576896129203
in passing before d artagnan he recognized his former master   131.10799702249452
notwithstanding all the pains he took d artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new made friends   100.32213566083232
morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns   168.1018665457981
well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for franz to question him i feared yesterday when i would not promise you anything that you were too late there is not a single carriage to be had that is for the three last days yes returned franz for the very three days it is most needed   118.94003032503875
the old man s eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child   65.66717810401846
shake hands i crave your friendship   99.1330835940551
now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter   131.84063525676981
and he drew nearer to her   178.97072627182828
the three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed   79.09145042774655
however it does not signify   118.59122437101038
quite alone   103.21806204874088
my lord said felton the baron de winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named charlotte backson   122.27188427167229
but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings   16.903431114690036
the rest of the start will rejoin us later   193.48904279982537
could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute   152.14800376928633
why the devil have they any stairs with such windows   193.042271852981
you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the allées de meilhan at marseilles   131.87282222989464
it was a new face   131.0017535827371
but fernand was mistaken   131.37627328745103
come with me my friend said the englishman   121.84457583422989
no said fernand   123.47654226868633
in that case he must either have paid his debts a russian do that   140.12369178612704
after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question   147.98632646717425
de tréville it had disappeared   163.11925265169796
indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault s stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect   177.12821860179912
villefort s first impression was favorable   98.85500890780968
but let us talk of this plot m   66.55507373061918
the prisoner glanced at the windows they were grated   84.64245406999274
the lungs are attacked my friend   29.554976964508754
be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which d artagnan took and shook in his   81.62177420555945
twenty men   130.5007534775125
you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince   155.0950296136965
the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement   156.31949097670767
he found athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find him   166.2534299369694
morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry   163.7438540792492
well then said the gascon take care of yourself for i am not a bad hand at the rapier   47.338980547985145
i mean a young man whom you patronize monsieur de tréville   71.02015764502994
the count s tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul   107.95464746760317
her friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution   114.73979388693392
30259m and if you should hear of anything very scandalous i will communicate it to you   141.51154399476007
d artagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted   57.39668421247799
he will ask you what you want and you will answer by these two words tours and bruxelles   135.5461657713838
and the night or two before his death as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old man s debts and buried him decently   7.544803171666743
at the first words of the count de guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood everything   117.2448368067241
but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning   121.97346738577714
but suppose we all go said d artagnan   94.73268350563643
perhaps not so great as you think porthos   76.64307886167796
he feels the wound though he can not recollect when he received it   67.14741403229435
begone begone   42.148606817163966
i am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness   114.11932812592347
a lost and adored son   201.698912860973
said aramis but you forget the officer   73.47303742107559
and what does it concern then my captivity   85.53665135073265
on the contrary olivain is to stay and i am to go   129.25921199705402
chapter 117   61.768650258722246
confide in me   159.22412598044673
well then come here my dear said d artagnan establishing himself in an easy chair   66.71623267499893
then aloud are you ambitious   127.42695164145334
but he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to la bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemy s movements   92.05967850698126
the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready   97.67881474482562
you promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother   45.083752307289444
by degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will   116.54808269645437
you will be deceived just the same said athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in question   81.61617827671705
this event might have three causes the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majesty s guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a well furnished purse in his pocket   48.95584279281397
well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire   78.92991198208972
the answer to madame s replied kitty all in a tremble   141.64298347219125
a month since he boasted of them   116.98413434906341
i was taken to versailles   84.33155700456584
30279m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life   59.046617480664636
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet   36.77051315650711
you said anne de bueil did you not   126.94721648407071
our position is truly a strange one continued athos laughing   200.4008712852342
se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere   181.9237979120398
you ve missed me cried aramis but i swear to heaven   88.59366521132999
it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband   85.23159326126894
a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of st   78.2885039711202
beauchamp albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own account to apologize for him   132.15900784499237
is it so   67.02896931147261
the young girl smiled   139.71289933304186
and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of d artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling   192.52204559959756
three days ago   126.07481837894863
i had well concerted my plans pursued aramis   121.98542430684196
there was a moment s silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror   24.423708094791607
is monsieur d artagnan there   129.14483093584272
i love to see you thus   102.64074448493857
nevertheless reserve my old room on the fifth story for me   11.377894940676441
approach sir said the cardinal   106.42267811556798
bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar   162.14339610935423
but how can you continue to receive us   150.63013957423217
remain sir he added to aramis who had moved to leave the room   95.31562184685824
continued milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime   149.55247529218002
0207m it does   135.42872819283338
as for the cellar i have searched every part and poor stuff i found   117.0692390556807
the noise became louder   93.24828997979523
is so loyal that he does not suspect treason   166.53297863711737
the gale had given way   52.50619929344643
you understand no more delay   79.4007985958161
d artagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him   155.03128965480917
i think the arm will make up for the sword   91.16713811619967
valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m   3.2679495098689273
i now see my error i acted like a madman in coming in here   60.24341508665362
he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it   194.26199416723475
and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god   96.93336022195905
let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly   75.72625496627649
the cart must be tastefully ornamented   96.31936264723642
go on go on sir replied the king   86.10451366158384
at all events answered d artagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinal s they beat them when they draw their swords   120.15933099592343
he forgot the necessary slowness of navigation   138.64038107357874
come murmured athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please   53.498016657032615
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten   133.499069869055
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of ever blooming shrubs ever ripe fruit and ever lovely virgins   83.12134037781607
the carriage stopped near the meta sudans   143.57893953847613
and stay close to me he added in a low tone   111.55221304401918
as to that no replied athos laughing   97.77786499112881
but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head   106.90636729081542
and with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground d artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier   70.00963171179512
and now said the youths we have done all we can for you   19.32941194159571
the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die   221.32515864153467
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of god s mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my father s tomb   191.80879845170296
i had fixed the embarkation for the twenty fourth   50.47630937971016
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs   110.88534697871869
replied d artagnan you are well named gentlemen   100.93300348664467
the deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of marseilles when one morning his door opened and m   73.9781381277331
i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert   102.40751997717618
mouston breathed a sigh   57.627196549015586
villefort was about to retire but m   77.63890219452153
and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying   56.542603501697464
an ironical smile curled the lip of eugénie   174.15258415137347
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon   52.37687043222243
for iron nerved as you are you must need repose   148.26310295010745
to this athos replied quietly we also have money left for i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs   160.9479850338958
for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth   32.422933788985375
i thought you somewhat corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward   83.67838834594589
the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her again   83.35585491267449
scarcely longer than eight or ten days   59.792860111142105
thanks for those sweet words   131.63397808160389
she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune   219.55628947920198
it is a mercy to let me die for if i live i shall lose my reason and become mad   134.75607718730353
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the other   155.53049197275482
it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant   241.25792734489193
well what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re enter by the porta san giovanni   27.81631557067948
and then our gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with de wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself   161.19170703137567
that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances   141.48998912482142
said the cashier   47.061221359010574
you would have done what i did   70.10539523357068
now try and aid us with the remedy   60.74687456757311
it is not yet too late cried bertuccio eagerly   160.47025227690472
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your excursion   85.11359442252768
at half past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day   107.56169132676922
sleeplessness inflamed my eyes   214.55321574530242
behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first peppino and then andrea   113.51394227988689
what he had done you the honor to remain here   173.07736816074708
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned   177.4927081114671
informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king s countenance m   70.65990003486729
when i no longer require them bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale   109.40729925784167
well read it   63.764163039957914
for three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds without mixing with the marseillaise population intermarrying and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mother country as they have preserved its language   176.74763057177037
but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends   137.71029342393476
we thought it dead   123.88607393224001
you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements   74.9383331259611
take care my worthy host said albert better is a sure enemy to well   208.04872660871442
understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker   111.0942130256533
speak then i am all attention   110.36351273358689
madame will await my return   136.5426205204496
this threat brought no reply   164.60760699552822
do not overwhelm me with happiness cried d artagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him   139.8904970538025
and d artagnan threw the bag upon the table   84.26226732918656
i am going to prove to you that i have not   136.50763843610298
well asked the president what do you say to this letter general   114.50241592841749
bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of béthune with milady her mortal enemy   127.75716886514172
de villefort s and lawyers always give you very bad dinners   106.3548043418704
begone then on your part and i will depart as quickly on mine   58.78147918902533
grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head   181.51267568547829
the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey   59.18637114729414
the king s musketeers are arrested by the guards of the cardinal are they   148.22750495098953
it is a family affair   93.92391152334224
give me then that letter madame   117.39254812012197
my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity   149.19347066552604
you accept this young lady as your interpreter m   136.11911711838218
is this possible count   160.40604330035325
and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes   91.42004036989312
since you are here it is well   101.9425991589589
but what sort of madness was it   72.95445928230717
and he held out his hand to julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count   183.87568723958134
what was the abbé s name   93.87915610120965
at length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom   97.80498784338428
good bye then   206.800338248902
said milady embarrassed i know monsieur de louvigny monsieur de courtivron monsieur de ferussac   133.83189306764874
the traitor   73.580554118474
how fast you go   105.18190915200977
i am a gascon said i only when i succeed   98.78290815717585
and he did tell her so much and so well that the poor girl who asked nothing better than to believe him did believe him   35.79915747209459
it appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers   101.53588220463817
planchet and bazin shall go   191.20325366130305
eugénie concealed louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person   101.48450867236139
and four and twenty hours afterward i will answer for its being carried into execution   94.06472825241292
you are a wonderful man my dear count said aramis   155.0833082116809
humanity in a battle   93.19470456095823
or no my poor mother   70.65481574652142
go said the count deliberately   109.3161705018041
the gendarme smiled   111.32868846414839
yes but let us understand each other returned athos seriously   119.73551786949578
no not at all   167.81749601782403
at the same moment a fearful hurrah   132.59914840164421
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound   67.57598772608463
or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything   85.56866855641442
it is really as if i were prescribing for you   159.07417068835966
i see you at last   240.71264517443456
only he was very pale and trembled slightly   105.08846522370933
never sir replied the jailer never   107.30268430967705
the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve   96.63355287449352
i have related it but once and that was to the abbé busoni   49.75352535731105
i offered you your liberty continued the minister   69.04116539595623
the two friends began to dance around the venerable st   100.84667047319596
thank you morrel   82.47951057854216
if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france   138.5335441978629
a knife was plunged up to the hilt in rita s left breast   67.46237042869228
i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded   54.860327121248815
my study   165.28207655504366
and since you know it there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not very patient so that when they have begged to be excused once were it even for a folly they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done   82.92142753338071
oh nothing   36.99816892500695
that is not a family name   164.09157973625426
i will apprise my mother of my intention and return to you   156.76927143712211
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure   137.2937497266008
you are not a woman said athos coldly and sternly   104.80222287178626
but say out all you think d artagnan for you have not yet done so   131.35544859333413
can he have guessed my errand   100.23275554631871
madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet   223.71591204581327
he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way   83.25220650420795
unlock the door antoine   112.40476077263094
ah said villefort with a startling accent   24.88441831914811
and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour   168.65734809196135
now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast   63.37731980830364
gentlemen in the name of heaven   121.19351252778026
a poet is as good as an abbé   138.1832952551708
besides i must think of my outfit   85.01023299044672
i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me   64.40472934468804
but i think it would be still better said aramis to inform the queen and lord de winter at the same time   113.74958549636617
a rich englishman continued the abbé who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value   104.67101905104194
penelon replied julie go and inform m   158.77511961043876
it is only a loss of money which i have sustained nothing worth mentioning i assure you   162.64441209679933
go and see   220.93151679579364
and why then have they not laid hands on him   116.52877408390151
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold   112.50729252457981
cried danglars   135.06149393774638
and because i am only twenty   39.834942256196484
just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics   116.73979853570121
why do you wish to know   109.34697925485533
listen morrel and pay attention to what i am about to tell you   72.85504282978351
that is the cause for which she was branded   142.77402791069653
but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return   77.98193038697279
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the king s visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens   148.15882136631112
50   147.3372167705026
no it will all go well   77.20691370982684
our cargo was to be landed in the gulf of lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829   123.44201231603522
madame danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts   154.8559878262962
but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers   94.54482559134246
parisians and frondeurs as they were the two friends expected to find the same misery the same fears the same intrigue in the enemy s camp   176.47265527358374
put it up again my friend said d artagnan   86.44684812590154
and aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him   80.02042850678882
take them to yonder shed my friend said aramis pointing to a low building on the plain   71.3893506248934
bonacieux having left his house at seven o clock in the evening to go to the louvre never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs   43.919691432357695
cornélie obeyed and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to debray   97.11669867606561
he even turned inside the bevel of the magnificent diamond ring the brilliancy of which drew every eye upon his hand which indeed was white and handsome   131.31497102060908
here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs   147.12323348585844
noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron d épinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel   158.46708516803272
milady does not know me   158.15815270818658
albert albert said madame de morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying   65.05522589026984
oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes never   115.01971884074054
the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning the subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever   108.88404503050793
and morbleu why do you not go yourself   128.3715807933357
having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmond s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish   46.373878196572136
when i am convinced that the statement is false   37.5266308973857
the door groaned upon its hinges   93.03379602003596
d artagnan therefore returned to the rue férou   118.7356349750983
you were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable   65.65770619760937
athos did not leave his chamber   73.13452269165239
may i ask what that was   122.03543612050346
she seemed however by certain signs to recognize a door and approaching that door and now monsieur said she it is here i have business   141.49459304325845
a hundred leagues   156.61486510443694
do not give yourself the trouble my lord said d artagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are   36.472735861188426
a good mother can not depart without her son   136.21095403578437
the third attack now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbé s meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to dantès all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a man could do in these days to his friends   100.30246100552262
is m   71.74406520724057
i have an order to give you   105.50412850336
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me   79.14240766387002
the continual silence of the spot oppressed her   104.90615694965247
this is all very strange said m   31.803275032433135
unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him   160.1738044773368
philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials   103.97070750261965
has he not seen monsieur d artagnan at my house   73.05005224184751
king s musketeers said athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so   160.71102473095033
the prisoner was led away   165.7324293966845
so this gentleman is an academician   70.01340194816152
he turned and saw julie   159.8699837810625
said athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing grimaud with his flaming look   141.44678813795903
50275m oh thank me again   143.32509371099985
and he went out   49.47980700708503
you permit me to tell you that i do that is already more happiness than i dared to hope   179.9088005293114
bernouin shut the door and went away   33.99618596318916
the will chapter 60   107.12568820121459
and after her came madame de villefort   25.827557683682343
well said athos that only makes four   74.01388453663887
about how much   171.55883723573152
come in your excellency said vampa   80.1698690258456
we are all mortal   80.74632876006821
but my orders   102.80418530384489
the interests of the french crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation   102.31023849838917
then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors   136.54835120509074
he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers   79.16357449097413
franz and albert bowed   97.14703144307649
no we ve been used to those acclamations for some time   75.36075853627017
d artagnan did not know where he was and wished himself a hundred feet underground   65.2861992899478
here s an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby   137.76025819339452
bonacieux blushed   135.88887972175678
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of collicure wine   77.60096094139092
yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my arthur thou art a fond and faithful creature   90.150729817815
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course   0.9215921996664918
i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame continued the count with perfect calmness   125.81271124951697
but i must see him instantly   16.79591695656441
the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside   175.68575835461246
40074m haydée looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of monte cristo s voice had awakened her from a dream   73.23901670291508
where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital   136.1518486898837
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger   91.26081105767864
doctor every son of woman is born to suffer and to die   135.76806758833587
nothing shall be done without the full approbation of albert de morcerf   195.77479318500525
you will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the great mogul which the chevalier de guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles   123.99515577517997
the doctor went out first followed by m   238.85494558769193
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey   132.7184553085876
you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high treason   96.22997576507564
morrel back   142.38298979055054
inquired dantès   128.49618961419785
he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him   157.73222217032676
by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt   75.00305443821023
i say so and i repeat it for the third time   160.7201884363286
but why not porthos   28.213632723556742
fifty pistoles at most   66.37166188916798
i embrace you   122.0072851877068
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo   125.20154727807385
this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it   105.57176119984408
i come for your commands my lord he said   98.0956707526615
pray do people get into a passion at random at noisy   94.83620952279718
oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late diogenes   88.59614895793482
he said to the prisoner   126.09426143842249
i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos   181.349295011893
at your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one   57.80038140764855
nine days after leaving the charente pale with fatigue and vexation milady saw only the blue coasts of finisterre appear   95.68761181929389
it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind   118.90650220870818
i invent nothing madame   96.73207354707411
what promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience i have evinced   163.18302631964383
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort   101.27040447580727
there are no bandits cried debray   109.7859661006364
fine looking men upon my word   121.31527108106584
i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease   82.10029809857602
the host was at his door and everything was prepared bed bandages and lint   144.63464435835985
of what kind in the name of wonder   80.98883603460936
signor pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted   130.66008968655953
what are you waiting for   63.89279729663795
since there is no harm said athos in my knowing that d artagnan is here i presume there will be none in his knowing that i am here   19.67199008552133
what grottos   124.28687954813674
where your life was spared   192.70322521060518
what has he to say   180.78049982661608
that you had taken the place of another prisoner   121.98015038084186
true said andrea   91.34950228798425
sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest but the most graceful woman in france   144.33325541540268
parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise   68.24142133751408
well read then   151.3728345956626
dantès told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm   84.48101638169902
athos said a word to one of the vergers who bowed and proceeded toward the basement   112.68240082807206
i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself   171.94395584072564
as long as i live   83.08496894918059
i am ready said he   109.36067575424661
the duke however overcame all difficulties with a word his majesty s order   158.83888888656656
i made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known   114.8575866511559
at once if you please   118.81577844022473
at what o clock sir do you breakfast   68.54086349654308
he has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses   51.38806640995485
it was the signal of a visit   97.56783429041418
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice   81.83500412202449
grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere   127.51793577066027
should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the abbé busoni send for me if i am still on earth and i will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity   166.5297391841784
20 the performance of the civil marriage   73.31798957225726
we must have felt what it is to die morrel that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living   73.4267455553896
a thousand francs   140.6341611218665
d artagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward   104.18023598430538
gondy looked at mazarin astonished and mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the palais royal   105.8797403385336
albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice   117.37622649540083
she sat down took edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bosom   100.07588580405081
you have a good memory sir to recollect dates so well   49.13460465273502
you wish to see blois again   158.88754815649912
a fortnight after i was at rogliano and i said to assunta console thyself sister   149.7428943077341
but what did m   180.1170642366007
it is only fifty thousand francs everything included   75.72162787153543
her yes   96.84311563301176
i do not send you away but you have had the small pox and i am afraid that sitting up late may tire you   116.57899709021083
grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse   99.68400899273509
seriously said gondy astonished at not having further advanced   133.25570517813742
the young count s conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long   73.19757295733964
this time it was mordaunt who smiled   97.17977643310233
debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a mother of pearl knife inlaid with gold   63.21434153649186
you will then come on saturday   76.10214347714086
this is the reason that instead of the sixteen i had last year i have this year you see eleven already plucked twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen   188.91331711991438
had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your griefs   198.33940844257728
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or face it is not your fault   141.94516663883087
one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children   101.86077733235726
noirtier wishes to speak   72.83787649448509
sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you one this is all i can say   197.3249169465011
these have asked for the best   134.9705877619281
and did the eccentric person commit any new originality   125.4997026185762
go into the grotto and dress yourself   109.60097091035351
perhaps it was some one in that occupation said cromwell   79.16246812776828
don t let that disturb you   94.9021105554568
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès   141.30804842487254
inquired the first speaker   155.81565859483229
except that which i ask of you dear love   87.66038391822173
albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother   90.21449136956049
because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father   131.5867682069179
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead   129.16527838072565
his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head   105.86110734998758
albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked   152.5531544188058
but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty these passers by repressed their hilarity or if hilarity prevailed over prudence they endeavored to laugh only on one side like the masks of the ancients   121.21015950652567
this beverage required a good half hour to prepare   143.29237741637178
they have some business with you i think from what they told me the day before yesterday   175.88990319361577
are we not pretty good christians   147.6625840782984
no replied noirtier eagerly   143.1568982207357
in fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind   59.81640508792977
true he replied and my protector is very kind   141.4621566427915
do not leave me   117.99116307219978
the guards retired   118.47559133867685
milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end   100.0673214285711
alas said monte cristo it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides   163.18440133021093
i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rights that would be to accuse her majesty queen anne of falsehood   155.03252921174914
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you   141.1177852517649
the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out   152.31953004377468
you will be lost said the curate shaking his head sorrowfully   141.42694498588054
yes your majesty   126.3701310591124
well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army   56.165219703413335
no it is the name of the island he has purchased   108.85995643305587
yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen   69.47446314313157
have you seen madame de chevreuse   98.18053225412771
signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal   166.2156352666754
he came he said on the part of his eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the palais royal   99.31460970571506
signor pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent bréguet bearing the name of its maker of parisian manufacture and a count s coronet   135.6362189881111
a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal   102.08849441928774
a procurator s dinner chapter xxxiii   144.07201880242997
the mercer s pretty wife had disappeared   189.40415593497735
were it not for that i should thank you for you have worked for us   99.82953445928545
he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca   49.89796287024653
and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away   70.52426946396005
do you understand   151.34104762410817
this is a magnificent emerald and the largest i have ever seen said château renaud although my mother has some remarkable family jewels   60.563080163684035
danglars was tired and sleepy   103.52492082741003
and as to aramis to tell you the truth i have never been seriously uneasy on his account   68.7428744715586
do you hear anything   80.95609165387346
the events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then i will add them to my list of crimes   160.79985249568267
thus while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left she broke out into sobs and tears   121.61988914174017
surely said albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the countess g   230.43705243650697
i am unlucky   134.47221017783647
what does this mean monsieur cardinal   67.11224628842263
my husband the king is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired   87.64913628843274
20227m what time is it now   101.37935525939119
mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise   97.46863064550398
and further that he stated to m   202.85050998359588
but said beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you   53.64437063189399
eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are we   95.32910888235345
then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her room   195.32726632819447
what monsieur   211.4161940668486
well but we should be taken out of prison   104.7001309193237
but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from thinking   94.96875921807452
monte cristo gently smiled and said i was there   49.55588584054932
under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots   180.8434181282645
come come what then   173.80547022620382
you see that everything is to our advantage   133.44486064493134
de tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen   99.19737851171095
that dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than yourself   76.50431684461932
chapter ii   46.42926076627823
the extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely grecian   159.61201803768944
it was a magnificent sapphire encircled with brilliants   124.55617187794162
indeed monseigneur responded the mercer i have heard her pronounce all those names   130.26734874727214
then he had a moment s hesitation   168.06053064392376
i quit the world   106.95666431774289
said the governor   132.33798991507697
he opened his eyes and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village   88.69597746392841
happy rogue said caderousse   120.33339690128513
he would have inquired after them of their mistresses but he was neither acquainted with porthos s nor aramis s and as to athos he had none   129.62697925848684
in an hour you shall be obeyed   154.64659775154763
he was a clever man   81.63597804226404
d artagnan said athos gravely i assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that   135.8196235922016
and you know women don t like to be kept waiting   116.9986429128237
the affair at armentieres whispered d artagnan   84.03029225282074
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened if conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist   36.607380980589866
what nonsense   99.12305154772028
it is a folly i admit but still it is the fashion   61.54229096879986
and d artagnan who was very weary bade good night to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him   105.08692117343209
what do you think he is paying his addresses   76.69461392849988
we are very comfortable in those we wear   145.05269424377337
to be named the just you are right tréville   147.02120610813833
i wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody   117.16410962404433
endeavor not to make me wait   149.77306142987828
your eminence might be recognized   196.07768559212803
then as they were only a day s journey from surgères whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of athos and go with them   142.12341751039096
i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me   90.76616401768453
she heard the count s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity   162.6899094877715
she is going to have him killed said d artagnan to porthos but at all events it shall not be by me   109.61522163454873
neither is it my intention monsieur for this time i was seeking you   154.52491523561307
baptistin left the room   57.726425550153806
she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion   116.16415278971333
is there any difficulty in the way   125.7231873886769
do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy   131.24001444116578
i love a young girl count   191.3372773647443
i confess myself conquered   14.208531378728281
this dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb fruit   73.09835050743078
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse   101.80887977052075
and you did not tell him that you came from me   204.27866966721615
richelieu slowly tore the paper which d artagnan had generously relinquished   142.7415869402295
then turning to aramis aramis he said break your sword   174.38372224328424
but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your father   137.5051723785552
certainly in the eyes of an artist the exact and strict costume of teresa had a very different character from that of carmela and her companions   96.17946049288207
porthos an ass   115.8304113077912
i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death   151.49446819882667
danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions   71.1272369444855
albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young cavalcanti   7.675754099167179
and i too edmond oh   122.69964867279067
broussel was seated at the table with his family having his wife opposite to him his two daughters by his side and his son louvieres whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councillor an accident from which he had quite recovered at the bottom of the table   83.22553622666166
he offered him 1 000 francs for a mouthful of bread   221.15497190307545
he found him kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer book   196.34718247503721
that is to say he was there replied planchet   166.01347854667512
the true one as you say   95.63303133842722
it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory   90.13961156890579
but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink   110.09838666982073
replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the count s iron grasp   88.60620330139355
20312m at the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door   251.48131075343613
fernand mondego   78.90501610921223
he shall not come in before i am gone said he   115.05270452245263
princes must be knocked on the head   65.72370456367028
then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles   150.1899658082922
and by whom was he arrested   193.1084389861873
i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service i do him   174.55669157682334
nevertheless replied mordaunt i could compel you   180.68247820016933
i do not allude to you my boy   54.67204522502469
you would not then prefer a method resumed d artagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless   132.1166993675403
i wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil   41.34734495445019
my dear bazin you ought to perceive said d artagnan from the place in which you find me that i am greatly changed in everything   139.91499324177954
it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the pharaon has been built rigged and laden at the old phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city   102.71294968755802
he held a book in his hand   87.73288394007668
come and pass the night with me   144.93589556987797
here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon me   67.56891204190788
this was the more easy for our three companions in particular   118.21429758951712
there what do you think now of the affair   48.1735896866859
tell it to me   93.10021520940347
the notary who was at the door immediately entered   118.70644296365296
sir said d artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman   119.77374866180476
indeed indeed i did not   116.10955720105
well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu   207.4548485738394
and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne   142.52572184782937
come planchet let us pay a visit to the king s treasurer and then set off   62.05001100651684
that just shows the meanness of this slander   113.60817843422275
well morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart   150.44612065351822
it is the poniard   90.93446724056913
but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de tréville s   127.15915053375407
unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place   104.65325686722184
his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog   24.117736385122768
for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much   24.899435632802323
the money   173.85312182186078
and how shall i know whether your excellency has succeeded or not   81.56698553629587
so young said albert forgetting at the moment the count s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name   162.1396112578945
a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman   30.59831121774566
but in what force was the enemy   172.55980345929936
his life is dependent on the information he has given us   135.88068558154802
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy   125.65566899062289
a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat   81.5846370037874
although i had not seen villefort s face i recognized him by the beating of my heart   158.75805899834302
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure together   149.75015098412456
i beseech you   121.55287600958479
debray perhaps as it was once proposed   186.95163404251917
by the way planchet i think you are right with respect to our host and that he is decidedly a frightfully low wretch   41.777343389682756
be ready then at the first signal   78.29669121615545
jesu   95.76617809603218
try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might be try again you have a few minutes work there   162.62027587899016
i have no influence with any one   162.0653191898967
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars   142.25227487576157
if you know no more than that everyone here is as well informed as yourself   41.868256021275826
he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner   103.15990547601763
no said villefort burying his face in his hands no a hundred times no   147.40853736636933
the young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the messenger but he had disappeared   80.384212324625
it is more than ever a settled thing said lucien and considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures   57.64471512449448
who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school and moreover added he sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars   156.24952171956184
how go then   149.85947167453253
a great prince said aramis with whom mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him   86.66994631107438
yes i have seen him but i don t know what he calls himself   73.80451195935582
all that could be required of me   56.30092350639385
come you are no longer twenty years old   165.19199498289598
we shall get out into the gallery you have described   105.72644726192544
no but reasonably hideous   119.66055625810219
leave the saucepan said dantès   158.5449352373721
you see it s evident where the count got the name   63.62225881050706
but he had not time to address any question to him a cry of admiration burst from every mouth   168.24268209366215
madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her   140.4566501964919
without reckoning objected porthos that the queen would save monsieur de buckingham but would take no heed of us   170.51389012120532
what granted me   87.52072352238139
a thunder of applause saluted its appearance   116.10038169258837
it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants   115.06707377586713
de villefort who examined him attentively and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze   126.69500601472596
they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them   116.9924586489843
pray sir said villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb yourself   258.2658919031096
but hark hark   216.1652360900465
now to horse that i may see you depart   159.48984729661413
the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips   91.17085675167894
the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian   101.90931408027068
now if you have them   191.33822898749133
he insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from monsieur de conti or monsieur de beaufort or monsieur de bouillon or monsieur d elbeuf or the coadjutor or madame de longueville or broussel or the parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance   152.27775223737373
two aces   26.607841581894576
at this moment olivain appeared   185.35463730976522
but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal   97.95809716390767
agreed as to the old burgundy   147.64438650831818
to me she seems overloaded observed eugénie   71.14093707257757
his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile   90.99762734395769
hold athos said aramis perhaps there is yet time   25.113620834032176
more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp   73.06993365977019
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m   99.28401289395521
eh pardieu   129.39147501076863
i lost madame du vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in affliction on that account   140.22438618787584
we beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner baron danglars   96.74808071368811
the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was   177.2676722726736
well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits   112.81575004763314
kill myself   24.26300628309309
this is not my weakness i tell you at once   156.66419985637683
still there have been men who suffered more than you   60.34270127864805
said the swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade   162.1159740034852
on the contrary gentlemen we would assist you if it were necessary   147.45739058713156
tomorrow is the twenty third and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet   33.583374549625105
there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society   119.06512323372114
inquired the captain of the patrol   135.89675828200265
i will down with mazarin in french in good french my lord take care of your accent   160.61506440165087
well what do you want   222.4646882208565
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm   194.24476848459608
never did funeral knell never did alarm bell produce a greater effect on the hearer   109.12943154066572
ah that is where the art comes in   48.53099586774425
caderousse awed by the superior power of the abbé sat down and wrote sir the man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon   146.607920908382
the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad   146.7552983582469
and then there are robbers said la carconte   19.42977437930844
there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall   114.83808839937541
come he said stretching out his hand to d artagnan come don t be sullen my dear son for i have said all this to you if not in the tone at least with the feelings of a father   113.68169694655947
have you kitchens here   70.9927711320135
he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to you   116.93375224248918
inquired athos of the youth   138.1374005455879
20169m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions   88.1438628283959
d avrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them   115.83663381969717
besides the ordinary cicerone who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument nay almost to each part of a monument   159.6424493154147
the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner   87.00853170000589
you know what athos told you the other day   129.0941837929825
not only a benefactor but a father   225.67481876315946
of many things   155.91128421909613
replied d artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution   102.39379763640542
are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow creatures   165.9910478147971
guiche knew everybody madame de neuillan mademoiselle d aubigne mademoiselle de scudery mademoiselle paulet madame de chevreuse   107.03750571109384
and with this conclusion a way peculiar to himself he rose and left the room   77.32785180918674
i am not like you viscount   106.71639434346369
then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice laporte   120.42743246091818
my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector   76.42444519798029
i shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me   154.97614624694054
i i own that when my mind returns to that terrible period i have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor madame bonancieux   95.40288385672757
he was perhaps about to regain his liberty   115.43526230345458
asked the young man with glistening eye   96.85243357753055
madame madame   115.70860041919839
however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him   83.57895516938812
this personage was m   96.1035143954511
why did not the countess the proud mercédès the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour   164.83449524273493
d artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos   46.34319022066012
athos bowed and obeyed   91.76542064991293
it s tiresome work to keep awake a whole night   161.95766991019462
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips   144.6925884710879
well i was very near being hung by mazarin and that made me more popular than ever   150.55110452095977
count returned signor pastrini hurt at albert s repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions i do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed at   88.34771037892145
but your future career d artagnan your ambition porthos   159.43349997697675
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions   74.95144464777161
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy   133.93262492948875
a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier   163.09832337774492
never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends   139.1707965764309
why did not madame de lannoy come and inform you instantly   90.58562324641039
after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket   64.57986688151188
i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him   176.1369632372174
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy   150.78276569237724
de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count a warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made   37.689955776475216
but that it may prove laughter worthy even to the end let us not lose time   137.16971210349504
support a double weight   76.5933122171397
sir replied bazin the true friends of a christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing so   124.5102564776981
i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son in law of the marquis and marquise de saint méran   136.25309706351854
a thousand pistoles i said   157.3324776791024
march   112.21675900954254
here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been assured   123.55233464686967
it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment   152.17026168377402
is he not the son of general de quesnel who was created baron d épinay by charles x   129.2850549591647
then you did not bury the poor child there sir   109.44257939827538
nothing is lost then   79.06830264243759
then you will lie here said d artagnan   78.34722077455876
why replied porthos mouston of course   180.4767309942386
then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine   85.33507623045313
he got up and knocked on the door   118.05609327308781
is he then advancing on paris   65.85466735723571
come to us this evening and to morrow we ll return your visit   101.9675267490427
you do not know me yet   104.26623917611579
that worthy prince   69.23646204372027
my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that s a fair bet i hope   33.17699590219094
on their way they met grimaud   184.43965192318598
it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the future   93.37755516314067
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle   207.2101479132831
i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said   206.49016766342572
hurry hurry   192.74456444047695
what monseigneur   122.96838067691515
you would make me weep if such a thing were possible   91.17404432757095
said valentine looking anxiously around   194.22427833695718
then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal   115.35741422408265
patience monsieur everything will come in its turn   122.18549004964743
if it was mme   66.24756145605897
and i was asleep cried raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details   128.6467013156276
a deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described   118.27571727244958
a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy   145.79512082112797
there is no harm in trying to buy things cheap monsieur porthos said the procurator s wife seeking to excuse herself   82.0370841864293
he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos   161.58094557454797
it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hands and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life   193.17071304168797
left   143.94429800357537
i am thirsty that is all   38.038897790335014
the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous   131.94861908583428
they know me by heart and are steeled against all my weapons   102.46617013977156
franz took out his watch it was half past four   122.47524334721719
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task   112.12982241619336
you are right said morrel calmly   128.24414265032928
no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him   86.22058845517093
back already   116.61293752639783
i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious   103.60159467757154
when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning   108.15403410765278
i am a sailor   137.26205005681476
the young greek smiled   83.42004870588045
it is only half past ten o clock come in   141.71852757112939
heavens athos a murder   41.523156988667125
haydée said he you well know   95.84879567133996
because he is an enemy   152.22229900790322
some of the inmates of the lions den were watching the operations of the prisoner s toilet with considerable interest   129.03815187743348
andrea to think of marrying   121.30630298516212
your excellency has 5 050 000 francs in your pocket   107.25905859052517
to transport me for life how merciful   105.29053985152134
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé   53.44123578713798
with the same frankness i accept them   159.22167693446423
the commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with   120.49433576260245
that i may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables   41.850955451062234
he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom   0.4558148229335046
how so planchet   103.84886232111224
what athos   139.65002430644753
and give up your share of the venture said edmond to remain with me   123.18630985604116
i looked into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs   146.65280248119797
it is singular said the doctor   157.82350150687438
the little fellow who arrived last night in a post chaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds   74.2298532200776
ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion   169.5158447352402
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them   114.23352481684013
then you pity him   127.26439593241484
40120m villefort shrieked clasped his hands and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air   78.33314265606478
and then when bonacieux s cries were no longer audible good   189.65543985940138
but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me d artagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us   101.31254173809732
the day passed away as rapidly as an hour   222.87151704673965
but grandmamma leave me go   130.424422634542
at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions   120.94708948901099
bonacieux pushed a little servants door open by day but generally closed at night   128.70571280292108
monsieur albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general   149.1841146188686
but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came   195.17180727669108
the peasant started off running before the prince s horse   110.87428835721494
finally the prince led the right wing resting on aunay   99.9547856824089
i neither know nor care   66.64963108905775
monsieur d artagnan is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at least   126.85522755010155
peter blessed with the fingers   135.59888330993525
then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords   126.51412533883982
i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening   157.40363369033992
ah that is what i do not know   176.2769242904346
i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugénie   107.02610419292496
that is different   24.946829474467904
on the contrary i think they are poor sir   134.1586966777147
tell me what is the matter   105.16092895908318
by jove my lord said d artagnan you have well said but these are only words   110.62187422876326
for instance that henri iv   162.1335696450456
i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey me   92.22902398281842
no quarter   78.08132488065306
what a dreadful death what a blow   77.28268042862902
i do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow   132.84368612115802
when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery   161.20806345530573
d artagnan the elder   148.98518837337113
the window turned on its hinges and a man entered   57.33215163910412
and now prisoner will you consent to tell your name   99.97799001246445
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sister in law was a prostitute a branded woman   143.03980931092377
your majesty has treated her with a severity it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours duke however high they may be placed and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them   87.65576680414074
we stepped into the boat   92.2207424048757
but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison   147.7905073815601
but they might be the fruits of a plot   91.17795318177988
you are a worthy daughter of epirus haydée and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace   73.87743534558228
asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation   90.05516878980782
and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who can not even see whence all their afflictions come   138.05814087747837
my friend urban grandier wasn t a sorcerer he was a learned man   107.43144792800551
no not yet   103.09076154101929
it may be observed that at the very moment when thanks to the ray of the sun he perceived the gun barrel he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his eminence with respect to him   176.63736342910184
perfectly said the dragoon   120.96005955300987
ah said beauchamp you doubt me   171.4074964063638
it is god s pleasure that things should be so   190.68861194179732
i have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy you are a brave youth d artagnan interrupted the cardinal tapping him familiarly on the shoulder charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature   137.68623034146387
the count bowed again but lower than before   73.46331521387069
well replied mazarin and am i not almost a king king indeed of france   189.53972146735697
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid   154.3283677230899
come she added   13.162015423784084
the other members silently dispersed   47.20545888235907
but what are you up to   159.9345575628234
for the first time in his life danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire   151.05138959621553
but i suppose you had no tools to aid you   53.213443337497715
does he correspond with aramis   97.21782304696943
he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent   174.75879639409192
and he threw the money into the river   137.03197235858678
in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one   127.92300305781868
a miserable old age awaits you   53.62999021287901
i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof   84.08972106269854
when you please replied beauchamp   142.51453120950055
come come thought d artagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly monsieur planchet is no fool   88.05331468224705
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing   144.25450485504882
thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose   46.23495231622185
it is a bad sign   169.56896675986107
in addition to this d artagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and monsieur de tréville   98.16699840034985
but what must i do   115.73216690985419
yes said m   107.13444386158551
as for the two others i had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that i have forgotten their real ones   132.14346327116954
and lastly aramis the third to take orders and become an abbé   148.89683899868737
cried olivain reappearing at this accusation   179.48940706474264
but these two corsican bandits   181.91513056719225
then an idea came to him which harmonized everything   27.529877683046436
one instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridor his ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder   169.44710362712243
take   176.21245172715547
no politics caderousse   86.76165754138378
my sister how did your husband die   109.80893316195555
not with us sir replied dantès   2.392572422682889
but on the road an aide de camp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle   76.33042936314325
d artagnan was perplexed   72.55467699146081
well said milady what can those who sleep wish for a happy awakening   61.07395347684445
a whole bottle   89.15550646937706
i have abjured my affections and like all renegades i am of evil omen to those who surround me   111.25466326304446
tell me have you ever thought that seven times 1 700 000 francs make nearly twelve millions   150.52297629309504
soon as the road turned the chateau de la valliere appeared in view   78.80819001915695
exclaimed porthos in dismay   156.488190740814
to return instantly to england and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves london   108.0048104117304
mousqueton will lose another that s five   146.85524572120278
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis   96.57859762306347
then calling planchet he said now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that   171.60875217866152
buckingham at once remembered the circumstance and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards he put his horse into a gallop and rode straight up to d artagnan   67.29003536573599
and both set off towards the capital at full gallop   146.97475076255634
by a murder   82.76386035067398
i declare to my nephew guido spada   156.8115993743616
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position   38.24016204680099
see i have thought about you look at the good breakfast we are going to have   55.033488652331535
irrevocably   102.8823175948587
and this very nearly ruined the minister   84.05302441861954
shall you be attacked on the road   34.29264580239713
de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china   151.5534589396795
the four men stood motionless   108.01675702031386
then what may it be   120.5047949967988
you discovered what had become of your mother   89.88458839594273
really you alarm me   124.13923899027004
it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices   148.38228478076132
but d artagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams   203.0178688676118
the duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter   145.54189418488215
cocles made no reply   78.23115649036184
if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched   121.95191298775467
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it   123.285392989775
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers   70.54323619621562
i stretched out my arms   101.47115410832039
it is a wound that confines him to his bed   124.54298467044853
friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road   89.37751319319482
as for me you must know i can not possibly live out of lucca   75.94226601173503
very well sir replied broussel what is this order   119.32670027697901
will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained   66.71849715956421
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him   86.3629834838847
but the son will be here   152.25515750728005
all s well he cried as he entered   129.69747873177548
while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience   94.96281419827793
silence child   156.00120170694174
no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited   147.80192144010576
the mêlée became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers   146.87092345896636
i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain   273.610823755235
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you   105.09527748720802
returned the count with surprise   61.31780921888274
a wintry blast   133.7957674900444
the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of m   156.81509005080363
that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you   161.50008712776034
for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name   173.50213884996748
this poor child is quite resigned as she knows she can not live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger   129.45905485768165
you are included in the conscription fernand and are only at liberty on sufferance liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms   67.45879088724628
said d artagnan who began to understand   118.71527988823118
franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx like smile   199.5461454402435
d artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet   131.27016142328938
it is true murmured the englishman   158.92510126911887
that is never done   159.0926150531788
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you   70.46717792325516
d artagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends   94.67488397694254
it is so long since we were separated that i have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects   155.95183697126595
the young woman complied   60.03883163358331
very well said the voice   156.49953367347615
she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased   41.744453661114875
well if you are cold planchet you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder and be in waiting for me at the door by six o clock in the morning   157.5178917612484
porthos fired   102.13344033289448
but my lord you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered   53.65661926131874
perhaps returned the count smiling   95.48686978054819
but the other four cursed it heartily   157.84712600220303
upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before bazin   50.15626672152786
yes said he i made a vow to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger   178.36719316280863
he came hoping that i would accept my shame as my shame was consummated   113.14696447915318
cried aramis pale with anger suspecting that d artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with madame de longueville   71.60242426701208
but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added athos knitting his brow monsieur d artagnan shall not leave us   80.03911191283505
scratches himself   127.14877981422144
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice   50.22439493206258
50282m during the perusal of this letter which informed valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother she became pale a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom and tears not the less painful because they were silent ran down her cheeks   66.556220145873
and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers   100.68600051557706
and what was the result of those duels   54.40204277323526
you have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded   175.59644297985056
do not be unhappy dear friend on that account   161.06838459395203
six hundred   80.02855909755317
ing invited to dine by his holiness   114.2019060061005
which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july replied danglars   68.11679164992483
yes of you   173.40965119640356
d artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step   118.90411638839056
de villefort who had been the king s attorney at nîmes and afterwards at versailles   123.44287882540779
raoul bent his knee to the ground   99.89381666068607
mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked room she who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir   207.53317473538561
the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous   108.09635951048823
and your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at liberty   148.6373921618688
you are mistaken viscount   138.4615546214169
said bertuccio   167.4487659050851
the house belongs to him   84.65069507517414
certainly quite ready   199.17694352296684
the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple   75.35577144841308
but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments   89.0860308929418
i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity   127.45908533085083
charles rose and turned toward parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture   137.13460998724324
i accept them at once   148.17527009239677
i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor   163.26189521511918
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name   120.14029548414875
besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner   86.73191124420616
yes said danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair   49.90758255553317
yes indeed the marks are recent   83.35446665925866
i don t believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial   115.56244212930167
my apartment will be close to his   136.93005652218983
well now that will do wonderfully well said athos   171.540683470326
and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile   108.8991846092822
the lion was daunted   119.4207171750774
his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness   91.57264604651066
the army i will answer for it will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs   128.79203592378397
the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street   119.99837613242678
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes   52.40689186685139
on my return vasiliki and her daughter haydée had disappeared   148.90739878813167
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer   132.90174881195705
hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough   24.20511842780752
the day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me   62.373599408697274
while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water   122.80281850289417
the anger of heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and i am innocent   163.16948418618992
dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise   157.02289433814494
that she shall not with one blow dishonor her husband and her child   106.78158067812994
i am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good french for i resided three years in paris   104.40327419991347
then on the honor of a mazarin as i am and ever shall be i hope said the cardinal   122.70966368876545
haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives   40.45442428054052
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics   157.8732802140861
the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes   110.80931566776977
i have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling manner   80.3493442481265
here said he leaning heavily on the arm of monte cristo here is the spot where my father stopped when the pharaon entered the port   125.01383504753416
instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase   180.5912051138855
yes in your own way   151.56794396924013
de villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair   159.0516216668954
no fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts   60.71459183695099
30111m do you think so   114.29823685050071
this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us   103.46886631025271
i know not why you meddle said fernand seizing his arm   152.77811561979556
when seven o clock came dantès agony really began   123.41554564067299
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his   122.93219552823403
procureur   144.0930677471367
drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it   44.38824405379998
he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel   136.96324485593857
if his eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my musketeers said tréville the justice of monsieur the cardinal is so well known that i demand an inquiry   97.05909609441724
monte cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion   40.49766918136294
surely answered danglars one can not be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air   139.24634319846473
i do not know sire answered the minister of police   53.83894068918763
monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron s card   146.27553415209033
the king s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity   127.97647438807412
all crossed themselves   81.97104666736875
but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still   115.22092976791507
but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent   121.92238703352837
let us then take advantage of it   116.04952786816371
handsome well bred noble lord as you are my dear athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations   211.87482729823802
the baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward   131.74494208663566
monsieur is full of generosity said athos   149.10523074084207
he said as to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace   84.34957990875132
the abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving   117.41864479329035
that is the sum m   127.46097390388215
yes said athos it reminds me of a family jewel   165.58697721865832
are we not   199.9370612213096
it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris   141.79312889620698
d artagnan went from captain groslow to colonel harrison and from colonel harrison to his friends   70.61672170876008
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again   98.52173177122155
you see said porthos this is my usual style   84.18668215602992
de tréville chapter iii   112.09307066580416
still higher   64.58092923096643
but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued   154.0012823852634
more than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends an undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive   136.15681277911565
but i warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the count   102.62834576377972
good night friend   153.40399250527597
oh yes i heard that   145.77671400229065
his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away   122.40446497148598
it was all up with him continued aramis   138.9696773398738
i did not say france my lord   106.14653027259261
but i carry your word with me do i not   125.94183519749355
my father has revealed the culprit s name   109.82758160329519
what is your name then   86.14365100272194
surely that is where you yourselves sleep   166.06356291527564
we anchored our vessel which had a double hold where our goods were concealed amidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the rhône from beaucaire to arles   66.12020327270938
after that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort   30.202029311342955
one is for seven o clock and the other for eight   35.524912598101736
my dear d artagnan said aramis don t be too angry with me i beg   105.63492130763862
gervais   127.05611482621923
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false   82.93398765269814
madame danglars was chatting at a short distance with debray beauchamp and château renaud   160.80700321331673
but friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage   84.1403814998705
athos asked   67.43215411017752
he spoke in a voice of the procureur general with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law   153.40768518178515
madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something   103.43016659505241
and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty   104.61951824869787
and is that all is that all   156.571924341694
the captain m   143.43846722761566
i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions   91.712552591302
he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve   91.58239493600323
for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before   58.250634192553306
the cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger   103.55850959664951
have you not perceived it   36.24961270312032
chapter xliii   104.14768015266466
the corsican ogre at the sight of this agitation louis xviii   122.887498011847
the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends   80.38150408726378
can he give me any particulars   148.23049845696107
go on then i listen   146.52447666781757
he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos   196.81483694450003
it is the monk whispered porthos to aramis   144.90740371360695
the coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three together   137.7609456736632
in the court of the old chateau of saint germain he entered his coach and reached the seine at chatou   137.77830819030066
thousands of wild goats   119.93678927399952
what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this   106.12805964978399
repeat your father s name said the president   165.75226182155203
now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch   72.10732743849691
you have a park and horses servants   118.30122544769195
he did not wear the uniform cloak which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence but a cerulean blue doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water ripples in the sun   68.6470099357037
cried d artagnan wringing his hands   117.17803773482123
speak monsieur   143.2062594007785
the room resumed its obscurity   153.0116206707528
although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfather s fortune i do not think that m   40.54778772632771
i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions   68.44129442159752
athos came down last and found d artagnan already on horseback and growing impatient   97.44356705198709
has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin   206.73651788947242
but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce   78.66697905877086
and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said respect to fallen majesty   185.15807558952662
that then is your opinion   93.01580391376618
why does he go in secret   132.97097056986917
the coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his life   97.65793803348797
50049m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here   66.1136525228709
this way this way my dear albert   115.99886045977406
said porthos what a fearful day my dear d artagnan   119.10653964673108
when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream   85.23697017051605
murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure   83.91408053783141
into the blue drawing room according to your excellency s orders   136.52970994065168
villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart   145.399391215492
it was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead   149.85291449438694
during this short time valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept it was madame de villefort   103.3884009491609
but she was greatly embarrassed   178.58965301502818
this is terrible said athos   122.16516727567368
it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers by   34.678970229029275
can we do anything for you   152.21054650808344
gervais athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner   210.03276942267314
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel   105.42812952193358
he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i agreed   69.34215731657002
yes replied d artagnan   100.00906808369524
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections   148.83043287159495
said monte cristo putting the light near his face   135.66517974877797
porthos was discontented with his condition   178.33224857884107
besides nobody came thither but the three musketeers   145.43133723577452
one thing however reassured him   125.50651399129545
give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him useful   151.31517905743783
base coward   119.85073274904353
try porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows   163.66314673505428
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive   221.68017880299618
do you know m   160.6204492400766
permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount   82.90304685880565
he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife s and daughter s jewels and a portion of his plate   148.5727809164266
as the carriage stopped at the door and albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a letter   121.84621511231614
i do assure you grandpapa ah m   193.84122747230302
to take mazarin   182.98033461807827
five minutes later he came down the grand staircase   107.5288913440831
that ring is defiled d artagnan   153.70219060884122
four of these men were our musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just received   109.6315138024468
you are discreet so much the better   14.167595783898705
the avenger   81.18099954160601
ali mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared   96.56407594071047
i wish i had never seen you   80.18100284381259
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again   91.00739205336001
through the gate was seen kitchen gardens carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the country   125.07847902377347
is the conference ended   109.54685931755552
but she with a strong movement tried to escape   132.85945808611802
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone   90.07788269967355
and she came back without this casket   97.06163583690741
he drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the garter which she had sent him by those generous frenchmen   117.05098747732791
that s exactly the reason i won t go said d artagnan   164.48423972045558
you know the best harbors   157.400470206157
besides in what manner can i make advances first   108.34300759141342
he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of mme   141.8245681803864
and passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the door   169.0800597821563
his charities alone amount to 20 000 francs a month   146.07679429953112
at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale   120.96284659803847
you have no reason to envy him on that score for i owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which recalled marie michon to aramis and to athos   138.8638501421141
d artagnan had fallen into an ambush   183.52485229138244
his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical   94.93745139246153
well edmond i swear to you by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity edmond for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold   57.317838537762796
where i am going   54.719767979575046
important ones   227.9727648370386
this time bonacieux became so pale that d artagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter   189.00491768770073
it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity   98.15821694878218
he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheek bones of grimaud were favorable signs   172.01273853357333
and what is that great lord s name   119.20190747750705

she then bowed to m   162.5948394242417
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words   66.24880116876292

its purple visage and its violet colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet   93.03557193300848

i do not know sir   55.83648207967186
then said the count your feeble spirit will not even grant me the trial i request   92.95138756841348
and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief   63.86848822986733
cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle   95.48582792469395

50087m but mademoiselle de villefort stammered the nurse   99.79001555042414
i said anything i pleased in order that the solemn declaration i have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the case   81.69779932957002
a point short you know the proverb   88.00272652311374

his whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes like the effects of a fever   183.0557595230257
that is the name of a mountain cried the poor questioner who began to lose his head   143.18526600763155
well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts   95.62026913446057
does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders   89.86885836399954
i had such a delightful dream   62.07645220185734
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation   88.52956853128399
in a word an almost poetical fervor prevailed   186.69948847069634
he stops at the gate   223.6786881068452
the circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly   32.58695661774951
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to act   99.35159221285505
and as a proof there is a crown to drink my health   117.26130476970242
madame said debray it is nearly six months since we have been associated   158.48607328964215
felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration   60.359368211046124
demand anything you want and i will hasten to have you furnished with it   165.3403175058422
exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress   59.90069561223345
certainly madame said porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck   156.4296403980299
towards the evening of the third day   115.34306431879018
mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of d artagnan   37.81509663628839
indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the bastille   122.82977498244126
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master   152.81679434296603
so rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids   141.7564582310771
i know what i wish to know   78.58463702568572
but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in   141.0586431685704
you positively recognize m   88.27263752320857
but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son   113.72228309337947
from this phrase d artagnan awakened planchet the reader must not suppose it was night or that day was hardly come   90.28489445704356
all you have in gold   171.3316756778762
one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as ocean s most unfathomable caves   125.53134017315449
he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt   144.12316487706514
you are right said du tremblay   89.49208360407927
ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese   82.0831433809497
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which to day we are trying to perform for charles i   17.336357883899666
but in the meantime well in the meantime   80.57367367336255
before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in   146.26620577438456
you are edmond dantès cried villefort seizing the count by the wrist   126.2174631937872
is it my fault you have lost 700 000 francs   176.64773652298638
notwithstanding your father s wishes to the contrary   104.82792497305181
after dinner the play   144.9057558896241
it is quite wonderful said albert   176.55342605887537
a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings   118.30685120791787
i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body   46.4799366029016
cried franz whose hair stood on end   226.75520110516243
i have no doubt of it said d artagnan   49.965880204007206
muttered d artagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse   43.93264098705204

but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin   88.40485918120973
he returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed   84.00861218553987
he hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart   137.30458685932487
qui vive   93.6067596595062
i have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your apartment   125.66320086896967
where is the count friend   99.05203275376404
but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake   16.87444641733893
listen madame said gondy   177.9777454973932
why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage   67.24897701777678
and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son   91.87543840646622
badly enough   156.59777899417918
you shall take him with you there   36.16143449329613
prepare yourself for every emergency   135.1123320998966
the paragraph was correct my friend   190.70858393579323
i predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs   41.99180732433541
chapter lxxxi   45.72627841458072
he was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon it   82.3284887053731
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at porthos   82.10801652600503
morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit   67.11742058592056
then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the king s blood   106.33715806552726
he is an abbé   120.75449817330885
i admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady   120.70875237421882
a short time since i passed through marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections   122.69473475385288
marquise marquise   142.83630028680696
her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan   91.06073094331322
oh fear not said maximilian stopping at a short distance i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me   80.66307252144533
you do not deny it   60.18531213248105
i am the bearer of a letter that is all   164.6850177872956
after my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man i shall hear you with pleasure sir   118.33895726136747
and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof   165.65221046623904
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening   133.0830186356119
if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose   55.5241671424334
but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal   120.89306829832896
one would say you were already in possession of your property   90.90566635985755
i am about to struggle for the last time with them   134.26490659983037
peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl   202.7248507854934
but when i have no more money left to pay you   129.30106692177336
stop a minute   64.99810736062838
no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed   108.87718106902518
wait a week and i myself will give you some   192.71858657345254
i have something better than that said monte cristo   132.82650716534147
and how old were you at that time   121.74294663730393
monte cristo turned to albert   122.79497319127356
returned the turnkey   123.0278857707979
if not you were an accomplice   90.68736303831187
not so fast   153.52892431564604
you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say   148.92968914132723
turning towards athos and his friends gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you please   47.05577215359098
in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her   106.63477380363831
let m   113.61630873624058
said she you have saved me   52.9681640764746

chapter 109   107.45782048664476
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them   131.23105983021517
do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you   132.09913091405372
let us put down 120 added albert smiling   92.41933394715647
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world   112.99817947935264
she was stone dead   88.1630345985443
through the darkness franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated   93.27146074414715
my husband has given me his word sir said madame de villefort   128.49582016842328
they are friends of yours then   108.58401959385652
asked lucien   80.73426660890877
the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them   109.466254953983
your mother would die of grief   143.2307819096235
have you been or are you his mistress   166.53812624834487
cried athos astonished   140.07721300117467
i am all attention madame said he   170.26618321318608
d artagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross   205.76065964974757
you like m   63.109135565016054
that proves returned the abbé that you are like those of holy writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear not   109.53803355596375
upon my word you would make caesar afraid   72.67687453740416
oh you despise them   101.31440558825884
this portion of the napkin was marked with half a baron s crown and the letter h   121.27768818609906
he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to command   118.5405365845071
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten   97.339741630312
then he raised the flag stone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber   72.85371811895078
but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die   143.79594258885203
the fact is said d artagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton   139.8662435111927
yet i repeat to you albert be prudent   104.13118824156984
ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving d artagnan how glad i am to see you   105.51232577865531
athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to aramis and the third to porthos   79.22675802322334
i see him very often said danglars drawing himself up   24.406402664320865
the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise   92.17104186174565
to mademoiselle de la valliere   100.16492754251216
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand   152.54122942017798
let us wait by all means   51.83640543494378
duty before everything   144.75446275891426
wait for me here all of you   12.75696260800143
how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten   153.9102993505677
hold continued d artagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is monsieur du vallon who comes with his coat torn   95.77422412112787
and that in the presence of witnesses   164.18430495759662
to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them bassette passe dix and lansquenet in their utmost nicety and winning from them by way of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour their savings of a month all this was enormously delightful to porthos   114.57804246201562
in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand   57.464087546096074
well cried his auditors   91.51051885075229
my god have mercy upon me   51.54274249276344
d artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use   124.67117198833486
i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars   69.5404921709364
now for the tally ho   45.79743432332282
you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning   68.38481578811306
as for porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it   130.3450895860538
athos upon a horse he owed to a woman aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress porthos on a horse he owed to his procurator s wife and d artagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortune the best mistress possible   26.90086717543568
faith no   128.22230435525472
does the count know what answer you received   92.71139803867094
he accepts said monte cristo   74.12963604269913
a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlord s hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m   107.39779199886983
the time of the carnival was at hand   77.33782894262974
this address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand   95.88632682089985
ah yes said the count   150.75042933143138
the escort divided into two files   82.63568301104284
it struck ten   112.51939950115172
athos said d artagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven   171.8435684262995
to leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger   163.40273701376327
now said he that suffices begone   111.01575974029369
porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea   65.17162125729222
thus for instance don t you in the first place want a horse   99.88077018294719
he will not go today said d artagnan   140.79030773640923
you will charge broussel to report it   82.21860181715348
fernand cried mercédès i believed you were good hearted and i was mistaken   121.5689694048747
this cost me on your account and mine 100 000 francs   26.36555852448423
i accuse no one sir said danglars   56.64315209469425
he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty   83.540338877134
that renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste   115.78957421084263
my left side still pains me   135.98268218644222
balzempleu   28.204916775967575
do you think emmanuel would oblige me   58.13631367917612
repeated beauchamp looking with amazement at the count   40.911553275530125
come be candid said the coadjutor you have not all your life followed the trade which you do now   112.74765456037946
they both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for   124.155283126925
de villefort you have promised me have you not   137.1718607980489
he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly   49.02214108067166
what would you have me say   74.69535454412795
was i not a good ambassador in france   132.15273681368302
the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense   112.54648627807234
at the language you use   210.30856858423698
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance   87.04616425602829
20243m confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beauchamp   81.79238221218989
you will go to london continued the cardinal   104.11959469474809
pardon me said he my dear baron but one of my friends the abbé busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in paris   68.30676026534039
all is lost   102.04830980908571
stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar   105.769736104355
as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous   77.8947340530977
and i shall die in the performance of my duty   90.11680468488655
what a misfortune   48.70696021117841
the old man uttered a cry and turned round   68.21248798574055
only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour   157.8613446290094
allow me time just to kill this gentleman and i will return and finish the last couplet   69.51772976469579
these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other   188.39243893831417
yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him   40.94399976941693
i have answered for you   122.29071391186666
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de médicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik   71.28808220435636
the minute hand moved on   79.46292916263016
it was a masonic sign caderousse had taught him   33.85275076643242
the four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark   160.41031648272258
to the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses   111.73284495231293
oh yes was the ready answer   135.58711632205743
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris   47.30962411729183
and when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued d artagnan   48.92562023382203
athos repeated d artagnan s words   102.69301039882379
your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects   79.19690310189664
finish mouston finish the work   169.78583722778
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe   111.98242498232061
milady sprang out of bed   74.43547831660347
i was passing close to the door of the captain s cabin which was half open and i saw him give the packet and letter to dantès   48.511496451766774
let him pass   97.77676398266954
but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed   90.47886602736988
it had now become a weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces   109.48422838721976
and what does he wish   115.45778734278805
30 champs élysées   40.00528565498992
having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat   120.22807911262373
and planchet dined by sleeping   99.2496321059386
the headsman of bethune   97.44133870377884
it s of no importance   131.94882035481146
and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat   87.79749332171927
said the figure   157.06460470756386
madame cried mazarin what are you about   85.87287460457001
in any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of monsieur de chavigny   107.65083673519186
he crossed the court ran up the two flights to athos s apartment and knocked at the door enough to break it down   89.33265139638726
now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abbé formerly leader of a party in italy who has been here since 1811 and in 1813 he went mad and the change is astonishing   150.69188471550822
the two friends went to the hotel de vendome   164.61628769620964
so you and the cardinal have been talking about me   35.8638736958614
twas the first time d artagnan had ever refused a request from athos   91.15132638758385
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than before   156.43290498506053
the king danced facing the queen and every time he passed by her he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the number   78.03726116559889
i know all these things   62.126582290623915
i think he has not been arrested and as i am his wife s confessor if she knows where he is i shall know it too   4.7217255491490135
hate you sweet valentine exclaimed the young man   97.21212316504153
apropos what are the names of your friends   120.2179719529153
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs   97.9154196134931
what is the matter then with this dear child   98.73853162671094
what signifies a delay of half an hour   114.23166609579825
they were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa   155.0221334860446
they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for them   48.85311435840413
you are going into the garden   133.04891034861558
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise   79.26410300844321
the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase   70.11225240658864
then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments m   85.6652601738
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible   92.89335583315167
i will give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this device tenax   95.4640304964088
but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty   70.45873160491209
neither am i said porthos   89.45218325719709
d artagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted   122.47060282137033
by force   63.30264607456882
have you forgotten anything   144.1393713278272
you will not interfere in anything   174.10433455423785
you talk of sacrilege   111.86921802742333
what still keeping up this silly jest   135.38353633108918
danglars did not answer   62.45317227536198
d artagnan only sighed   107.14469132744541
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him   129.59205016236743
and since he has chosen me as his interpreter i will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions   191.63120183014794
but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him   39.24719963445983
tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it   151.05730344367416
he knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that   64.83690709397845
no interrupted mercédès but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son   127.24923012593584
asked d avrigny placing his hand on noirtier s shoulder   112.47399550666803
you do not madame   102.30144326129502
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances   165.4809370740708
the inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition   83.99548665513126
but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered   88.00203894296699
which is a consolation   13.524805448236222
and who has filled your head with all this nonsense   141.16804070717558
the duke smiled   81.5482060420263
said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever   122.6677129814599
speak out then say what it was   100.6349510926697
i believe that besides the packet captain leclere confided a letter to his care   106.84161280227269
science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one   154.0637703540219
and as d artagnan as he spoke looked at harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself   117.5347055564973
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions   70.56788843866667
let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with shame   111.4084473762363
oh if so punish me as you will   68.64399114663378
noirtier fixed his eyes on her   106.84974947932807
i pledge you my word madam said the abbé that my intentions are good   11.781332399130136
i had no such contempt for men before   91.84284567438013
we will talk italian and spanish   117.05936192557245
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen   28.811373969062217
so much the better i have a ray of hope left   127.35147857302745
he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants   85.50332096065972
and now to table said athos   110.98394443655094
today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father s and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at la réserve   127.71422604793452
has anyone besides me seen madame de saint méran   167.2385420299602
then i have only to make arrangements for the duel said beauchamp   154.23589272820783
poor barrois was very thirsty and was thankful to drink anything he could find   137.93051657080375
yes madame it is the custom not from gallantry but prudence that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular hôtels in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them   161.66632164106127
yes madame he shall live said monte cristo surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her   90.22467793668133
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips   156.2207913670393
three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism   199.96932171250205
de tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair   182.92157073498538
do you wish a step or some place in the government   44.98143156075466
and beg m   168.65670943492742
the month passed and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources   83.70829136463418
he said to himself   143.64033355364975
but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on   147.73447378835505
léon d armilly twenty years of age   50.1850563181347
but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not   57.18007107842207
albert s lips scarcely whispered good bye but his look was more explicit   127.48112828381016
her mistress was mad with love intoxicated with joy   70.01083734066641
but traitors to england are no longer members of my family   128.1145122350813
it is quite immaterial to me said monte cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle   164.79597699239645
you will see what a fellow he is   73.20619891729567
ah my poor friends   18.43642941543213
i do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her   83.63472785381835
ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set   208.6354607183883
there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle   59.57297011264159
and so my dear count said d artagnan his eminence didn t actually insist on our attending him   203.8803381205356
he who was but half as old would sacrifice six   133.46039348631874
at first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year i became used to it   61.34682442821443
one last favor my lord   166.36167292894223
where then   142.98955939499916
said madame de chevreuse hastily   117.41103668780744
she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed   166.67515098218956
i entreat you doctor   80.86343062311155
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself   112.43152474169575
the rest of mademoiselle eugénie s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described   80.08070040170112
i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now   74.92714529991892
de tréville smiled at this flourish   229.72901124066271
he would never think of faring in the same manner as his master   100.24904858233761
the count with a smile of profound tenderness extended his hand and she carried it to her lips   127.61393860942746
as for you my dear lieutenant i promise you nothing   81.93056400149179
whenever it shall please your majesty   124.23961190410851
in the first place said athos let us leave this chamber   111.34764510793364
let her humble herself then and come to me first   67.88898974968433
bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close   68.1812836953211
villefort had never been so concise and eloquent   68.15464993928818
oh do not be alarmed   68.35025642754329
d artagnan and the curate appeared pleased   50.06749904192789
then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the door   100.95160739586223
i have only two adversaries i will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even them they are time and distance   83.7985614659099
au revoir benedetto   71.14799121491737
and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor   137.2444673929034
what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming   90.16255710340691
that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by d artagnan a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey   165.91753692375352
but although her voice sweet full and sonorous vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut   176.82175103061672
see and she exposed her face completely to view see misfortune has silvered my hair my eyes have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim of purple and my brow is wrinkled   51.39128184215761
monte cristo bent his head   130.39549878293516
i will denounce this place of infamy   149.74811782531384
he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in m   131.3861854401252
your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and i could say to you as that good la ramee said to me of the duc de beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out   201.68329847040673
but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him   84.81324156544888
asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother   155.70993270695635
certain   40.37261362278329
one doesn t descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle but by the branches of a lime tree   73.46807547290064
the favorite the confidant the first man in short at the court he had been obliged to yield his place to mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor   19.739072523854645
my dear count cried morcerf you are at fault you one of the most formidable logicians i know and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist   85.63172365000551
if i am an officer your fortune is certain for i shall have money enough for both and moreover a name we shall both be proud of since it will be our own   94.75986021671815
pray tell me how it happened   45.36833780645354
she passed the night thus   136.5367163258292
well returned morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune i must habituate myself to shame   66.07194269966338
albert and franz looked at each other fearing really to abuse the count s kindness   195.55820089465485
do not surrender egad   70.29829917625003
was there not some snare laid for her   138.9916695380637
a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at it   130.52313114844682
while he had been absorbed in thought they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail   139.02494425142066
grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a chair   140.3195603267816
said d artagnan to porthos   162.27932966724939
is not this true fernand   189.6797390801342
they ask my age   141.21099445039573
and i will say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance   124.71878629005406
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model   77.72792193837581
do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys   90.53223391915542
as if they had been one man as if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast   172.85545111375902
in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the child s face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young   99.92104496547175
this man was surrounded by officers   95.80121214873525
ah if you command me that s another thing said bicarat   75.2228805110332
the lady had a cavalier shut up with her said athos but as notwithstanding the noise this cavalier did not show himself it is to be presumed that he is a coward   147.67106174941722
aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively manner   29.602779687988686
he darted from the room followed by the count   95.31539557660567
and yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veins passion drunk with contempt   108.48868526337831
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him   101.83841206815106
there is something very peculiar about this chief then   108.30192179102602
the jewel is yours my dear athos   91.75199143057985
then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners   91.19964080999137
but he must make me a baron   12.604341862799401
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone   127.76719890030671
he again arose and went to the door   99.7522686703423
he reflected that this coalition of four young brave enterprising and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks fencing lessons and practical jokes more or less witty   118.56272501201111
gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else   119.86592484330407
de morcerf quick   148.9184297315952
but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed when a company of the guards of his eminence commanded by m   163.25938859337762
said the king i was unjust   90.24283769929079
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman   73.88329816927981
and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the atlantic   30.726883460007798
all remains the same then in that quarter   97.90732242195168
he arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before mercédès with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched say mercédès he said once for all is this your final determination   53.49493433263722
yes my lord replied the young man confused   14.759968306437486
he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face   129.43412042142793
haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile   69.6850698011468
i understand all perfectly sir replied groslow   123.54130946202027
but he is advancing by gap and sisteron   163.05829669644413
but added he looking at d artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness you know what has happened to me   93.445318460277
he was eighteen only three years older than you are raoul when i saw him set to work pitted against tried men   72.44293299912852
scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle a faintness seized him a cloud of blood passed over his eyes and he fell in the middle of the street crying still coward   170.82219261347873
with whom are you going to fight   101.9100755987955
the men are all infamous and i am happy to be able now to do more than detest them i despise them   108.4703015495134
he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night that s all   157.6647282492667
he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces   93.61273967126375
this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his father s residence or in his cabin on board the pharaon   148.59451456301812
can my influence with them be of any service to you   57.937415578028066
does this man know your majesty personally   117.68843765291717
once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the rest   196.47230153123195
exclaimed franz   68.8905247660618
in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us   99.81120523910623
where were we   80.91040564799864
on my word of honor said athos one must be either a mazarinist or a frondeur   108.79794756106463
briefly what did you learn   162.45819087492276
the more so sir as it was men s and not god s doing   20.22670006025875
the cable is cut   131.2207624742357
are you not going to morrow morning at six o clock louis to bathe at conflans   203.45930080268084
the poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy   125.5252054459848
said peppino   67.98714489415164
oh death is in my house   169.47494237227247
for being friends of m   193.96463923429232
am i not to know to whom to present it   139.21833514199713
and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass   160.92797737268245
yes since you have such a good memory   181.15413908883133
mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home   130.95282584336175
de villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty   116.51137150014557
the concierge looked upon the count with surprise   138.48653446049192
you think the count will be angry with me   170.51823180292814
the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket   187.21115575544542
it could not indeed my daughter is her only heiress valentine alone   51.30047633599194
if false let him be shot   127.85526748937266
such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at no   199.04967572491557
replied d artagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed   151.79434650838056
the usurper s conversion   168.09407315911466
here is his receipt   127.10592173456149
valentine colored   161.70314540031075
the queen is my enemy but is not yours sire   91.52808062491987
what have i to fear   124.63307830633956
and pray how did you acquire all these honors   35.55552501352547
this secret which he possessed this woman whom he loved   98.5979975740322
she would not be weary thank god   159.46584494240435
this time i too saw them said porthos   204.47293857361143
but this time our gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived from the love which kitty had just confessed so innocently or so boldly the interception of letters addressed to the comte de wardes news on the spot entrance at all hours into kitty s chamber which was contiguous to her mistress s   183.23848940059705
said richelieu surprised   128.35467444607622
then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned   154.3780390147464
said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties   119.54664529262881
still said the governor i believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that i doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead   152.19437287833483
and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria and took his hands   139.70378928234118
of taste continued franz gravely   133.99068658668764
yes he used to drink a great deal replied porthos   188.1151716187999
how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience   58.91589199208494
d artagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said well monsieur planchet what is the matter with us now   153.38128999083057
my offers did not arouse him did not even tempt him   148.67663242311505
do you perchance think i set any great store by life   168.28101915667006
no from tréport   112.3552242697148
i felt his blood gush over my face but i was intoxicated i was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning me   109.51307418648692
if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queen s service   124.71218558417999
all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of d artagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done before   131.38201212287956
oh yes returned monte cristo   20.79751732756185
that makes ten days   13.887917458918793
yield you yield to me do you not   168.88579388388123
perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars   122.64618886034266
monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz announcing his immediate return   115.44879574329349
that of marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to francis i   51.53153740786371
to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune   86.38931676485475
an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep   54.294757448008355
tell us   109.86628525562486
what are you doing reverend sir   120.70452351483434
yes you re right replied the companion   148.19653628247642
the agitation of caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow   72.52378886008952
in a game of tennis for example   118.02800376786301
we ll wait for you   62.266909646529676
if they should hear of the separation ah yes   46.111608262928556
aramis aramis   101.25138715183492
his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his shoulders   45.19673327158175
arrived in london you will seek buckingham   185.1922655664877
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business   144.7927798675443
why has he not painted a spot upon his heart   28.736294947617793
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris   120.78848098427041
but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have the good fortune to be beloved by you   35.426130660152495
as the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door   48.0737460845027
but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd   144.77271324415324
she had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one child   90.1964287869803
well well dandré said louis xviii   113.8038347839438
monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets   93.78754417620246
d artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent   169.63162611073741
another ten minutes about his daughter travelling with mademoiselle d armilly   120.2573176757221
the name he pronounced in a voice of tenderness amounting almost to love was that of haydée   203.00910383003134
it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke   171.1182028351268
it is not indiscreet returned morcerf with the simplicity of conviction   147.2367499499705
we have undergone a great deal of fatigue remember and a little rest will do no harm   99.21064051109322
cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat   58.7072584019719
and you reply   76.04829776211358
i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen   79.79828831586862
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed   220.8680564151105
why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence   56.38587285903279
but in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the rue de la ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse them   132.946820528356
i took a wax candle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my match box being empty with which i proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers   121.3290331816455
ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves   118.0218126774629
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed   121.028273027586
for heaven s sake where is that   79.60481449518787
ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze   70.14188566991007
the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart   76.07617052167362
where is it then   118.07563187834296
meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours   212.90613497813766
but where is your master   127.59345338626758
they stopped him at the door   161.0376841439641
and d artagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected   138.7520945441906
see they are here   81.19620246495694
well said porthos to aramis we must do something   160.25617961628336
so we opened the bird and this time all special symptoms had disappeared there were only general symptoms   148.77247531014874
but i where shall i go meanwhile   85.03754643713921
i am your majesty s body and soul and however far i may be from you however inferior may be my position i believe i have discovered a means of extricating your majesty from your trouble   68.26571724771058
i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard   192.9513568858037
the chancellor reddened and stammered some words   115.58686027270528
exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs   157.25129961797217
how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine   60.87051137091006
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god   105.03081724828749
franz now listened to it for the third time   147.35184245097764
and what may that be   35.22532110971808
read she said   160.08505975601636
remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after the cardinal myself   186.2373992475366
i won t ask anything more of you   137.95600053213786
what did i tell you   90.50410051480257
should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the pharaon   102.09510770005738
and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder   153.00037535425767
the eight guards were at their posts   61.964375223930524
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense   113.2482436910745
my prince   162.79509290271972
this man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty   51.8180881991181
they sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody   104.58899705548339
the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane   64.39411878778719
i could not ride behind   145.2174825130629
they were in the marvellous dining room before described where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers   99.45767548789416
his thirst had abated   54.156409031860115
and that is the case observed monte cristo   126.27531690388616
patrick soon caught the sound of his master s voice calling his falcon   153.47331739261176
beauchamp chapter 85   29.350536679000257
the count rang and a footman appeared   125.51062380633697
then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison   89.70679638614537
there is the great the distressing truth   107.15029952080576
once for all sir replied the baroness sharply i tell you i will not hear cash named   121.15696589882967
and he rushed out of the room still crying edward edward   153.08990465007145
the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception   111.74384137028947
in an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek   198.49117561062303
and why her rather than another   74.19224302886776
you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous   141.41127941123344
coquenard had seen everything   98.95995263196784
they looked for m   193.9148164955745
it will be happier i think than ours has been   137.6852972765597
my name is mordaunt replied the young man bowing   146.25185818380396
i see how it will be said athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just now   109.44032029063786
yes i insist   127.50362406391861
close to the hedge the steps stopped   117.91358890580702
he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing room and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air   106.39569190672657
well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears us i believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again   101.27132151890808
you will see because you will leave me at the door   122.48542963638326
it is you who with that mandate obtained the pasha s ring which gave you authority over selim the fire keeper   84.7336441630922
my faith said aramis we are all alike   123.8699189571815
the door opened and d artagnan went into the chamber   188.03350858611324
it was necessary to separate   218.58425005038362
gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz   72.91698249188065
said la ramee scratching his head   105.85184692151896
have you business there   35.977117701153205
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again   106.44053802382501
i have made him a spy upon his wife   103.01350582425755
sir cried parry may you and yours be blessed   134.53098250582687
possibly continued aramis came toward me accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him   92.35195159745355
you demanded a favor   97.38323145284889
without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his opera glass and looked another way   100.37355699147354
as yet he could form no definite plan   75.12862062446519
oh they have a house to themselves   133.57533226912815
when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landing place passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return   61.57026761386791
cried the host if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master i am a ruined man   65.5794459040533
40162m rise   63.94443203481666
which he did with the conscientiousness that d artagnan carried into everything   206.36828330870293
alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again   87.73222500579604
but that athos on the contrary would despise him   88.79167323797013
at six o clock villefort retired to his study at eight m   100.10504546065171
what matters it if you avoid them   89.92871190261583
monsieur d artagnan replied athos is in the service   98.59364993167176
nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency s wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber   92.0053755029011
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone   94.85993830499919
holland loved her and she responded to his love   221.58630024679618
i know what happiness and what despair are and i never make a jest of such feelings   160.37280349100539
i never caution my servants a second time remember that   71.8504479086752
athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coachman   130.89291789272195
he gave us some very fine horses   135.2780344275947
well well my dear edmond continued the owner don t let me detain you   111.77122537635988
it was one of the results of mazarin s niggardliness   84.68939193034555
there was a stone veil between him and the firmament   114.31049214775666
silence whispered the duke she has her reasons   229.59484140106707
a carriage was in waiting   127.86308991988513
but since you say nothing remains but for m   94.9658280005964
for i have found the means of strangling this hydra   86.12002657704743
albert cast his eyes on the passport then raised them in astonishment to beauchamp   158.42000686394644
he then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety   151.6711888188123
my friend said andrea i was coming from mortefontaine to senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me   115.14781354965142
in all probability this time his master would not retract   125.30303855475765
you blackguard   151.12901972057387
d artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task   82.82107829052752
has he perceived anything   62.72396343320634
cried his foe   65.37053488203577
oh of the most unfortunate kind monsieur   176.1190667233028
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself   180.76093532512206
dear grandfather   71.26548898379866
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state   129.20234566325118
he darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey   136.25112591865854
athos made him a sign to go to d artagnan s residence and bring back some clothes   85.76964430515598
well this is just what amuses me said monte cristo   113.71579300552749
but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold   118.0112129129462
he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood   126.44776152483442
he wrote the same day for the required information to m   100.02314917155365
is there any answer   171.32910436400812
ah is it you count   47.29194945365791
it is long since we have had a good dinner   96.98901339710508
no said caderousse no   160.7659395216289
d artagnan scratched his ear   92.56479510184198
he is dead and no mistake about it   218.51215978021563
thus speaking he fell back exhausted   60.62512521656315
we have been forestalled   110.18044069596426
they may hear us   45.71718216884001
but d artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses   145.00447191351805
the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials   79.34550602175918
for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey   148.5128557373124
athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter   126.40330909681104
wait a moment said monte cristo   152.08923314032492
it was delightful weather   177.36666744179797
but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity   73.16467024413033
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to refuse   124.20333939556299
i will return soon to learn the result of your trip   90.91899558236204
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold   61.7538709183108
it was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the carnival   123.94553298794648
valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brother in law   84.90912328712197
you are sure of it   173.7126456244889
raoul i seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud   185.4177807407658
the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms   156.81953035451806
are all these crimes committed on his account   137.74288629698714
besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested   22.036015501704995
i was replied the procureur   118.79703563563987
cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry   146.3169266884023
it appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him   41.395033869427365
that is very annoying said the brigadier   91.40567693880578
i will take care of mousqueton said grimaud   68.66602234059917
danglars i do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million   105.73130450495682
for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty   120.21821808943741
the mob dispersed   111.43650932071003
had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave villefort a claim on formed a considerable body   101.57340456482946
olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword   108.64884720983008
go to the devil with your latin   71.38702889522666
i fancy i must have mended that skull somewhere or other   112.20661716075402
the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air   134.2880861048188
albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger   81.69172228221046
he uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse   150.06220812703208
when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost   117.03137960395101
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance   59.83397351600391
i will lay a wager that twas that saint christopher porthos who performed this feat   115.63887134934949
milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years   88.70320159710641
exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture   126.31852144181794
certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of appetite   109.97328607955089
he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day   118.36065931852731
cried all the witnesses of this scene   111.3988612565917
ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter n   138.99183257836268
besides he understands that in my position i can not plead against the poor   43.51807034061599
40286m yes i need your help that is i thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me   86.78427863469464
why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire   89.4202675315806
said the attendant   99.88266919011842
nonsense retorted the baroness   116.6076127249498
then your duchess is still at the waters   47.61309144911755
in that case i should beat a retreat   96.21800745881544
on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair   133.44872333792114
danglars made no reply   184.95150740367856
the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an ill bred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it   146.61060820213945
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay   202.4748084652511
capitally replied m   104.66021778245496
come monsieur bazin make yourself easy said d artagnan   125.86875846125376
i will do better than that said albert   180.058915024441
i do not care where i live said kitty provided i am well concealed and nobody knows where i am   99.92243905607721
the executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his bed   100.26724820950894
sick of the smallpox at his age   102.41225470102347
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time   165.5836026025025
now climb up athos quickly said d artagnan   91.81393222542016
de tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to believe   118.95668116841979
is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering   195.119792793108
have you a carriage   91.38592134500936
they were thus perpetually employed faria that he might not see himself grow old   95.14319222109327
he never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked twice   103.08542584208904
well but he is a charming young man according to my ideas   175.38943526981464
i would rather die a hundred times oh yes die   99.21418262743995
have you anything to ask of me   127.30196128765353
at thirsk replied harrison   140.69275979981336
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress   200.58324660763162
although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him   105.85856444342807
what my horse   95.34172647333273

25th april 149 well   162.40489445999603
he thought they were fighting   86.92611601644012
and you i ve only thrown the fellow down but hark   172.7968023613749
these were the first words he had spoken   134.40861763915944
she was thinking of the despair of maximilian when he should be informed that madame de saint méran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy   167.36163107676413
reflect that i am your wife   88.80959873046291
at first like you he seemed distressed   68.72136536138825
hair black eyes black   91.87007691611038
if this dagger is withdrawn i shall die   54.43689127458312
you said that his majesty king charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects   123.11678753253308
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian   116.33143534431296
franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso   111.9713346492713
you ask what god is doing   63.54709024207088
groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself   93.01509844253005
these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned monte cristo   61.26120149628019
asked mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands   104.37718811153255
here after a short conference they proposed to separate   109.90510984836096
instantly a mask wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance   65.81580051832105
her first movement was repellent   64.90581646638981
asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver   184.72163434798082
and what did you understand by what we said   140.193510711074
dragoons swiss guardsmen musketeers light horsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four friends   103.06096963789264
his complexion was brilliant and beautiful   116.54375176984107
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached raoul   72.37263818469631
tell him that among these four men two only are to be feared d artagnan and athos   32.736751203425314
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him   147.88491258078085
what a horrible face that monk has said de guiche   139.7991686437625
chance did everything   144.12745559500158
none sir replied the bandit you are as free as air   54.324740316788265
and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination   215.5866344074368
the next day he died   172.43098654770355
sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep to night   136.96073649063507
and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths   88.44563919693633
hers had been accomplished   169.40949258761898
yes count you know what i told you   164.51940654171477
ah assunta cried i you are an excellent woman and heaven will bless you   29.4353555093423
well then said mordaunt i choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called comte de la fere calls himself athos   85.19379230004907
but d artagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts   193.04123578306513
at the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the palais royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to cardinal mazarin   68.89100142189682
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect   109.63477160848076
they want to arrest master broussel   170.1532564610579
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions   114.26294068115065
we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board   86.61764363177244
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him   194.88095204653882
but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings   203.01226015593116
i shall go he said to the queen   188.91428611582847
quite possible sir   84.29549124312257
de salvieux who recommends him to me i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously   135.22828020955365
said milady with a last doubt   62.77275206716809
athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms my dear count when one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money   105.87591670776109
my dear albert said debray rising it is half past two   70.58835995997777
i did not understand   78.86181044056741
de tréville saw m   149.60607742107644
it is my mistress you love   130.54685551381144
he knew this was the last struggle   143.42731635284093
i held the horses my hands were full your honor   150.0415593130592
yes said porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two   94.79813425891118
and what am i to do with this young gentleman   95.86026234235715
exclaimed the englishman   163.37539797348197
this time said athos first breaking the silence d artagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once   168.39749635432986
they told me it was 4 500 francs   99.66130728219545
dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress got in by his side   127.02681218483063
for not only is he our servant as you say sir but more he is one of our friends   92.73379951316954
he has followed us several times as i think when i have waited for my wife at the wicket of the louvre to escort her home   124.15816034069286
d avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier   187.53278015970818
was that i saw that i heard   116.24420413530389
he gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any rate   72.52677082566574
it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed and what use i intend making of my strength   89.91120231599994
at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment   68.37953839116064
you arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to a certain point could not dissemble   46.269014450099604
a high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance   214.63529183369872
remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that i do so   156.04013165436112
as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir   160.94414493266865
to ask for an engagement at the opera   141.62495987626625
a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot   128.49140784128164
it is not mercy then that you are about to accord sire it is justice   100.75874457303331
the city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender   132.3828551527395
but this castle then   135.5824460491783
let us start then   137.57530572048586
the fact was that emery s son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed   59.507605616705185
who talks of killing dantès   117.98901338114901
to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward   120.15057609514596
and is her name a secret   96.61454641962142
i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded lucien raising his lorgnette to his eye   48.06619574138897
hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second   5.609531034770399
it was saddled and bridled   131.9326112608139
coquenard was not less affected by it on her part for she added my cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly   232.29733059944297
you are right sir said raoul   201.7503309188348
i also replied mercédès am going and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me   62.188582251178886
athos paused   188.65229091202804
athos took lord de winter s hand and tried to turn the conversation   62.77844726628337
and who were the others   127.61053865882806
i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night   238.39624844318132
for i did not even know of what i was the bearer   178.52995852640436
bertuccio is alone in the world   127.77219307238207
you have asked for me   155.8750542668035
why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair   154.829047321126
we will walk back and forth   26.64024555251021
why you are mad albert   96.75136707027366
happily d artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties   119.57634165077363
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for d artagnan to follow him   195.60170185636207
a positive feast   152.80119561300364
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns   152.8952977853597
he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport   106.05572107538372
this letter told buckingham that the city was at an extremity   86.80268330794715
orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal   114.04661234887139
groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached greenwich   190.70988114254078
20351m i have that honor   46.664745519351186
by what sign to morrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes   119.8769570155741
the lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began   89.11712550296434
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerf s face   170.35193476567935
an instant after bazin made his appearance at the door   70.89366029907875
the count went out first then albert   113.48946011229486
but you say she is english   95.55928402437642
the notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground   116.14896140044654
d artagnan smiled but made no answer   64.61517424932215
said danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me   140.88673482542478
that which was given to me assuredly   172.774322151949
that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers   146.03502461803947
he still felt the same self satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a night s rest   124.4703527772909
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us   137.54590349872535
for a dealer perhaps   150.01784299045227

ah sir he exclaimed it was you   111.35231407096445
for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber   166.52176535547704
the riding horses i entrusted to grimaud and i awaited your coming out which i did not expect till to morrow and i didn t hope to free you without a skirmish   88.98518436430766

doubtless doubtless athos   123.9458815289782
then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step   159.8449924248638
in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them   145.12218651816528

as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all   154.59140390978666
this morning we breakfasted with him   123.94562068630351
leave the box sir   112.97069872697185
as you please said athos   44.02299759413563

i do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me   121.78424478081135
mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it   161.2082479198193
this was too much for felton   166.12774465027877
he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly   184.13325613790312
while monsieur d arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry   94.27797440154521
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch patrol   159.19369266422
the comte de la fere is not a man   125.38860230883674
she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her   72.33475540409584

said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment   84.01434626550859
i suffer from emotion   78.98316672524791
almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me   28.939773262573695
as for porthos on whom d artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute   164.58939820886525
but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one   147.18256438711325

this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them   96.6765333053797

the discourse being finished the queen remained silent   92.16899891558357
for you he said   157.79560458518023
but as to what had been done by porthos and d artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau   91.9323580471156
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut gold   105.01517859230131

you overwhelm me with joy   144.08039293918966
hush we are flying   127.5770992680638
albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend   118.3381714618913

i only ask you a simple question   51.758509186974656
really said athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so   65.97844175871035
d artagnan blushed   142.90406248657297
do you take me for a beggar   143.40338799770427
one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not blaspheme unhappy child the crime is that of your father not yours of your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive   138.30453496201068

and after dinner   109.95577662479319
i am sorry he does not speak french that i might tender him my compliments   127.19794684212806

monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary   113.06445686843868

they both stood in amazement at the door   186.70575402994075
there to his great astonishment d artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into   120.93596997517899
ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda   69.18751377988094

it was planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that d artagnan himself could hardly recognize him   89.852284505906
well he told me that benedetto who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning is really but a very commonplace silly rascal and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death   135.83375469741827

these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long   42.73542138968506
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends   82.68873080924874
but d artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips   123.96102903960504
what would you have sir   180.80899106415848
noirtier at one of the open windows where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony   114.35870247246862

monte cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked   171.4626683569151
all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on   161.76744645229127

but i am unable to leave london for want of money   113.63412924201162
repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness   176.00519859546827
really your manner of speaking it expresses my meaning and that is all i want   94.02794350066735
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls   212.2567187120187
that can only be to hold gloves he said   5.802681014248833
yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy   103.90679356457994

pardieu he has come to draw but i don t know how much   109.8095183697016
these fellows were drunk said athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her door   84.12393405356204

madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head   87.01758903817984
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor   130.0410160912795
i have seen him once replied grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection   67.02149829530984
apropos when do you aspect m   100.28121572660471
the young king leaned toward the door   128.55515289770273
and who is this wretch   85.26572954745683
cried the cardinal with astonishment   77.20324846895542
porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly and shuddered when he felt the knee of the procurator s wife under the table as it came in search of his   129.5801803404043
bernouin said the cardinal not turning round for having whistled he knew that it was his valet de chambre who was behind him   165.62545632109772
if you have forgotten the history of oedipus i at least remember it   109.71837855766177
arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the enemy   55.48177700486936
and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their balls   110.15334056965231
and now continued he you must change your clothes   106.74973704296261
d artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet   72.83720263363142
all the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea   94.05373132362752
but this secret is not mine and i can not reveal it in this manner   137.48138530202255
eh madame who knows   127.22711291671637
danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him   136.1231311536528
but this was not the case   93.4350475373688
you will not sign that order my lord   116.50729072584826
d avrigny which he now examined so closely   117.25126860605435
why are not my frenchmen here   102.07311571703168
before the door the traces were yet more apparent   73.55288027331272
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs   70.53491456670102
there was more than benevolence in this action   80.49720595017835
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room   103.56314363630713
this reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought d artagnan   111.45809290049041
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed   129.85886996697968
it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us but i will believe all you say   132.9296220225183
inquired d artagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse   156.80569487449307
they are going to drag her away cried d artagnan to himself springing up from the floor   79.38086406471626
yes sir replied morcerf   39.94383642187947
but the notes did it injury   167.4523532262977
his opponent stirred not one inch   166.38925147105093
but today i find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700 000 francs per month   125.53254143561185
adieu perhaps farewell   59.82779716620687
at the expiration of an hour felton tapped again   177.94399382434048
as he entered the chamber of his friend dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view   168.29237336580854
when he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk   56.87584090248199
so answered the abbé   104.86974361059572
the queen smiled   120.22986238882237
olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly   111.31014732424184

one terrible idea pressed upon her mind that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again   194.23866713756598
do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes we have seen   6.55399980694682
murmured porthos to himself and then said aloud thank you my cousin i am no longer hungry   175.485435782005
that will give me time to pay him   23.201408561635787
she asked upon what day this fête would take place but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head   52.28093645328526
he asked where their masters were and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn and were then settling their bill with the host   94.95210133647433
you are still growing athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth   100.19775330269357
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived   131.2615075593787
was it you who asked him to drink some of it   134.22023861450285
27 rue du helder paris   66.70621532957381
but what attached him to the cause   130.2049767887518
whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident monsieur bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed   91.43892693907912
i will not have you left alone so long   115.60380723908004
doubtless he has   90.18970717456742
there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this   159.68036989810602
well very good   22.911059789886238
the same impression was experienced by all present and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance   69.74788773030629
we must wait for aramis   176.57076139595478
this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me   105.9350946155378
at whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that i shall be ready to give you absolution   113.64636506774558
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door   74.41313186000086
the count came towards him   79.68002787510629
and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there   109.47523766640975
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and ate   86.10086024700716
i will offer six millions and i will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty   158.2262527654225

in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again   103.70401805228968
that must have cut short the projects of escape   186.27420152615537

valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage and began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress   72.63738778020016
however because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool   94.72082280246767
i have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission   42.544832224080864
then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables   126.44971962753243

what do you say to it   153.90253403070798
nevertheless when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths   141.01689734296082
he walked to the window and looked into the court   98.88553530405804
i mean to ask if you are married   122.00983373815926
so i think   33.719584093040936
oh sir in pity send for a physician   172.61009054614942
if he passes over into france his cause is lost   150.8902122699591
she is not guilty   69.67536068344597
you had begun to pervert my poor felton   87.42156220680351
bind my arms my lord fast   42.745337326899886
whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen anne looked at d artagnan anxiously   161.99782850410497
you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant   117.00555280835657
the men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers   99.78571842727024
said the host in a doubtful tone   46.30628767142534
so much the better replied monte cristo   108.07045349686669
mousqueton s horse which had traveled for five or six hours without a rider the day before might have been able to pursue the journey   166.84674311525617
the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise   195.0563672930025
d artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies   112.25368954225321
he himself had given a plan to bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones   102.40431310446263
when i first came here   108.5336313781731
she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal   94.63556229260125
debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name   187.96634658509046
now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices   51.51476051313557
yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people   129.96735628356592
the principal charge against you is this letter and you see villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed   121.31906550833436
but watch over him   205.62108529311013
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin   71.60384045328095
i have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer   77.2629878128057
in artois where i fought for years   125.1181611012119
no the change in mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit   88.3373827027757
who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested   108.83726225687016
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d artagnan all for one one for all   79.50390747210739
those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people   95.75993801640249
the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor irritated him   139.89568553043668
thanks to the garden we yet can flee   121.2593507321312
what do the people want this time   159.06529692862154
oh yes yes i do sir   212.85698807991002
look closely   100.89196368815254
let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea   118.73592714744535
one of them recognized him   121.61853603981847
the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques   144.2363100670872
lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth   92.67796944844073
the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table   85.32884828584442
ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all this   108.92170694607839
replied d artagnan recognizing athos who after the dressing performed by the doctor was returning to his own apartment   147.72581375463267
it would be unpardonable   152.6389091216516
she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away   60.66261349098121
you will do me honor monsieur said d artagnan   161.51280434499944
i will give you the signal   169.108933548373
let him come in   121.85427115800255
but aramis was livid   95.4068735326448
speak i am ready to obey   70.24113045864578
thanks to something better   81.80751059963737
at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open   100.99819108205745
oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress   147.66418743083224
the people have seen monsieur de condé a prince of the blood royal arrested by my mother in law maria de medicis   45.55798942392161
but wounded without doubt killed perhaps   89.2974277150715
whence came the blow   154.45022896980302
who is this monsieur oliver cromwell   106.31954926665907
i hope i shall gain renée s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me   109.15324717746523
i am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean   65.87802267291653
50073m no said valentine   109.76859101033509
you understand   137.95186624821494
are there not some latin verses upon that subject   212.10301418984992
my friends that s exactly like me   80.09007183573833
she should certainly return from her exile she did not doubt that a single instant   97.53802303400178
the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door   90.38253707910886
you are indeed wonderful men said the king   176.26840203643468
perhaps you had a spy at your heels   179.6503921791919
and what favor pray   154.32466794182932
there are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick walls   204.0976185950296
there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge   69.50128137855324
let us horsewhip the fine gentleman   205.17974683524216
but you do not know how long that arrest lasted   73.87300703491435
that is to say soldiers   144.60938503813355
it is my father who has just left his study   179.22712832603372
certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it   129.70820066409237
mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her   125.96582294774002
yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold   165.03955600488354
cavalcanti as the count s father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave parma at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres   79.5651343369531
oh said the count i only know two things which destroy the appetite grief and as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not that and love   79.0274166091312
here s a rendezvous much more serious than the other   69.52475948574087

15 ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father   169.1906260678956

arrest the duke   98.59899957892024
he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals   88.18299531764134
noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer   60.333177490035624
the duchess was the first to speak   85.22006369180734
you think resumed mazarin that rochefort he was cardinal richelieu s creature my lord   110.94216958629819
thus the day passed away   178.38563890211867
let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and i will say to you rude as it may seem my brother you sacrifice greatly to pride   148.73121760367187
it is something to hit inside the ring   44.428111608800435
go into the cavern with haydée   163.55835247383897
yes i have need of it   181.7319504588378
what was your deputy called   132.4351950332151
how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity   54.91815453505562
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fère all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said   132.76347513394228
he was very successful upon that question   97.1255451975763
on the left was an old abandoned mill with its motionless wings from the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill periodical and monotonous cry   102.44287128782783
himself monsieur bernouin   172.71616890415424
it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim   51.354378210770065
there is the hullabaloo louder than ever   154.61770949676915
his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows   17.106597196491123
madame i never eat muscatel grapes replied monte cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before   111.67226406992289
exclaimed a voice   111.22951242708493
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure   126.86842458992218
all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness   113.19759510431348
her husband is only my brother in law that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me   132.71363792770634
that shoots me said the swiss   130.1570459272881
sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed   80.64260116943552
replied the gascon   49.88473685315732
peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him   195.34970189558334
noirtier stopped him at the last named sum   122.14220541605526
it must have been delirium   176.66543344705184
several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of cucumetto   77.10361509084044
but not before one o clock replied d artagnan   205.03600497873632
exclaimed porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach   133.6118468775023
the cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar manner   185.71935605726247
and who is this friend   22.957610670501012
and the steward followed the notary out of the room   72.85897332555942
what could this treachery be   166.34878069005387
i give you his very words   100.434490596587
at this very moment the court is making overtures to me   119.92703952136237
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents   178.82491197537593
i believed that madame loved him   115.48134450066178
oh i recollect him perfectly cried m   150.38704034593303
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock   161.65218706984268
four men one of them wounded and a youth say you   59.16125939577659
their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss   94.7626423122442
adapt your promises to their respective characters   143.04330236727657
have it your own way   160.5954350080708
in the position in which raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters   74.45881188015528
i am hungry that is all   58.61221172244923
and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor   88.47027207844836
in fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of st   59.828412184312846
but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep   168.58158404152425
i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which i in my pride pronounced   178.20228601208257
monsieur de st   22.48867982380311
you know that   98.17806520416252
george villiers placed himself before the glass as we have said restored the undulations to his beautiful hair which the weight of his hat had disordered twisted his mustache and his heart swelling with joy happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for he smiled upon himself with pride and hope   51.473888590573736
i became very pale   80.3835529744729
still at the hotel of the great charlemagne   136.4761595588485
you ought then to have a good hand   75.03625718326184
and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten   80.49814452925365
red and black tapestry such was the appearance of lord wilmore s drawing room   53.02456460366539
i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background   131.21484037395336
do so madame do so and that at once   107.88781580953054
they talk of making him an ambassador   103.8337339392113
ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes   80.94434003799428
she said i saw but i can not believe   72.82073272378102
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m   98.16769101244995
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it   145.46339549580156
do i wish to follow it   46.281232847444144
so little was it a dream that i stretched my hand towards the bell   107.7512824898742
no i said very well sir you have gained the victory   125.966967935063
nothing for the present   123.31811370618207
in fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the king s closet opened and m   134.85841790927518
let me see what time it is   103.38763141731783
but she exclaimed suddenly arsenic is indelible indestructible   98.24860522098906
and where is it   192.42213551976596
humiliating as such a confession is i am   127.81997912678389
undeniably   153.0381864020551
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room   2.4439132692690038
the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation   123.40817978161792
my clerks are honest men who earn my fortune whom i pay much below their deserts if i may value them according to what they bring in   65.40077426346858
for different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all and it was therefore agreed that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating house in the rue de la monnaie of the sign of the hermitage   129.62254269497188
disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart   168.6790256092386
monsieur le vicomte knows that i never joke   41.46979352777153
i wish i were on board already and he looked back again   148.76712970142557
porthos agreed to the bargain   167.50513782709453
but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said château renaud   139.13589092020865
without seeing mademoiselle valentine   100.40171053305461
isn t this fox a genius athos   128.24893351097725
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs   104.24695006428777
indeed when placed beside m   72.04740369227275
cried renée clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal   161.8740496177112
so now i breathe again i am happy   81.65999413750751
the one with a white dress and so many diamonds the fair one   36.889596370789874
she descended and went through the passage   131.00158992042418
so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both   60.08227394776502
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes   45.20756056681449
at eleven o clock came in his turn duhallier captain of the guards bringing with him fifty archers who were distributed immediately through the hôtel de ville at the doors assigned them   83.18126576545522
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy   115.66470870267001
can i not escape   91.64107583058554
i think it is the wind   172.91097707003414
she draws only fifteen feet   80.13713784397305
de tréville s as nine o clock had just struck and as planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task a knocking was heard at the street door   64.23182414041618
grimaud in fact brought back five horses   154.76361494009382
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears   147.73627330605427
asked dantès with much surprise   61.423004373729356
but d artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship   91.71911197436617
the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor do you see it there   133.14468621595583
but i who saw him in his dying moments i say he died of caderousse paused   31.30767745847281
if one has it not one must do without it   167.07532673937894
but listen at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing a tempest from the fronde did blow to day i think twill blow sieur mazarin away   126.20808255351969
after which the cardinal who had been informed that d artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him took leave of the king inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke   64.38726664965986
it closed after him with a spring   114.73945242669168
they found raoul near his tent reclining on a truss of hay of which his horse stole some mouthfuls   110.6305454717979
athos himself stared   123.63432106431658
the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his self control change color once or twice   116.55687148879234
half past one only   228.3449485819627
she murmured to herself then said aloud d artagnan   96.34618094668112
mousqueton trembled   183.5438121525429
in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter   161.9450796989218
it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion   91.95823507588639
ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening   154.30222826608835
d artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers   172.15507149158756
yes sir he had very good ones   201.46556563745514
mazarin replied only by a groan   162.9219163756425
i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about   79.58739035054012
her self control however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm   131.4317864138663
they will come in due season   98.43174180299869
bonacieux his name age condition and abode   85.30335517767024
instead of being astonished let me dress myself   150.2936147850228
you will find him quite enthusiastic   132.328425239019
and d artagnan gave feature for feature a description of the comte de wardes   157.32168691178873
the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples   154.84024679908296
mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match   154.39991710853167
he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin d or   114.01706052344953
thanks monsieur returned monte cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre   129.32714611878657
well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together   163.86394442453792
with this needle said the abbé as opening his ragged vestments he showed dantès a long sharp fish bone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it   146.28480346616524
do you know that i am to be beheaded outside this window   152.16260928347572
oh were i not a foreigner   96.3963925477772
some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two   69.4533876749674
the king is really very handsome said porthos   139.07837950180257
said he to himself misfortune is over my head   66.17742871741928
de tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d artagnan to render the king any signal service or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action   7.959423242537568
i am satisfied with having killed that fellow my boy seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an englishman   180.17441209427517
he opened his eyes   105.86887442294592
said monte cristo feigning uneasiness   75.03055998342165
his story however had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things   201.67286024368389
we are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass   163.38973945394315
now said athos that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the king s entrance   118.10066789262329
you are right madame and i will not finish   132.3036583019029
i have seen him eat of everything in italy   98.53724194629682
i would almost answer for planchet   163.7559768898223
we are discovered   97.48795908341617
i die after my own manner i die exhausted and broken spirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell that is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues   91.50910819483477
was it ali asked the count of morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits   101.88635147052543
the last month s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude   101.19261983437848
you will not allow that   120.04182639787933
excuse me abbé said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very much   128.9841108959036
when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely   65.895474936534
and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied   22.65974147699403
i bless and love you my dear son   133.00399491572418
still more   148.5813185954679
is there anyone in the lobby   138.9932570868988
acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and i will hand you over the money   176.89419261123186
said d artagnan looking at aramis as he had looked at athos   148.79627875034242
said julie   139.83004639091692
now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door   117.29527098459471
i saw the executioner return into the king s room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear   75.3447481229691
alas no sir replied andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former ones   119.82346668920836
the four young men waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour twenty minutes   105.96378318979967
gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice i must name myself   134.3099529426105
and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt   97.29676096583404
and although i was certain he was at home he would not make any answer   76.68239019782499
well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left   126.21996507855803
five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard   90.10142785985603
yes my mother said albert i will return and woe to the infamous wretch   137.6914034831559
i will set before him the example of madame de morcerf and her son   120.36041474293593
you were no stranger to me for i knew you from the time i gave up two rooms to you invited you to breakfast with me lent you one of my carriages witnessed the carnival in your company and saw with you from a window in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted   106.73646705570602
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them   39.516200682744625
and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed i don t know how many rochellais   152.47232002784796
he took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote my dear marshal in an hour lens will be in the enemy s possession   88.06355895176611
then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it   142.61237891945115
de tréville the elegant and noble courtier athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison   50.1678265078576
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villefort s departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind   148.89631170810466
but in either case what is to be done   101.43754131392835
but let us first sit down to table for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready   144.96336272158797
a man was hidden in lafitte s banking house behind one of the little arched windows which are placed above each desk   65.52658237335118
i will keep it for myself   89.57423448680821
do not believe what albert is telling you countess   63.88191973642756
that is an important point do you understand   75.95986252000395
he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines i bequeath to maximilian morrel captain of spahis and son of my former patron pierre morrel shipowner at marseilles the sum of twenty millions a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother in law emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness   123.62670905310443
she departed last night   100.89989399928172
but they may catch him yet   192.78843808703698
he simply wrote nothing to be done   97.94765544198938
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtier s expression than by valentine s indisposition   193.7153520415685
what was   196.99867228442716
said the banker   75.51883452894543
but though he hadn t strength to speak he had enough for action   48.350067470805854
nay said the count   152.9577357671879
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare   106.95095450455887
i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible   56.69501644801927
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st   174.27614521909595
in fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half hour   100.03730684596863
that is enough   110.00483350169492
he was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his hand   98.88322793057091
yes certainly added athos and the other two   129.6985867997587
not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps   123.11215528166682
yet you have need i believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken   118.7752091092545
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away   154.0827475937397
when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are   67.89379230000824
i shall pass over them   157.43582437668172
but deuce take me if i understand at all   125.77097256971958
you may make your mind easy said the doctor   57.02341227821645
don t you agree with me aramis   92.65374481010024
d épinay can not leave the drawing room at present   160.99274146667773
ah yes i understand said mazarin   105.83973424629215
franz continued the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m   143.2815200865154
you do not wish to hear it perhaps   156.37446442378058
you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can live   115.20002221003992
athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles   99.45694640017999
dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth   101.26757089318573
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons   121.35894750627355
and if you were at rome the house of thomson french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done   102.49280948091841
de monte cristo has only shown us kindness   118.59712456671527
mazarin is better lodged said aramis   159.94294976259715
silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them   99.33774684306131
he did well   116.45095843415147
nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression   160.81649740239263
that house is one inhabited by my friend and that friend is aramis   114.06666803255646
i have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful   113.36855799737589
and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles   89.09539111999656
yes yes continued lord de winter i understand   48.347384672184035
i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you   175.26549602265015
so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it   112.83575489764087
i fear it   120.40958940679492
however we shall see   32.888567389842095
i choose that which the red headed boy is leading   96.0826537879465
indeed sir said andrea i assure you i have never given the subject a thought but i suppose it must have been at least two millions   86.94409745534335
leave all to me   101.81560982155563
that was that he should kill me   48.94081798470981
it fit his finger as if made for it   85.23872742606295
the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky   45.09593019521195
and do you understand them   134.83932681223948
women are very indiscreet my sister   115.02911022329606
or should we pause   169.25614123885205
on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable wife   161.68716831040615
what are his means of existence   191.32316406446904
but i have not seen your father   67.65517448925006
then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for me thanks   146.89004428489864
when one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under it   78.11017064681897
the king looked around him   28.451243678640452
22 now in passing through this room andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him   51.73486612124649
in france   126.01724615806249
i have a son   69.33907686346629
well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen   81.48233504412252
oh really   75.08397422217575
thank god thank god   134.74822321002281
the three friends for as we have said athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himself went out early in the morning and returned late at night   78.52900407578679
there only his memory returned to him   176.01403657398325
you are strong among the strong mordaunt he said   8.310821650882332
he s gone right by the road to the vieilles infirmeries   116.44921620677987
not to be found   144.12805711143014
they had arrested him for the purpose of robbery and as he had only a few louis about him he doubted not he would be ransomed   161.31892113067778
it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me but for my security   157.7639778302885
cried the poor tutor   221.4034668075746
since said d artagnan they have friends who ask it for them   71.54981661379907
you see madame how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here   89.35211426026223
well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me   121.59431196241714
i must tell you resumed mazarin that it is in a double envelope   58.795488760458696
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara   160.36503940154267
now sire resumed aramis listen to me   144.65402361935816
and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully   170.8277996964364
then i shall really have them   88.57846337316874
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled   12.417640198002019
she had not even one little flower she whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics   126.29177330617901
so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon where m   146.86173517722028
d artagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away   110.00485487556081
i have not said good morning to you monsieur d artagnan he said   168.13344160225935
their halberds were leveled at him threateningly   125.0012309100718
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them   91.51186498036216
as for denying that i am your nephew you will think twice about it now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year ago   96.87176820499761
then i am also a puzzle to your mother   83.41301767170259
he is an admirable man said the major   52.00071091638489
but nobody replied to him not even an echo   157.42834026702081
our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o clock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since   80.66648184013498
still five days before us   178.10301123588948
monte cristo felt his limbs tremble   58.773728026553854
tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out   134.6457269560409
it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true   68.01646837246419
because it has instilled a new passion in your heart that of vengeance   17.220111556025458
she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward   128.61375353692682
i am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter   56.59044276988248
oh mercédès i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair   81.72128065699582
chapter 83   85.18902183696507
he says he is german my lord replied raoul   107.24914965448264
indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose   151.0202169488045
man proposes and god disposes   76.70838297746945
it is possible that the influence of the place the charm of the beautiful evening the fascination of your look the thousand circumstances in short which sometimes unite to destroy a woman were grouped around me on that fatal evening   132.64518062415982
yes i   75.94563480895994
then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons   124.79798016968591
edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided   109.30180525363573
franz entered the hotel   139.76569937571065
he is in a very picturesque place do you know the catacombs of st   127.94309431982894
and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by léopold robert   55.640807696074496
she likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you   144.6856301042352
milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted   102.14902728234865
cried mousqueton the man you upset is getting up   159.55864157116466
villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter after all the disclosures which were made this morning m   76.41699203221785
there monsieur there is that letter   153.89013303737337
i remember that at the castle of rueil the cardinal richelieu had some horrible oubliettes constructed   128.29989461836553
noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter   111.21461831934484
but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality   9.325710571765995
but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming   81.39570932835149
but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you   175.89077654064442
let me overtake him   175.24979552855052
but has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel   105.13415324528262
but you would do better still by not going at all   7.948842912093113
said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me   200.10795080881263
the arrest of montague   143.62608555519688
je crois qu il gronde contre le mazarin   136.2592507341511
a firm and well practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond   129.52317184139395
to whom is it addressed   93.09940164073679
did you ever hear of such an idea   85.54882774300953
the three friends uttered a cry of surprise   112.91045045002076
mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door   90.79066314293414
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him   116.82855218326365
well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed d artagnan i will go without you   159.38482031978702
valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in noirtier s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind   105.82660806983476
i am not referring in the least to matrimony and i only addressed myself to m   86.25041916050446
to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense   99.14659054663117
there was firing nevertheless i heard he said   144.49608812915463
trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart   151.12547241173925
but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment   80.45694362448776
to lift their hands against a minister of god   164.15916502876462
cried the procurator s wife bursting into tears   166.2962506604576
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them   78.84409164649666
debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her debray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he   134.47992305897552
formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter and shielded by their birth   76.0681660291099
then in order not to hinder you i will get up with you if you please in your carriage and tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow   93.53132409585498
now i travel a great deal particularly on this road and i wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune   50.46405082847241
your emotion has quite overcome you   176.58147313950974
for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear marie   129.24009445183512
you are fond of gardening   66.50821820052965
this menace smothered the young man s passion   187.38488309203967
i don t know much about it said athos   9.752326133333469
friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts d artagnan   108.11015007429563
20269m yes i do remember replied the countess   114.51605603911878
three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear   137.02654050975866
you see my strength fails me   57.551474456215615
then he has neither the parliament nor the people with him they represent the wealth of the country   169.77848616514902
no count of monte cristo added debray   90.56227506647453
debray had told you ah yes   78.523672523778
his desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever   127.30594513802575
yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in italy   199.14955503589306
and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by his   123.71587357154594
with the deputy s knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence   110.57279445610897
and the senator s robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him   157.41163272127486
and what was the end of the affair   70.46222628819115
section 5   93.0995463228288
where is raoul   103.06403527016333
ah forgive me said valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian i have done wrong for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart   93.63318363199895
this woman is one of the cardinal s spies i am sure of that   195.1103276826152
those of the marechal de villeroy guitant villequier and comminges came into the line   108.81378456826889
the audience chapter iv   50.95629153749152
has the queen any further commands for me now   104.20294070366423
athos sighed deeply   171.53117280152262
they were surrounded by a crowd of people who opened a way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these words this is the head of ali tepelini pasha of yanina   141.24158048277863
as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight as many as my lord wishes   121.60551750440281
to my great regret mordieu   104.08461692823627
the favorite of two kings immensely rich all powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice george villiers duke of buckingham had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive in the course of centuries to astonish posterity   90.15569360718789
nothing is more simple   64.16316649683652
no i use your generosity that s all   150.02403910301734
the absolution   105.22988360560366
morrel in demanding justice for crime   24.59328199979305
but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap   86.20016589392773
not so bad yet replied athos   24.79944981690207
without waiting for my coming out again   85.15297827341158
the fifth of september chapter 31   93.06208400011046
ah that would be easy enough i would give her a lesson   111.1319611008923
aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room   92.04354273967954
yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled   103.51689358291377
is he a sure man   28.427608584053388
let us go and embrace raoul   95.11001676832596
he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant   127.42887011620047
suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and grimaud uttered a shout of joy   78.13655202285264
morrel had agreed to meet him   131.49819368805066
what you ask is impossible   53.391389756006234
so much the better for him he will suffer less said the inspector   109.63913281602304
will you drink some of this ether and water   58.33295951650963
she was walking with her nurse marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback i stopped   94.92696475476464
where does he come from the end of the world   164.95589924990244
sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor   172.77845322635517
come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger with us   130.3976728746801
and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied   144.497474327323
my sword is shorter than yours it s true but bah   74.04151192445659
by that letter which my comrade has in his pocket   161.5227091607291
that is the reply i beg you to make to lord de winter   188.99352103805626
she rose   131.87266672495048
perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself   136.11191954165187
i can not throw the loop through this partition nor move with a pack thread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred pounds   123.15454036223585
and if the fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the fronde must triumph   19.653295107555962
what said athos no fish at a seaport   58.45164692829319
and you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others   130.45466870672286
edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love   26.037269745121137
yes that was it said d artagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue eyes   85.81571061245737
it follows from this that the king s attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should   117.56709316063825
your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it   152.56802610752516
to avoid meeting him my mother and i left town   84.85758785400574
this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his part in it   114.00224941190292
your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news   89.57439226835756
i used to play almost every night in france   126.04064048738024
d artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister who thus open handed sported with men and millions   53.73497418087065
by heavens exclaimed monte cristo starting back it is ali raised his hatchet   176.63048882960447
106 and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker   84.228403501093
he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo   100.76372935275033
a child   126.30516674619979
that is to say those who were called   125.06712030955867
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent   82.050309341971
trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another   73.45771618189869
pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively   182.08931708466594
you are then a chemist   170.84132591944837
fernand smiled piteously   169.07215939081422
in a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the count   78.78085315357464
no was the old man s reply i will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world   90.40928197310497
de tréville to the others as may be perceived   130.13837294226667
monte cristo in taking the seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there   148.22099896016618
what have they done to you   90.91204903229782
and i think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you   118.38983331866376
yes says he   107.49337128666329
knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by   197.156634465173
enter marseilles at night and your house by the back door and there remain quiet submissive secret and above all inoffensive   86.68184965938973
at ten o clock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter   123.06147733895563
porthos bowed to his friend   109.61745806540992
moreover he had this advantage he was master of the count s secret while the count had no hold on franz who had nothing to conceal   134.17409714935454
i should be sorry to advise you in the matter   96.66012047710836
he will speak to me of god and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public charity   159.33231639378067
but there was more difficulty in arousing porthos   94.34900107942023
with a full heart and burning head he desired olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had reached   132.4057694741841
here i am said he   49.898044304759125
well and what does it signify whether it was he or i   161.30441825487532
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it   133.75264650547382
demanded milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness   179.85277377099698
ah true a diplomatist   42.11644972274962
i will not make a confidant of him   141.4031597757819
and i for my part have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry i confess to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old burgundy   39.73767500347054
neither can we procure horses   147.99362604882901
we have the gates   118.651459412155
the aperture was finished and athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the king s room   58.368112438306404
thought d artagnan in this direction i am satisfied   108.36259111166056
if on the other side it was not she which was still quite possible for the little light that remained rendered a mistake easy might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman for whom his love was known   125.55761987703356
what fault do you find with the fellow   167.0128109879623
and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom i gave them   246.9031359824389
we shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance   34.744102154888864
the days of expectation are long and d artagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were forty four hours   119.92397122033496
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenant s sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak   76.3895196634753
each time you have applied to me said the doctor it has been too late   103.53869679760692
and my wife on her part has sworn to me by all that s sacred that she does not know   177.7591569474466
nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you   76.61869914999903
nearly nine o clock why i shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight   136.77602546186782
how had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized   97.88859892188123
and what is the origin of this name   102.61817117115142
but what danger threatens him then emmanuel   164.7824094598526
ah said morrel one quits a dungeon in a week a month or a year   88.16125507063488
you are always in the right my dear friend cried porthos   57.06688995314657
two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mention the viscount de bragelonne   142.7843346898356
for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened   157.1057735968172
you have brought me something   137.1962489061279
to morrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton   88.45919570272216
yes it is i my uncle i the son of milady i the monk i the secretary and friend of cromwell i know you now both you and your companions   73.52756033183626
her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared   102.44231980218075
but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of d artagnan cruelly mystified him   143.9114020652188
d artagnan who was accustomed to his friend s manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took athos s arm and went out without saying anything   147.7248921633273
come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other   83.31877114475893
d artagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier   158.98102156079466
it would be fatal to his interests   140.77484987686898
teresa was lively and gay but coquettish to excess   32.47378523621681
but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men   146.57545964700853
more than ever   144.71251609099096
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag   86.23186416285583
i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say   100.18395956214349
she possesses all earthly seductions   100.13581069500754
as soon as this organization was established they set about driving the english from the isle   138.50029664823927
well said rochefort taking the paper from milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be easy   130.70538121318705
and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son   238.00555125510283
lead me to him   111.62272385520538
ah to see me   108.77110434631781
the queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of the fête to the pleasure she had experienced in the ballet   100.29991943157455
to cours la reine   31.6016775200615
flattery was at that period very current and m   139.0525666723457
this devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head   135.9732980457375
i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent   89.01114302771455
he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him   72.8686471828139
but let it be done explicitly and positively   84.7419785449739
the queen saving us her friends   82.17103862160562
bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into lorraine or belgium   145.03640895465207
i ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants   140.04785530502767
cried the man in the skiff   85.39173000370292
d artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation   46.68918322402992
very good observed danglars after having read the paragraph   113.84580981825941
but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on morrel s breast   59.963562106384586
except you athos who never had one   154.69646599007066
they were numerous and inauspicious   123.56213171661031
yes horse   130.57603552981865
the natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage life   110.76443443555364
when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers   125.34293420270231
now that i have the word of athos i can set out   83.06549553071063
to preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procureur   65.76247483736529
had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of   68.04562774434075
at this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that master broussel was at home and at dinner   123.20659413294501
de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal   174.2492486800462
dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea   85.7367242586536
there remained then no other place to fear but the traitor s cross   121.29991629057525
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter   110.82950973601592
dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty   129.60623647716
the latter smiled   103.10617907311617
let the man go d artagnan   38.45158019560621
but one evening about five o clock our little cabin boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom house officers advancing in our direction   120.19013472649036
because he has made his will in my favor   102.68417702549047
murmured the monk shaking his head   96.26797702693008
from avignon to marseilles seven francs   51.66886042517066
one day however an emissary of the cardinal s gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often   61.86731869208994
they proposed a game of bouillotte   94.55176047907862
yes said madame de villefort   55.10413747498959
retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces   116.86526048509953
valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time   155.3291855060896
were they then so necessary   106.1167992325223
really if the house had not belonged to the father in law of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed   38.69821247794316
what do you want me for sir   119.36218360765088
her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor   147.99824671975819
listen said the young man to the sentinel   139.24720812552863
said milady placing a bag full of louis in felton s hands   96.21455851219257
she only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm the fair round arm of a woman but twenty five years old and who yet spread death around her   174.58642786029935
oh yes she exclaimed i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching brain   105.11505407349777
all at once i see you pass through the barrier with a groom a tilbury and fine new clothes   221.9351193652561
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly   89.0955325233179
fortunately the reader may remember or may not remember fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him   122.92860327656962
she declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war   134.84423270699102
but you answered porthos seem to me agitated   158.23355760049265
he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for   156.105393381299
you can come he said and led them back to noirtier   161.2332052572657
but then athos would tell that she was branded   112.93003043890616
well then a happy and merry life to you   50.00126077377155
come in come in said morrel for i presume you are all at the door   97.8514233284659
luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up with   165.7322348084652
well replied the latter blushing what must i say   140.6057385963013
well then i appeal to m   81.80645267833026
cried selim   45.008688872555766

lastly her hair which from being light in her youth had become chestnut and which she wore curled very plainly and with much powder admirably set off her face in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose   60.022809684297904
we say aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior   94.02247001171926
but i hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in consequence   139.5179356191792
chapter 26   95.66344116008547
he cherished the thought of the duel hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds   72.43713665917818

your mother will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam which she had from a bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach the heart   194.56956083201243
the young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horse s head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud   135.55943735826875
it was four o clock when dantès was placed in this chamber   94.70360171747069
i passed the day and the night in prayer for i hoped that god would pardon me my suicide   158.71797861186246
what can have happened then to bragelonne   136.07613278850587
mazarin groaned   82.41752574768282
with what ideas does that letter inspire you   133.4125194589215
tell your coachman to stop at the door   164.3375913144136

believe me dear albert he said with all the emotion he was capable of feeling believe me i feel deeply for your misfortunes and if in any way i can serve you i am yours   55.5520513185584
make way for us planchet said d artagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive   97.60000124633483
what have you seen   125.1548371960903
well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject   39.107371561021196
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately   83.26015564341196
day was just dawning   56.909081226067315
the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage   96.4023689201395
three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her   90.82793014890083
words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors   91.83408417341826
you can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than speak   124.24342615855254
there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the count s manner   196.29496743614862
if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices   142.8691512565186
it is more it is magnificent   95.8167348787489
a terrible vision the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a moment   123.6070960548151
said louvieres   94.71229236549534
let things take their course   16.87209619494523
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs   69.13267735526641
the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la ramee   104.35654956616955
bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the louvre that was all   52.037401489338905
and i will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to death   95.27136889761996
monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy   173.66338504667985
if you will permit me i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient masters warranted as such   127.02295760417766
d épinay said he allow me to remind you at this moment which is perhaps not so ill chosen as at first sight may appear for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by madame de saint méran on her death bed that valentine s wedding might not be deferred   20.525669352256315
and after this reasoning she slept easily   89.94528232620097
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there   92.34350708835224
a trade   101.60515486574458
but this war may bring round a peace   104.3197761114175
we left paris each with seventy five pistoles in his pocket   75.47392088527289
grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk   90.18229598487719
i know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch i know not every page of my life   92.24364518175803
if you be a priest i conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man   117.09889075762341
monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince   135.0002754042578
the jailer always brought dantès soup in an iron saucepan   149.3870367583341
i am still beautiful   72.03673379111486
now grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed   80.49310006416147
besides her majesty had said ladies wait for me and she did not dare to disobey the queen   160.21403089288327
well signor pastrini said franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi vampa   181.9687177107766
free to leave me   162.5706483805489
but do you understand   41.9161034984036
a saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter   68.15131429337546
this mystery required an explanation   195.80379176491667
let me think a moment   137.72810551905712
said mercédès passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration   25.182433105499427
and you say that by his will he leaves me five hundred thousand livres   155.19532345348102
her mouth was mute   97.81057398994592
you see i am obliged to economize in case your prosperity should cease   81.27063113297152
then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman   180.4831805159282
i not only promise but swear it   79.98830869442534
valentine whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily   49.930426378262396
i know it from my wife monsieur from my wife herself   76.84497979649564
yes she is still beautiful   176.69647676257074
suddenly d artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even porthos observed   124.39163033693514
that would be to denounce herself   96.7856502573577
you were saying this were you not   135.91099134514005
i have been so for many days   81.99907568535372
eugénie covered her face with her hands   136.87283907088437
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman   20.917405151164544
he had taken the lady as far as fromelles   40.187580564733224
de saint méran madame de saint méran m   90.8659480806887
two hours after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded   113.04730017273093
20303m ah said monte cristo the evening of the 3rd of june 1829   81.61960783426517
i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars   126.03612410172464
he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire   89.69331348492864
you are irritated and vexed tell me how this fernand is related to you   80.86228524626443
i have no hope of penetrating sword in hand to paris i know that well   107.78426970580165
the second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the musketeer upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword   95.04067237695723
the prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queen s generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure   106.75800173651623
at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid   18.364995482748853
i think i understand his reason said morrel   98.35691495717047
how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame   121.7417099568308
i fancied myself despised betrayed   163.1779679989608
but my mother no not my mother   123.43850025778715
at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed   81.03843304657029
not very said valentine   81.14970584961995
everyone listened eagerly   138.28893612330992
are the english expected by land or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers   131.40469992028312
a hat with wide brim and a cane   209.57953145228078
too late by a minute   215.19020952157797
the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the forty eight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape   69.84883980769678
with what an air he says all this muttered beauchamp   76.16360835778087
said athos filling his glass and that of his friend   130.31712219880018
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him   139.42676964780185
we found the pasha calm but paler than usual   155.51304643256103
valentine the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere   142.46679031928585
ah pardieu tréville   85.29775916090446
there may be   108.2824652163105
they merit richly that piece of attention on your part   147.59582226285806
but you know that god who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned   141.34927049873758
but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500 000 livres   127.65820768902617
and am i not a hundred times better thus   108.80740190952447
but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever i may be you shall be welcome   69.66174914894273
what did you do then   89.33270251365073
what do you want me to do   128.91115338212612
but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for that   104.35976777197888
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenant s heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth   133.23727510880127
cried d artagnan and do you suppose i suppose monsieur that you are not a fool and that you knew very well although coming from gascony that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason   128.51904814231742
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted   89.73370775219672
lord de winter perceived nothing of this   140.71293242732673
while retracing the past i forget the present   185.20536135650332
he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament   114.10098058933524
and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt   128.85911584552048
the result was that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators   166.05319835252132
beauchamp left the box perfectly amazed   66.13022025055847
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage   117.09319631222465
said caderousse who drank as he spoke and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect under any circumstances fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of dantès   93.34813853496793
he rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window   157.0836504431654
come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded   59.05907501650035
at two o clock   115.54091241341568
swear   119.21442940768287
d artagnan a little recovered from his first surprise had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy   142.17849400997096
no pardieu no   97.71198426857381
so far so well answered planchet alighting and extending his arms to mousqueton the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that planchet was a great lord in disguise so highly did they estimate the position of mousqueton   142.61462123298855
la mazzolata gentlemen said the count of monte cristo as he entered i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated   117.64340355323529
i am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the ground   95.41709422682199
carlini s teeth clenched convulsively   174.05605538071143
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london   178.53107640466877
if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba   126.57491832078702
well said franz to albert do you know what is the best thing we can do   82.04666680196036
besides the parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few days   76.64358986699708
d artagnan s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract   165.79149881764246
having given this vent to his ill humor the baron became more calm   160.2884347722354
if you do not take great heed they will destroy you   140.30171342519907
you forget that i am her best friend   102.98362009525157
monte cristo reflected one instant   130.10119700655486
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy   57.6986403402841
the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his side not from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation   70.9120309426606
yes a telegraph   119.34810395212705
the challenge chapter 88   160.50228448705758
under the name of athos   114.26652001033106
nothing was changed   147.68364421528898
why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal   126.65459521624172
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue   99.85067658400511
olivain said athos showing the servant raoul s shoulder belt tighten the buckle of the sword it falls too low   62.13007788157383
carefully closing the box door ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian   239.91740864040835
well he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom   140.80602271616007
a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams   123.56875554352919
but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters   175.57090171655435
and an inquest in my house impossible   147.1587750817139
said lord wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of great britain   110.80975405082582
this man was our old acquaintance gaspard caderousse   12.523591992512436
oh you may speak before his excellency said he   68.90496725549002

yes a horse   141.02792189022858
on our arrival in paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said porthos   160.78450008404803
madame de saint méran s last request was that the marriage might not be delayed   67.17485905199999
you seem incredulous said monte cristo who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french   136.6577650539886
albert kissed his mother s hand and drew near the count   95.03543055653903
we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man   193.6472707065473
is all safe m   117.5334692412953
grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled   151.82455924552687
how much may it amount to   194.79441120164503
nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in paris   149.870057104701

dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities   236.00582476473514
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal   163.90823804510293
come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed   67.34511469302083
quite so said albert if the way be picturesque   113.76134583145223
mordaunt recoiled   162.27557018598526
of course you know you can do so   101.4196023652558
d artagnan and planchet mounted and took the road to st   125.71426143708338
but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the musketeers   130.391889486729
it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count   113.81318731322865
wait a moment sir said he   138.79350683218613
planchet and bazin came last   115.8823577577627
cocles went first and the stranger followed him   41.700890859106764
the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain   136.7356461537288
yes she said at your advice i have made the trial   148.1981810742649
true but some day they do them justice   140.5320735943355
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of   147.1468703347507
and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier   135.66522963734164
asked the duke uneasily   0.5398791134602021
but nowadays they are not inviolable   138.30422187901007
how could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many men   108.26876452578247
thought milady   76.71429661003182
i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before   146.58139351117885
i could not bear to see her suffer   138.04959435509565
oh sir said danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him three letters of unlimited credit   132.6520050006869
where have you come from my dear count   176.73116635623893

no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening   87.33469402152281
and did my husband know i had been carried off   55.09389685846852
caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn   134.96371741744008
oh chevalier   42.24188109829909
about six or seven and twenty years of age i should say   114.29206635115474
i have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours and by tomorrow at midday i must be in london   89.89862826902552
holà aramis   170.1761552128958
if i am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the league and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much   195.91552643003817
he instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met de rochefort   93.16627629793099
he glanced around in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn and seemed to fall easily on a topic   136.2014854171186
do not quit his salon until you have seen me   72.32758554378054
then today madame oh today i am no further than gratitude   63.604584674634616
when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o the wisps that play about the marshes   65.43516158597279
they do indeed   121.5938802702355
ah monseigneur   204.24737975908852
no monsieur no   129.49662634392476
mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all   165.4148284433563
they were untouched   161.90500172472335
oh father   40.175716425816375
but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity   113.19547875713347
this lasted several minutes until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished   112.20688937557578
de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face   120.08317886859305
that our sentinels have seen this movement and i have been left unacquainted with it   54.721005328552856
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger   33.89407385802889
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes watering pots hung against the wall   127.94360949425665
fight the more for duels being forbidden since consequently there is twice as much courage in fighting   99.31643774061601
to this question de guiche could not respond   104.68557202349179
yes sire said aramis yes you are right   48.92525396114999
twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret   143.71683098877284
no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain   148.62008000188308
porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished   125.0116913478422
said lord de winter to felton who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the sea   108.54710657271619
here begins the trial   117.17543716359128
give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good   130.2552521992665
what were you saying   95.49138190939485
farewell my son said the curate till tomorrow   119.78676929156941
if he comes   118.40524106268876
i asked after you and came up as soon as i could   108.24400225622605
they must disappear broken scattered annihilated   30.103107266473927
sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentine s marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was concluded   201.21969792652428
sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all   157.08465850070235
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening   54.4728065711242
my sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance   76.23083563957485
it is possible said milady   187.7771477217056
we will judge you in spite of your silence   62.848780748608796
see if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the palace   158.7333047905476
de villefort s voice was heard calling from his study what is the matter   103.8584949118583
what do you think should be done asked athos if we have no news of them to night   146.4373920234842
i had no previous knowledge of your visit had i   101.02890588792931
valentine tell him if you love maximilian   185.6089573834999
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century   109.51300983403314
then they began to pass around the dusky piquant arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north   166.10462970381164
they say the dead know everything   102.30211230576938
you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word   96.9297505140433
his lackey who by an unforeseen piece of ill luck had quarreled with the officers disguised as stable lads miserable scoundrel   201.22861317142082
a queen accustomed to be obeyed i am excited at the first opposition   65.01486442799988
but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured   143.88496095494878
bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice   60.734414683682466
take it said she and be accursed   13.454547617278081
cried she sinking upon the shoulders of milady   117.64968129601561
i shall tell him therefore and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me   102.15040987693067
i say you wished to avenge yourself on me and i say that it is horrible   129.0607517889557
the drawing rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from china of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture   36.22122388220714
so much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seven in the morning bernouin came to arouse him his first words were well what s the matter   62.443669508103476
the grating against the library door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insensibility   91.45693652172814
would you rather die then and cause maximilian s death   157.06116888834643
the two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat   92.8819977988585
near the louvre the four friends met with m   189.26524509930385
the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day   30.081957288467308
listen said he to him   112.70659051047909
he became curious to solve the problem   106.3883172902563
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time   102.0493484885323
d artagnan sprang back   96.9137132285164
do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the bed   172.33534502988496
she is there said he   173.09297712070145
because you have not yet invited me   95.54800351878944
replied aramis in a tone of resignation   126.69943466233256
or the holy blood i will spit you all like ortolans   56.153858316753386
sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder   27.563007747617092
cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him   17.204120508389565
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death   93.6169785321089
yes athos i know what you mean we shall do very well at the parpaillot   89.06963267904794
when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order   83.6895198062941
you would have been abducted and conducted back to paris   38.52494399804944
you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take   119.40873669372867
patience said the abbé in a tone which made the dying man shudder   119.68869654140696
i know it monsieur   161.41953009271123
but i will know   107.48941093939757
then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was filled   213.16987004143783
get as near to him as you can and cut off two   97.29568110940278
marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on mericourt   93.14775851114794
the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century   180.95140653089274
i was about to become an abbé and all was arranged   89.14064209692886
i must speak to him about it   30.11346353218491
repeated danglars   117.52376182314623
until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone   52.7748296006672
that is another matter   179.39535077945686
and madame de villefort cried baptistin   75.7712973137998
and d artagnan rushed into athos s chamber   81.16520307553247
the camp had entered saint omer   184.61055236197012
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred   125.46570676205012
confided to me it shall never escape my lips   135.1302310813649
he is worn out said debray   83.75400821839587
danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of safety   53.05585255921738
he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him   121.13891296196378
the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea   173.72394006025286
he has come   99.15732080654517
athos lifted his finger and grimaud was silent   141.00380431451282
i have loved him four years   118.92560332835635
it was la carconte   149.65660772154985
i do not hesitate you know said grimaud   81.70323408791558
the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball   149.96517311369962
i do not know my age for i have not counted the years i have been here   95.51978000945246
yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold   108.04250893396522
you had friends albert   47.972759331010764
and therefore continued athos the cardinal the true cardinal the other one determined one fine morning to arrest poor marie michon and send her to the chateau de loches   141.20681162592757
would you have given up the letter aramis   184.40937834812348
let us try what we can do then said the notary   93.80922738310866
my dear count said albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory   68.70861142607393
no but i have just met with a terrible adventure   58.528179071917364
in the first place you have plenty of money haven t you   139.51367126450737
oh aramis   118.48424706835296
young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command   144.94626542073732
if you are attacked by day or by night fight but retreat without shame   221.47847735171229
now then do you wish for anything else   127.09036204616123
a shudder ran through the young man s frame   114.02224480511822
unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead   177.73835689485887
why i made a vocabulary of the words i knew   133.65442457219007
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds   87.73197076397665
oh i can not behold this frightful spectacle   95.71411677148527
with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man   84.62215530726913
yes his father replied the abbé   111.94877615563209
all night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way   168.14393511623433
at length an honorable peer morcerf s acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived   142.66629326863205
all was quiet but on returning from m   13.196582682437963
i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information   97.21515922972537
then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta   154.7587001233283
while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars i was reading the paper to my grandfather   188.02879146926577
no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live valentine live to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart   170.92321111398613
anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door   109.32111850815512
why do you not realize a six months a year s advance even and retire to brussels   101.78116470180238
exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips   182.37230977632004
there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different key   71.68372729971215
hold your tongue you stupid fellow   60.355468329402946
then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels   77.94955248899745
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money   123.16113883790808
i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa noirtier that the contract is to be signed this evening   106.7107404762574
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly   132.40061811522932
delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport and delivered it to d artagnan   54.838055507566146
parbleau   31.965746053967123
he will not return till after the taking of the city   130.17933014479055
then all the members looked at each other with terror   176.5415502618337
athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied we had a short discussion upon dress   75.34302300591114
muttered gondy taking his hat to go away   174.24988853330012
he bowed with great friendship to the count   106.4421803009847
said my father to his palikares   61.94583747231567
the valet bowed and retired and albert returned to his inventory   122.68495737667722
parliament indeed   164.05336033197275
the two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together   140.8671941062329
but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there insults   85.87456191730384
from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days and the prudent banker had purchased at 206   146.14247340765215
these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome   121.19878895440274
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos   116.85623890833752
continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband   58.62067713977874
asked felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal   75.62849783268393
we take him to the other side of the french frontier and offer him hospitality at bourges   157.33301438925977
all eyes were turned towards this man for to all except athos he was unknown   187.9448128067261
we are judges of wounds we old soldiers athos added smiling   142.26906764373945
in returning with the comte de la fere and monsieur d herblay our crime would be confirmed   90.63926625970235
leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of montlhéry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name   69.89558714003647
he caused me to be instructed gave me masters and when i was thirteen years of age he sold me to the sultan mahmoud   127.98959007578026
said d artagnan i beg you will have a care what you say   55.302429012308174
the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning   123.29231350925664
to tours   106.76680502539287
who wants me   103.36742758153923
not i   117.02085967164902
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity   138.5773753351828
the color mounted to the queen s face   144.42029321283943
said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment   119.03995964124138
morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself   50.18187676646761
monsieur de guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army   157.03300320965653
danglars then opened the window   173.5523117073616
what do you mean by that   115.70247915422054
by the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized planchet   125.92690859151232
tell me at least who you are   147.84418647363844
besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel   150.98854982418288
the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in paris   153.37092901126613
he is then the same englishman whom i met at ah yes indeed   173.07709690261143
contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute   187.4215880448209
the dog turned his back to the cane   113.72205876577769
are we alone   94.25601793435445
wait a moment no threats if you please m   100.17721196290708
monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord   127.35454111201082
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo   135.65385153921872
but the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside   43.71828191808811
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated   194.02180626002468
the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard   194.45163106513223
i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence   183.70978507822227
there is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new boarder   127.77656908936814
infamous task   68.12035593645533
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears   86.20600556199457
there is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it   181.802461439502
cried felton covering that hand with his kisses   107.65270135754398
no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression   119.7997733046262
her hands clutched her armchair   177.33013766794252
d artagnan began to smile   168.8417388483295
at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared   70.66636094003248
have you a heart   126.34552920807346
it is true that my father will be equally angry   98.72336388914214
fear nothing he said   102.11622498184934
as i know that you do not like to ask money of your friends i offer you some of my own accord   108.6240408326314
you ate it   125.77143952798777
cloud and not elsewhere before the d estrées s pavilion and not in another street   110.53560397925642
continued morrel answering his own thoughts   82.61058882666475
what is the matter sir   103.00526969614216
he put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanied by porthos returned to settle with mousqueton who naively and like the worthy steward that he was handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself   13.20616572681216
dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors   107.63975133004571
he is afraid and retreated before the bayonets madmen are not afraid of anything   152.3712876543245

tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one o clock in the morning   64.48877427733142
d artagnan summoned anne of austria s servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queen s presence   150.19629160622634
the stairs did indeed lead to the garden   122.64454723965082

the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes   170.81444768967535
they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation   196.97011473012495
then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell   141.53406948083375
exclaimed porthos   73.45267251940157
tis his custom   146.74351775158175
as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf   99.68142168625363
impossible said d artagnan   9.008116759479975

milady recognized the step of lord de winter   82.03413476826793
come with us to marseilles come along   118.14847774956863
this voice was that of athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser   157.09783540125835
seek them my lord and find them i conjure you   75.62617633236312

and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too well   136.74542827500196

and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man   158.3422251885548
but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied   118.47152233353665
thanks father thanks   103.35752810475987

franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two corsican bandits with them   112.88127284383077
the queen was standing in the room pale with anger   182.17603317754856
my son replied the bishop with firmness you see him not because the passions of the world conceal him   106.17931022099623
i also have a pious visit to pay   157.80991947783093
the fact is one can not remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos   117.3810367531961
and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion st   130.17177019813275
murmured the two young people   82.25695452523459
the party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor   53.180533580219816
they appear to be speaking of me   136.45120372085876
tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place   152.31956347910796
oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless   100.72382749137759
château renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane   71.95384454557626
it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so   118.39666039364381
what do you see   113.874002756771
oh those villeforts are an accursed race   97.7658957596795
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too   175.25658273588738
on the contrary i do not find you the same person at all   88.71419868127991
asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own   82.60992872690059
but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre   116.2248151891343
and he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air imaginable   42.05731238746969
he still lives   165.17746291307395
enough sir enough   219.68007673258404
well let us be sure of that   112.30826887447938
she was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky   31.749666113692797
i think returned anne of austria fixing upon him a glance which in any woman s face would have expressed disdain but in a queen s spread terror to those she looked upon nay i perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign   94.97346663948791
and he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of bank notes   112.08845595679219
there only remained three things to decide what they should write to milady s brother   136.4231845652074
and now he said when he saw that dantès had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for yourself   77.4666605424629
the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and d artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss   86.93778566344417
he thought that voice more feeble than usual   162.2145458029383
but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast   75.23522337730682
they had proposed his going with them to france but he had straightway declined   135.6417849034815
oh monsieur cried dantès you have been rather a friend than a judge   109.33486489464515
inquired the duke what does your majesty mean   76.1150724315644
for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides   97.8446142516257
at eight o clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition   147.08503707521103
alone valentine has no power   156.5752625997164
it seems that he is a spaniard   135.3866948262282
responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth   110.68697738035621
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell   79.66521798049888
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his departure   73.74904169324368
she was overwhelmed   104.41442939307608
villefort quietly opened a window saying it is very warm and the heat affects m   50.00788640390313
oh athos   21.399514904974936
winter approached   159.1596817295965
his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate   85.41844365103087
albert my child said mercédès if i had a stronger heart that is the counsel i would have given you   129.81436274185774
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it   121.12708347480724
she evidently interrogated him by her look   122.00639528588636
as for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when i have completed my affairs in paris i shall go and die in the east   109.61642130148006
he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him   98.64192834242277
oh my god i have suffered enough surely   143.2102328406569
i positively refuse   152.90871251111065
and then james ii   136.12504094186252
and now said the queen addressing d artagnan what is to be done   110.96517895714113
latterly i heard his friend monsieur d artagnan give him that name   96.27038245622191
if the abbé busoni should by any accident return think of me   88.67836637567702
for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive   106.3357898627246
like everything else with money   29.878222341162157
i am entirely at your service m   70.1515191703067
but not knowing you would come to see me i had made an engagement with a friend   106.63516298172134
ah that s it   173.98368144985352
what was the name of your old master   33.35895641990885
aramis stipulated that bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that planchet should furnish the christening sugar plums   132.83153127246027
be satisfied my reverend father i can answer for myself   105.34463514109952
let us see the ground floor said caderousse   105.58185899467932
this war may not only bring great catastrophes upon england and france but misfortune upon you my lord for which i should never console myself   139.30258082899053
but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him   99.39300742757436
only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes   84.87349450272472
what have you got to say   207.8616500747578
he called out in his gascon accent what do you want   125.18473269055414
and you monsieur du vallon is that your advice   65.42026444085727
the boat was built for speed   104.95929113804394
which said the abbé to himself you would have done   37.33732390220635
the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker   35.770426542614416
i don t insist on answering   182.22094369590582
chapter 27   206.90701887102222
said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation   42.82800754469402
he is at bergen in norway   48.52361921007575
dantès observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder   34.76829842257385
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers   157.43321646751377
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess   80.95907837480718
i am a great captain that i am   106.71917561134276
i am not strong enough   111.15702964376372
cried he at length   84.36081721197377
yes if i am killed said albert laughing   124.8391608925237
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter   174.7184109841986
he quietly said what do i care if i am   143.1699611426229
athos and aramis bowed and went out   105.9518474546578
you say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to god s anger well who says your supposition is not reality   144.81695442030892
be more economical   127.51999137179101
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu   130.11183978321017
think only of yourself   149.64199249420716
but this confession concerns me only   78.66188815563908
franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce   123.97199431131178
eleven o clock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st   65.6148799139981
in fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers i have here a whole pile which concerns you   107.2072733155831
a pardon for peppino called rocca priori said the principal friar   179.92572296344318
now one evening when d artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them   198.07014478937668
he came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the details   201.70301655144053
and i overlooked that in italy because in italy those things are thought nothing of   186.52352903355978
if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spada s letter written on the wall in characters of flame if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain   62.39373098027562
i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris   84.72133253286405
that strength was my life   99.82914724418447
he only groaned   105.78437039581972
i have not slept a single instant during all this long night   42.31659980450401
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others   105.05936465957801
at last do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you   139.03918877317506
then he murmured the words of the english poet frailty thy name is woman   66.38143068326885
well then let me have a bottle of the least expensive   90.7277632438099
thus richard iii   139.15807133729166
then he rose and went out   137.36131558140738
and i not at all said the prince laughing   43.21976834064556
there are some situations which men understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain   146.13853792272099
do you wish for a notary   134.04247092133306
if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare   145.67242324299968
so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris   131.7598406648091
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow   65.09961702969167
lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him   143.40492638984705
in my name said mme   166.45789918509846
when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon   82.29095294171691
i am but a minister who wants no servants being myself nothing but a servant of the queen s   94.05910228404038
the councillor placed himself at the window   112.71775652949104
i will await you at the corner of the rue du musée and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me   88.15781037864119
he thanked the governor bowed and departed   122.30562314555681
his two companions were already on horseback   71.64453926965479
pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were overcast by grief   42.793262007124895
be this evening about ten o clock at st   171.96208991000304
monsieur d artagnan is in monsieur dessessart s guards and this gentleman is in the company of monsieur de tréville s musketeers   53.61771884988819
but you only asked 100 000 francs for a fowl   87.97855476619846
he married her   107.78391612215722
confide my shame to you cried milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another confide my shame to you a man and i a woman   228.72868422358226
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal   159.21889764700492
milady held out her hand to him   94.45857568844565
and since you assure me that the cargo is all safe and sound m   128.42537919526615
those who love me follow me   134.22747523849893
because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape   107.8851332799644
i should know what doctrine he leans to and i should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron   159.95711714361195
do you shut it   80.521885647696
asked albert in his turn astonished at this strange theory   160.3349740309605
the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst d artagnan glided behind the curtains   105.56865037187815
it is the best thing to do   158.61407601582522
that s the last folly to be committed said athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy   99.95340375980018
let us go to breakfast   41.75562917394356
the first was a royalist the other suspected of bonapartism   104.20698822343412
madame cried mazarin you have ruined us all the king yourself and me   164.06193301532957
said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason   219.8016025359784
was it not this d artagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmes déchaussés   108.25704562919202
then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal   152.0334822306316
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes   206.9094719407389
aramis smiled as one who hopes   108.10092827250479
i wish to speak to him   151.10997348342437
ah come in come in monsieur d artagnan   136.12062939032057
near paris is it not   116.49626081949822
the steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of bank notes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there   171.18910045137122
you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations   135.35215110729553
zounds my lord i don t know yet   20.98897132815712
countess returned franz totally unheeding her raillery i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite   107.8859747536994
still he ought to have been here said debray   86.45560697539126
at the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs   139.45473149653498
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent   140.6762916395311
50211m madame said the count it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness but i offer you consolation   91.28352503382678
but be laconic i beg   80.2742892626198
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldn t serve mazarin   141.5799674034455
well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count   59.51492809364182
i do not understand italian   47.61303634680543
yes you understand that explains all   123.76636970298159
i have a dreadful headache said albert   206.54499527664711
what else   55.007911028936434
he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont du gard   109.18680298501774
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me   139.0919911791148
he hastened with franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner   156.190688273254
and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop   124.44625242935895
you have had too much already drunkard said danglars   5.120941140172789
fernand s fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune   94.1276465316459
the cardinal i believe would give the world to prevent my success   170.1012212034537
but i will take the left hand it is my custom in such circumstances   125.93747344591463
you like your title do you not   55.319911429016585
did you ever see that man before   125.46930551492878
ah true said aramis   56.868340483964296
and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer   97.61190728790123
people will come to the rescue   146.51034791614597
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him   85.39753927863958
and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven   149.4555712597545
smiling is a thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end inasmuch as re established so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our eyes open at once upon the past the present and the future   129.2323166288984
milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind   97.75229171592228
well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with d artagnan porthos and possibly even raoul   126.50145728330527
her woman s heart was breaking under its load of memories   70.43533873618978
will you come into the garden   151.74909822563922
oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face   113.84485467235302
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall   153.43316067859263
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards   230.02400113669006
giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency   129.11085837802494
neither do i wish to incur guilt   78.7854392932725
after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here   97.44481769042441
and why among us four   125.78352327656982
the inquiry m   122.4875692769417
and how many were there of these linen drapers   144.7514352871798
i have it gentlemen   53.65900140241157
all at once felton stopped   159.0966722752674
why what has happened to you   156.67901459270547
and alone   98.2866044006508
it is already done he said   83.36031305176328
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said   112.2837783794595
and morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase   63.31925297259982
let us speak of nothing till we get home   79.97436470242928
that shall be testified to rest assured   119.49464089471884
meanwhile villefort and d avrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold   183.15329114870613
true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken   154.512251903017
she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife   153.8200970435635
what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end   83.43655360632403
the friend of the cardinal and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner used to be good lord do me the favor to cause me to digest what i have eaten   145.434309311371
d artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without reply   112.29810068679983
and yet he reckoned and with reason on milady   81.27030047827628
be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or one   143.71582997058482
i never once doubted your doing so   97.05293672012597
his companions horror struck could neither move nor cry out   224.11015749511947
monte cristo smiled at her unusual humility and showed her two immense porcelain jars over which wound marine plants of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce   86.56034868846602
come when he will it shall be kept for him   87.57775592660468
these marks are regular   92.00936548639714
it is but fair said porthos and aramis hoping he would choose one of them   169.79536122153846
said albert staring   207.95528025660775
the lackey bowed to the ground and departed   104.6550455635754
let us pursue him and we shall overtake him   28.489969649994762
wait wait   158.55508803583228
for i feel eagle s wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four and twenty hours   78.2755748031418
porthos was seduced by a wine colored doublet and sea green breeches   177.96870207673254
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers   94.61285279067754
then the tunnel will be discovered   165.92549245002215
the next morning danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early   41.510833275370075
d avrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act   126.84246362776292
yes sire interrupted aramis raising his voice bishop juxon the faithful knight of christ obedient to your majesty s wishes   46.19572442256434
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy   171.51647812996882
well monsieur duke said the king have you made your calculations   98.10891534839061
the half pistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket   83.31229310093227
you shall know   135.4701077606082
that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly   66.58490435691388
be said the letter on thursday next at from six to seven o clock in the evening on the road to chaillot and look carefully into the carriages that pass   69.4178823667579
but were you not on horseback   62.04294157724278
do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard her shield the pledge for her dignity for her fortune and her life   121.27999784277998
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that d artagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queen s letter and for which he had repaid m   48.299663236706365
is the officer referred to a relation of yours then   41.96154994555444
the valet went out of the room this time by the centre door but still as silently as before   56.491551837264446
but is the matter certain   24.764468777732844
athos recognized grimaud   136.80467282105008
he addressed about twelve words to him   139.75635409970556
how did the viscount albert fall into luigi s hands   111.71030583089288
you a journalist the husband of renown   101.51757831150876
d artagnan bowed to the duke and was retiring   139.78066879396422
i went of course to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries   95.61669461331087
strange child murmured the baroness   122.0585808816572
what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed   91.78903673168102
that is all i want interrupted dantès   84.07707076515995
but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied d artagnan   70.44764482168611
to prove to noirtier that he was in valentine s confidence and knew all their secrets morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a light   118.73772010230688
d artagnan was on the point of telling athos all   137.65945115521725
and your fee   129.51154663708698
oh fie a quarrel between priests a duel between allies   119.45601554500163
no mother   128.80047317903794
but mark the distinction with which he is treated   170.6557141727064
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken   112.38548536258678
well i should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you   135.91181792286187
c below   70.1257701192803
that is he wounded in the shoulder   145.4587004733055
he knew that i should arrive today at ten o clock   93.84213848081095
we should have heard the blow then   53.293452175397064
and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute   70.02428465157556
monte cristo examined him with the same look that at rome he had bent upon the execution of andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward the abbé busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in 1829 he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities   121.12301985787965
the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds   72.33815395122458
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried   68.60888710694661
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man   127.24735210420477
the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners   62.20641124441783
that s right that s right dantès   101.7327120833928
you do not wish me to marry m   66.0696816806101
i have sir   112.5571947693785
athos by signs desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine   126.65163475066397
they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered nothing   101.34297024161167
but my fears were this time ill founded   128.6026455149618
it is a gift from my beautiful englishwoman or rather frenchwoman for i am convinced she was born in france though i have not questioned her   107.93171786494995
do you see the waistcoat   60.98924431305312
you are not joking are you   191.826414629333
the perspiration stood in large drops on mazarin s brow   117.26155152520528
i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at villefort to be examined by such a man as you   143.35889243797402
he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper   124.71424324363254
and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred   154.7568632432111
then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois tracy besides continued he i have reflected my dear intimate of bois tracy that i am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be   110.37641708971671
buckingham had left england the day before sent as ambassador to spain to demand the hand of the infanta for king charles i   152.22118705196635
ah i understand said beauchamp on our friend albert s account   108.4412196999143
once beyond saint denis we shall have nothing to fear   76.038457341353
but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellais only fired to appease their consciences   88.40024771374071
honoré   39.509627099632795
have you the money he demands   151.6231540348582
but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less expressive   132.95208701855475
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis chapter v   77.53050125956491
and now i wish to see him on an affair of great importance   123.68860985188907
why said danglars in the letter i believe i have it about me here he felt in his breast pocket yes here it is   99.2140932278701
sir replied olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning   150.23814961765115
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the king s attorney   142.02173409751015
murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered   201.03509641006156
we will go together   39.993178982874966
while his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance gate and cast out on the doorsteps m   100.52448510916443
well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions   173.72997046743927
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips   34.95034361406877
i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oil here is my lamp   58.557620302468926
to the beautiful greek   145.92742316777725
having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track   38.6280360115273
as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly   95.55671511832273
to congratulate me what for   63.67634993464435
and who told you about it   102.03621956349363
something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more melancholy   16.648639585332305
don t be uneasy about that   200.90634345405297
he fell into meditation   105.38901943241108
very possibly   141.01101705484825
go then   128.161856647838
lack a day   185.6070421227983
20157m chapter 35   92.53199810702988
said porthos i am sorry for that   116.59524440192111
oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again   85.70504520787757
she will never write like monsieur de voiture   58.82237733542849
a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast   167.636216942947
you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection   144.44189301797795
and i hate her said château renaud   90.80816103907573
i rescued from the hands of mazarin s police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile where he had been for five years   29.87193876650835
and now there is no more to be said   78.48697492316225
are you waiting for him underneath these windows   109.83636961470546
about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner   30.385653714077307
as for that benedetto who so grossly belied his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him   69.48744813946826
and when is he to be married   116.42378083988457
as it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo or the campo vaccino they wrote to signor pastrini the proprietor of the hôtel de londres piazza di spagna to reserve comfortable apartments for them   129.30615202374068
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no remembrance   141.82525148157777
it was the soul of my husband   95.34108944637752
alas returned villefort i must   106.70188362530365
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered port wine   146.83360625654507
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated   92.16237139411487
the horse was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace   26.793994274086614
the man of meung chapter xv   73.28916936495061
he has insulted you and he shall die   123.97353247461858
well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you   219.45095187996048
i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the hôtel and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor   116.14270314796
de tréville the third personage in the kingdom in the paternal estimation   99.04992572854832
this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count   148.42525912518406
follow you   173.0648590099457
most assuredly replied he   108.28356290868285
cried the sergeant   37.1425273703029
lead two sheep to the butcher s two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die   138.5306640556476
what can i do for the son   146.91750378289004
and if the suspicions of your majesty which i still continue to doubt should prove to have any foundation what a terrible disclosure what a fearful scandal   131.04918518019213
we have   58.74206335118845
fore gad these frenchmen have no consideration   39.6486458847893
cried château renaud   104.23813912332861
the matter was arranged as d artagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where parry waited on him harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions   65.84567295439632
madame henrietta is almost no longer queen   169.38813866485475
take every care of him i beg of you   108.08673709978262
certainly all four   141.00493449258727
do you say m   192.76037446789917
vicomte come here said athos   25.56767686865807
already up raoul   159.98071183696274
during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed madame de villefort had gone to visit m   120.31261158207458
are you a man   156.08742848918644
don t make a bad use of it i entreat you   83.16242714926932
you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph   124.5113855528879
in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby   40.08072820313296
a gesture a smile and a word from grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short astounded   136.21147019138726
the celebrated cucumetto pursued in the abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the garigliano like manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno   142.05801949667116
what do you mean by that monsieur   24.780245250882217
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him   159.28086760717122
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in   116.31867134283864
poverty pshaw   65.2154042802712
for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat   84.50982689376752

it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said athos   113.44932068571254
on his side d artagnan became more cautious also   62.6238572747134
this was our resolution   31.432778967398576
come continued d artagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice   118.10965488621056

i really must pray you to excuse me but in truth i was not attending to the conversation   54.630596975738385
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only half aroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake   72.16478680958627

yes monsieur i know only him   106.1242471008691
and even this diamond supposing that d artagnan in his projects of ambition wished to keep it to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queen had not in the meanwhile since he could not part with it more value than the gravel he trod under his feet   149.1622591553067

toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime trees   133.22006059520584
this was before his servant came   86.52068555494577
she turned toward the wall to smile for there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her   68.22798052022162
in a corner was the spanish companion donna estafania who had followed her from madrid   107.24755949873123
three of my best soldiers whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heart three of my best soldiers i say athos porthos and aramis had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning   167.44399263200083
as to that answered mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty i must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the english   98.69766948673099
let it be a million said caderousse   168.08859432539035
do not concern yourself about that   127.88579938477945
the host shook his head   98.76521860939616
i have an old affair to settle with him when i am cured and sound again   48.22083053528665
beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated   137.7644448220346
at ten o clock then if you please   121.23336912359663
count what am i bound to do being in possession of this secret   151.7485576365035
gervais and do not bow too low to this italian   57.440661707213025
you have heard perhaps said the comte de salvieux one of m   129.34974152379795
edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed   94.52530140678792
nonsense let us break open the door and if he is too far gone in his madness well we will kill him   60.485664714875014
a very simple one said valentine   129.739802144791
at the word notary noirtier made a sign to her to stop   62.79794343766514
yesterday i was at the house of a doctor of theology whom i sometimes consult about my studies   102.6755854647254
could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the camp   115.97520328239614
a man between fifty five and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard   66.70440007178124
see my lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself   144.13031754381132
the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army   59.92308519840853
muttered athos   155.17991339697394
he called successively at the abodes of athos porthos and aramis   77.06097283410458
whispered aramis to athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt   108.79520941004719
who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be   141.2606156882639
that is true said porthos echoing d artagnan s sigh   180.17355500440937
there is a certain fatality in it   148.22708064728423
a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror   137.56581349370313
he then laid him down on the floor where d artagnan after giving him just time enough to draw his breath gagged him with his long scarf   112.76754029550979
why i says i still think you ve got too much on   106.33925847453627
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive   160.49881872260198
there is one comfort we are all in cash said d artagnan   87.7313024558615
milady was not mistaken   82.12608293474119
that is a little regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the lord   52.42187971967855
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side   143.79656942841342
thou hast done well   149.2907313405587
come first of all said athos to d artagnan my friend that i may shake hands with you you our rescuer you the true hero of us all   147.71981705627263
porthos drew back a step   49.43809009772724
cried jussac   57.35437278671022
it is not the king   58.24058691344304
you never knew her   103.34132999536844
her crimes i know them not   159.12045895120252
are you sure you are more reasonable   100.05463602065392
impossible for three reasons replied athos   33.4795338700836
he would crush you at a word   159.78897125888187
i was indeed alone no noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night   71.09804824893612
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself   128.25281933536087
believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you   164.26688122132867
i am listening madame with the greatest interest said mazarin   103.68882859102752
if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon   142.26186927560224
and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me   148.57521986812012
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but d artagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis   147.92242443567028
he made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream   34.70659015876363
said mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye   84.07047883556585
she continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once   168.6314490021296
well said valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of it   188.48380167045855
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief   80.65084309658911
you are the pearl of brave bold men   8.247987041699133
i thought that madame was ill and i wished to bring her help responded the maid frightened at the terrible expression which had come over her mistress s face   3.571243333073724
who told you that my dear   22.57759895154001
the guests chapter 40   121.73703962580151
grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened   85.44982596742445
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions   79.30433354231626
as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port   169.42877424213842
the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall   86.6387288711213
as he spoke dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing vessel had been wrecked and started   141.12252351988997
that day the minister s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill humor   1.365899340683157
then i make a sacrifice   122.73730416898438
pray to the almighty to spare his life and i will take upon myself to promote his happiness   122.80023311146545
and who thinks of using him ill   119.28518529110477
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you   125.06513224800665
so far well said athos i perceive you know me   127.07625119231284
because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that m   118.173305187896
and this is all   75.3753042210096
yes sir replied julie with hesitation   65.0274920374956
these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness   93.6827898926795
no bring me all four together   131.04588951545668
i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me   5.111069106988211
let him come   127.14737454269174
the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimed if you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence   134.22013993510058
but peppino did not even belong to my band   69.81678512325499
and said cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size   133.74900317325066
i will now go up into my apartment   33.742332002376116
have you anything particular against him   104.15207049421934
i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity   235.28585426871456
it was the island of monte cristo   85.3820805353828
he must be mad said the inspector   3.2158638401556345
but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror   104.7335659175263
did you come from boulogne   20.202931013938382
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear   143.71775504077146
but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself   171.6579117309238
and blood too   205.010013627625
felton darted into the palace   69.52436102958693
mousqueton trembled in all his members   149.2237399577543
the less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man   119.19178276883505
not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again   99.21635228212021
the little old man remained at the coach door   147.99743898138536
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see   121.11916881157063
it seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened   57.31846459358082
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la fere i can see nothing remarkable about it   124.17897311162879
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness   90.66943779250926
the result was that the two men communicated with one another   95.03875735991804
during this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease   103.6703125162251
yesterday morning madame   113.2940751348906
just think   162.0377798125772
come come continued the count complaints are unavailing be a man be strong be full of hope for i am here and will watch over you   115.05868639417132
but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences   191.0030339566809
thirty five minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you   144.3302351446494
gimblou another bottle   84.2101447577765
besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of m   112.25890812571767
when crime has been committed and god doubtless in anger turns away his face it is for the physician to bring the culprit to justice   19.76100306422549
look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke   63.88064686775007
monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion   144.08779266215294
you talk like a noodle my friend said caderousse   139.26639697754007
i think nothing   155.99896779268636
that is like a good master   131.6045565043334
i have not so much as you have since i do not fly as you do   187.46918254012468
held a gourd full of rum to his mouth   105.72557566470104
he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle   169.04182640445725
said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me d artagnan   201.58942674329793
la mazzolata chapter 36   37.57536939401135
i will deny it   154.59381082484654
three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not heartfelt   118.44332130990607
that too is impossible   28.42794302809712
i have that honor your excellency   41.69631783169628
it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests   151.23695714748584
they were placed in a wagon built on purpose and thus the sterlet lived twelve days the lamprey eight and both were alive when my cook seized them killing one with milk and the other with wine   201.82935423809943
and you have seen this cavern morcerf   99.71067511825176
around us were all my mother s servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction   125.3565529175793
but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp   70.7998433903276
9 when they tell me such things i only shrug my shoulders and say nothing   166.52606524807112
did you come to noisy to defend him   20.391317355001632
until saturday when i may expect you may i not   152.66094429953034
albert i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea   67.82119868931525
and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically   172.7475340221302
she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity   180.720136076727
mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered my lord the queen henrietta maria accompanied by an english noble is entering the palais royal at this moment   119.14064015159978
everything is paid replied the host and liberally   88.82328599663794
thus bassompierre who was at once protestant and catholic protestant by conviction and catholic as commander of the order of the holy ghost   63.2515415807126
he has slept a long time on a hard bed so he won t object to a soft one   132.33757591483555
i have proof of it   54.140424521384176
but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly   123.81787358298025
the duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read my dear duke you may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note   50.420239842372524
de villefort cried the president do you yield to an hallucination   30.57901893931752
but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies   197.8621510234906
happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own   86.76511626339739
he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within   70.41864769543866
a man of about forty five or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern   128.10094930431035
i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy   134.18671847626922
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer   129.36271790261725
and monsieur de nogaret de la valette what do you say of him   76.77880605649648
go on m   143.6774841938622
that i am exceedingly disquieted sire   137.57832851744908
d artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat   165.03167819108074
do you wish me to do so   91.38940152680235
and the abbé s plan has not even the merit of originality   120.31174075992428
do not these circumstances appeal to your memory   6.055596173181598
and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw   168.06343939309733
yet i expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment   144.3383734382767
it was only inhabited by a guard kept there for the prevention of smuggling   106.60494215097283
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role   68.27959369844157
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties   77.30834297003933
i cut it in his copse and i am taking it to the chateau   58.96406731622628
said morrel sorrowfully   18.259602169784188
antoine mounted two horses properly equipped which a servant without livery had waiting for them   37.87872289518221
he had always something or other to do   157.9707299309999
the queen stopped him   25.208427981694896
you must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it   88.37308173923114
d artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger   80.26168285996488
something you have worn and that i may wear in my turn a ring a necklace a chain   189.1799808434539
well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject   66.71052887959868
valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak   147.64608803228484
not so   75.36418469187913
then i drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain and drank it   146.48802183654644
beware   97.1029769170045
yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not   104.13475363513119
i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you   46.532488945119866
has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes   100.15331981533382
morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said oh yes yes i bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me the edifice which misfortune has destroyed providence may build up again   88.95649832273901
the most satisfactory part of the matter said d artagnan is that there remains no trace of it   114.75778086640244
but you are not always travelling   76.11761441840906
the count then is in the chateau   82.10269005625895
no one has seen him   140.5850057677617
could you let me hire a horse of you   123.22590948777349
and if i have come my dear father said gérard drawing closer to m   208.73009165764796
yes sire said a voice which athos recognized as that of aramis   123.11576154905015
20333m certainly your excellency   112.90823989618742
we thought it dead he repeated   208.41279821046822
no madame contrary to most history it is true   130.5307133486769
the authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities   61.93060013985483
morrel i believe   97.38347403791616
will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made   161.23178668791132
at another time added he i should have said give them besides two hundred francs over as a present   158.65202692577066
do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost   120.3082014167054
and porthos and aramis   76.29983007221846
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal s motive   119.47883611117638
it is for a consultation which will last three hours at least   158.125804310686
on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay   179.02382547038695
de villefort left the room and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother   8.333909750300293
well bazin said d artagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more   119.6770637792071
that is just the case precisely so   81.86038012199205
i am perfectly aware of that fact answered monte cristo calmly   171.29052164448623
and where is he going   42.72871826250973
but d artagnan took no heed of it   110.93001114337696
all very fine my lord but at the very first hint you give of such a thing i will strangle you and become frondist   138.35321417714846
and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another   87.57407578678112
the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since i saw you madame bonacieux and i should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks   53.2505699491978
the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph   89.6671972761983
oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear   81.9095737181814
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one   51.67781754446528
then i would kill him rather than let him go   69.07134378723973
well then let us say no more about it said d artagnan   66.64874450060671
come tell me what is the joke   169.3208845496031
it is this sir said the king angrily that general cromwell has reached newcastle   92.59885859024573
at that moment patrick entered the room crying a letter from france my lord   76.54405383733194
and yet that woman deserved her fate   128.22203724072813
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing   152.43575415892707
the horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the wall   101.02776471647067
but if you don t know this woman how do you know her name   63.07197630461954
and he is in paris   101.8144516055673
she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed union   102.78501568672603
it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on médéah   33.22885958387377
of course you sent for a doctor   145.87142940329778
did you see the president at the minister s last night   96.19486476695785
one was compelled to say i am the angel of the lord   126.38414667632583
noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle   142.39615305806242
ali made a sign in the affirmative   169.06093044569099
morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance and pointed him out to valentine   70.0284316747491
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him   91.35316497292082
sire replied the courtier laughing in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of france but i fear i am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt   169.83040344621293
but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was perfect   155.79506629005618
anne of austria re entered her apartment and came out again almost immediately holding a rosewood casket in her hand with her cipher encrusted with gold   34.27567605403165
coquenard in that tone which says take my advice don t touch them   128.29021506530532
the name of the owner of the winning horse   115.51319168252347
monsieur d artagnan promised me his assistance   156.6542585800634
and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to him   32.06237554020211
oh heaven exclaimed julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then   112.95570283942581
as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about   46.90189693358231
oh mother   133.2486700996464
the thin spare man   182.8921415003189
when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place   92.45043328702783
twas too brief an enjoyment and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life   147.34754653203203
well answered   98.14649890551462
that first sight of the château d if which told him whither they were leading him   153.67655745266995
this seemed a good augury   193.2710745077507
all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity   81.70983141128198
edmond if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead   138.72418738594658
od s bodikins said groslow as the four friends entered i had almost given you up   171.67186852980026
there were the large dark melting eyes the finely formed nose the coral lips and pearly teeth that belonged to her race and country   153.41762278404389
at the end of the dinner he entered in person   109.90672694117829
there is yours my dear friend replied d artagnan   122.9294412796222
he had the resolution to stop with this   108.5697603260135
i will let you know a week beforehand   136.97789780090395
let the past be forever forgotten   79.60161986871671
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money   87.57139807886249
you know him by what title   114.69635870195454
when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair   100.74383799292949
well bring it said athos   42.83228082380212
i hope i am not the cause   160.1835280664823
said franz then you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano   131.2500193732015
i have only kept this secret so long from you continued faria that i might test your character and then surprise you   224.28050903489367
your captivity shall be mild be assured   164.1694220599254
go to bed planchet and sleep soundly   179.13944720211478
it was in fact a small craft from dunkirk bound for boulogne   116.10369087777467
he will gain himself a reputation   93.20771373490822
seventy six years   91.46836394077567
while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars   73.07287989533083
after this satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at meung without remorse for the past confident in the present and full of hope for the future he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave   72.6534029750467
replied danglars pleased to find the other so tractable   176.9782863958759
danglars speeches said debray   91.61767080972044
he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne   207.1852393588655
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time   77.07764533621155
you are wrong replied villefort significantly   128.61375240434356
you will ruin us all   121.54901225275515
they came nobody knew whence   113.39770192619241
that is it replied the cardinal dryly   64.18865794523256
that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery   114.44601598441055
a lion even   178.4631872650965
still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you i am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance   117.16593732768246
the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court both in the name of morality and for the respect due to humanity   201.84256953854157
bertuccio said the count severely   135.2320505383661
look look doctor said villefort he is quite coming round again   139.761940306168
mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of jean goujon like a bas relievo representing an equestrian statue   86.7482489946419
faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task   56.92841861314766
yes the servant has given his description   115.51013893605455
he was born at pampinara and entered the count s service when he was five years old   139.12607565497433
your pardon   35.13768076626221
i will do as children do for fear of losing the paper repeat the name along the route   34.386702464836546
madame de motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her   136.18300045318446
villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three ill looking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frock coat and hat with broad brim   91.21901635583669
planchet recognized him first   122.30759432953994
d avrigny m   105.54858978600814
he had only been back an hour or two   97.10106490367521
what were you saying to this youngster   176.59784967685152
if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us   63.85846649831818
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal   162.21081037640084
i do not understand my lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out   66.72096471429904
he brought him also the amount of his wages which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for   176.34358175333054
de tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that louis xiii   59.56681220212857
the chancellor advanced therefore toward anne of austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air and now it remains for me to make the principal examination   65.58590724871065
they proceeded thus to peronne   189.90557937080163
said caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it   80.02247175009761
asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him   177.72629724342522
well madame i perceive i must do as you wish   78.52478642871608
as usual valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them   127.24742800453048
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound silence   42.36190067065719
moreover you are our prisoners   137.34042471306643
there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration   114.86355618159949
a vagabond a corsican   60.496664945551494
replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn   144.82479683658164
in that case i assure you there would very soon be a countess and viscountess of morcerf   132.6256935647173
the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time   160.6325148111263
you pretend not to know because government was not rich enough   35.22866052756915
it will be useless for him to find you here   180.2051938701755
are you french sir   130.6435183225383
thomson french were your bankers   172.14613748365753
albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted her   140.77876064597393
it was mousqueton who was obeying his master s command   50.40924820529857
i informed my superiors that i did not feel myself sufficiently prepared for ordination and at my request the ceremony was postponed for a year   86.39048077454083
well i will have franz and château renaud   64.88216464859931
only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole   156.14243142530802
at least we shall see each other again m   68.23301453537911
he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience monte cristo   73.61970331987405
when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you   143.32150320329424
and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining   200.35389413564542
suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man   132.58501688239224
on what plea   142.06177201994123
trial chapter lxvi   96.91867464437614
i am entirely at your service except only for my orders   47.08169230124216
i will go to the second after attending the first said d artagnan   151.22523361914114
for you told me your father desired the marriage   116.1103162551259
will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have   94.49655475323237
but the diamond i gave you yesterday   105.98632792807406
your liberty was my ransom   1.521223067041177
and at the same time he sprang toward his sword   90.60085130610292
my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence   118.55822205023492
d avrigny cried villefort i can not tell you all i feel at this moment terror grief madness   167.27429757038686
on saturday   162.95162562236976
the queen breathed more freely   185.95463618131112
at any rate it is a french word   85.95871525834431
the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep   64.61187879864056
mordaunt did not reply   114.29431299236224
villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him   63.7592937074449
dantès sighed   194.77216464926505
i fear an attack myself after all these disasters   137.45416901281885
however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachman rue de la fontaine no   223.45523132790055
oh no not at all   64.31523661114464
the two travelers consulted for a moment   159.04848242333742
the cardinal s quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of la pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment   56.52053402853606
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister instead of aiding to crush him   120.18679459626185
indeed sir i recognize you   120.61601908212549
i wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather since he holds the money chest   169.04168411728313
ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake   72.26927875468249
but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard   129.9459287793206
but send me word should you be arrested for then i will return directly   129.90114021205207
said athos laughing   79.20667925603753
well let me see what can you want that begins with n   52.13404259562872
de tréville s spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them   67.77659380338784
alas murmured edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse   118.32877101403872
but let your vengeance fall on the culprits on him on me but not on my son   118.04520295068725
well i tell you i will not drag my daughter before a tribunal and give her up to the executioner   111.47531942500338
the door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into obscurity   90.62261121954302
never to anyone   174.22766525104987
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantès   126.9043162473443
there he saw the grand marshal who charged him with an oral message to a bonapartist in paris whose name i could not extract from him   103.99982402114537
grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands   101.17329762761685
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of d artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost   114.45229675557113
cried he seizing my arm and wresting from me the weapon that had so badly served me you want to take my life do you my pretty puritan   189.5242369134715
have i discovered the truth   62.842248686691676
god has made them senseless said felton   118.20827205314119
the soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat   135.21067308781898
i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered   141.92065342994363
the fact is maximilian that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison   53.856502897877874
their spirits live in me   121.2495584480558
having then a keeper like la ramee i should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my flight   123.9392015490147
château renaud bowed to the countess   82.43457444913034
withdraw then or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london   25.18300026536801
you is it   114.56489616600317
valentine promised all that morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz   136.23824580146436
the three young people separated that is to say morrel went to the boulevards château renaud to the pont de la révolution and debray to the quai   11.665338729504697
since the first attack i experienced of this malady i have continually reflected on it   78.72336044827946
her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by well arched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno   93.41272787100371
her skin was admired for its velvety softness   149.30242731232167
then perhaps it is to your son m   98.83681931920971
en route gentlemen   12.99432365417654
said athos you require too much d artagnan   122.55989014407902
the old man assented   81.97295837636062
to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which i should arrive   99.07004656888378
then you are called monsieur grimaud   100.55687462624586
will you kitty   134.22612704764248
nothing madame   122.99290940654382
and yet i should have preferred you will have the pleasure of the surprise   166.79012286894016
what more is to be done   82.25728918583025
that is agreed upon   189.41184060549216
good caderousse   161.31405165526445
robert le diable chapter 54   79.63054417166539
she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder   36.112485783293764
yes there is something in what you say   89.57500472951645
but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water   80.89179895623147
my name is lady clarik and this measure this measure is general madame   52.3404035755898
i was about to offer myself sir said the priest   147.242263742332
it was not your opinion that i asked said the queen sharply without even turning around   119.28834048701506
a great man in every country m   117.99088186829204
the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger s name was lucien   53.59365281092149
he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches   116.01105689587854
one thing alone struck me of all the exquisite things he placed before us he touched nothing   147.48296834310707
now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel   127.76806039289833
well what is this island   31.31421160727072
is it to make me a captain   127.19123711933183
called a joyous voice from without mercédès   65.19522712472059
either to seek the duc de beaufort or the duc de bouillon and to tell them about this   214.16414870102267
your pardon m   134.2559378951278
i shall borrow from the queen   80.79703747968428
aramis rushed after the fugitive hat   200.10659880516818
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there   97.48108139598065
and this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young d artagnan for so was the don quixote of this second rosinante named from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous appearance that such a steed gave him good horseman as he was   190.24649750186518
in that case i will forgive him   180.8035853566717
a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin   123.95098395957442
25th april 1498   156.85638062318083
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it   143.95376753490135
it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis   85.9735548664602
madame said raoul the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached   133.4238154553383
only as our gascon was not easily intimidated or rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty   130.03045094072166
some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging   204.93886564184993
but tell me dantès if you had command of the pharaon should you be glad to see danglars remain   55.449579441697345
monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba   125.33542412218661
and athos   136.38877904378862
a flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of milady   83.9483269722696
well well said monte cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things m   148.55419181421587
why should i do that   46.36467480336532
her soul lives in the body of this demon   167.67623871778116
that is to say you are invited m   142.80065760706907
the lock turned and the door slowly opened   77.49290076213242
i see it   132.25298589224914
i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man   166.06563926626245
no not even to my betrothed   130.4945512633842
do not think so bertuccio replied the count   73.0451372187162
said d artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy   153.16017526854512
now an englishman is an enemy   86.35419659120487
then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand   86.12029692564757
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered   140.35693768453797
then he added aloud but you have relations left you   169.31490772687778
oh i don t doubt that replied d artagnan   80.71090870174852
said porthos his eyes glistening at the news   78.57471806380948
that it seems is where he meditates on state affairs   78.07113805817437
but that is not all madame   165.55964513188542
if you are take care for i shall never forgive you   116.76725037214477
the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his eminence   145.9869243563823
as he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said in a voice perfectly composed to the palais royal at full trot   156.16626343938447
besides the tattoo has been sounded and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the others   132.5944566621332
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight   122.95540426550238
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds   57.31476326073959
your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied d artagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm   84.10130084895061
that is very easily done   51.5429651315789
it communicates with my mistress s by that door   70.88545289350614
the office of the king s attorney chapter 68   75.90562257726899
one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita   121.69642877530659
at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer   92.19985865002748
and as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house   148.5914543641091
i would rather find it triply bolted   155.4107397575758
the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied you are a native of marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going   74.93087359792753
about eleven o clock in the morning they perceived amiens and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn   89.54261565694479
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d artagnan and porthos   135.96358694451675
responded dantès almost terrified   86.77954271277193
thus dantès who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth   24.5022062839068
then replied m   181.38131074443066
here is m   77.69284412392125
meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols   127.77806060027945
nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear   135.35889331086437
and you aramis   152.48381319764042
in short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops   137.7061735594373
the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited   113.29470662630331
all this is very sad which you tell me   81.31080628573858
and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice   135.26167939590678
what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace   33.774506252498156
the weakness of a murderer   150.32979292433154
ah i remember athos is at monsieur de tréville s   170.88697512772677
an apoplectic stroke   109.74154628916872
then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret   81.38945830432351
we will not constrain you to help us   53.29880230680208
a slave does not dictate to a master   123.28839505713569
because she was afraid of compromising you   100.49519846741671
about what time   129.50244573126946
very well at one o clock then replied d artagnan turning the angle of the street   79.55671265747517
d artagnan nearly jumped for joy   161.13533415769137
this one is i think a sterlet said château renaud   100.5612036485281
no no albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orange flowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes   56.51409190522873
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders   125.99044798539386
yes betrayed by the scotch amongst whom i was born whom i have always loved better than the english   128.42060481573142
then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face   115.2575232476368
she is perhaps a prisoner   125.57312274601048
four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit   107.62905930970273
but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel   92.2639304648883
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open   132.2568434303229
in business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents   104.98777321286451
it is only to poets that such things happen said athos gravely   95.03474221303283
friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the quai a la rue dauphine and disappeared   101.37569236517294
and that one if i mistake not a lamprey   101.36028551668404
cried lord winter   106.15716523164626
inquired mazarin   113.97255629179821
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos   211.88849609180306
tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold colored silk embroidered with pearls   130.34819805925494
d épinay for he came this morning to paris   110.06940834799153
he has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always kept   204.7743530846742
finally said felton finally what did they do   40.561756306639325
meanwhile albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying florentin is your horse fit to return immediately   131.6894061361319
in the meantime said athos i renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go i will go with you   77.59647278182013
bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen were only two against four they began to cry to the rescue   121.62423730519367
he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martin s babylonian pictures   121.2188601302254
bonacieux hesitated to continue   25.419192397034053
in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value   82.94480274986176
there were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds   79.75049132789809
to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25 000 francs   114.49384181606825
here s half a pistole   139.67874761304645
what do you tell me   87.88495338625
his life madame belongs not to him   185.08585388261804
the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him   143.75183200280725
on these days he spoke a little   114.64581003723457
perfectly safe and sound   108.96151682750114
take care my young friend   141.50038437355846
my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which i could not rouse myself   127.9552012805532
that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan   208.68412467531718
yes but before we can kill him and he will be hard to kill that swiss he will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun   51.19596395396019
well said villefort what is it   222.948274899447
here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please   164.3630818445319
but the two months expire next week   140.69736701205156
i can not calmly say with you providence has struck the blow   117.59314077871173
we shall return to them unless mazarin razes them to the ground   153.27915537322377
what ails you my dearest father   162.05223478030607
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading haydée aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing room   74.63077256966363
once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the queen s   128.51723180681284
the count s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl s mind   166.64798591376035
with anne of austria for that affair was over but he had to adjust matters for m   169.9888709592758
what is to be done   160.24058873736647
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies   82.28220587842293
monsieur d artagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns   135.1547045760647
inspector continued the governor i can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years   113.96062521565499
the three friends remained mute for although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances   104.1331536630272
the project gutenberg ebook of the count of monte cristo illustrated this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the united states and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever   127.18047823363997
you see you were deceived murmured the magistrate   13.48242339871149
i shall soon return said the banker to monte cristo   117.31183008555004
on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires   37.943479386659476
but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances   201.2471045609002
i know it because yesterday monsieur de wardes in a saloon where i was showed a ring which he said he had received from you   123.04843636133484
it is he who in an encounter with your eminence s guards decided the victory in favor of the king s musketeers   104.62698318627315
but in order to avenge herself she must be free   197.50143284371043
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with   52.31325964127401
he did not know said the abbé   115.60134310378375
but you will be left alone   203.0234981365677
whom does your highness wish me to send to you   78.36011465635369
spy cried the duke more and more enraged i will strangle you with my own hands   139.00615296542986
really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant   99.51271800629632
nevertheless raoul you must go to blois and you must make your excuses and mine to madame de saint remy   62.78470188382074
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind   131.65201816012234
another of the number continued the abbé without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse is called danglars   159.07202081892547
the breakfast room was finished in oak   91.68603742631782
has your husband any spanish bonds   107.59039928004105
beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression   145.48459445542565
said the marquise   94.12664825288745
but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred law to intermarry   164.13939576061648
antoine had been his jailer   88.54951578832305
what may that be   120.95683608338385
sometimes when monsieur de chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of parisians all fully armed appear at vincennes to deliver him from prison   109.68015093743347
the carriage drove on   120.7094697292425
when i said rich replied the procurator s wife who saw that she had gone too far you must not take the word literally   111.10298605487425
i love that humiliation i who am master of the universe as was augustus   76.32755502618937
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé dantès spoke no more of escape   80.29695834937738
these undertakings do not suit me as you know aramis   137.87327932011388
well said he to the young girl are you willing my dear kitty that i should give you a proof of that love which you doubt   87.56593583563523
cried porthos who was breathing like a blacksmith s bellows   61.79650736615776
with my usual fatuity i doubted it   71.38208722140973
paris   137.0570245824582
i saw him strolling about here this morning   62.614359942787914
i shall fight heart and soul for mazarin   124.18201404554432
the major drew from his pocket a handful of gold   107.28659084512314
what i can not tell something wonderful an absurdity a miracle of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope   143.18228856873455
for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her character perfecting a beautiful vengeance   119.76612650474158
we do   73.30886195535672
be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing   178.66706595857164
athos was happy happy as he had never been before   89.25435543208087
for very important notes for which closer attention is required i pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own blood   168.09736132403012
i have an order for each of you also   151.47136727591396
dinner was waiting but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon franz sat down without him   192.49792787432844
your holiness   122.5354873893417
said albert with increased though stifled anger   125.75307680637216
this confession said she growing paler what is this confession   138.88190499023278
but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château reached a sort of retired lane and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named   135.78495897499232
wait   196.78694095409986
as he passed by m   71.87029324394476
but la ramee who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art passed his knife which had an iron blade to the duke   120.97010425208254
said d artagnan looking at porthos   213.51347777208633
spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste   115.12649718070845
midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose   186.17062350470272
de monte cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which i have never forgotten   152.7012439879295
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed unless   154.18163472084746
said d artagnan but i i confess i have a contrary conviction   120.02638351966839
it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing you   106.00782973820465
cried d artagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse   163.25291647090683
this letter   91.37807282155896
this is what was done   94.2405926231974
have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire   72.48895873818344
she seemed did she   79.09994962694776
i have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds   71.63656723822326
it is so good that i have distanced m   121.51071123942455
he called her milady   117.70559838557473
do you know her   180.7089635740483
are we quite alone my friend   132.71081324848768
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion   78.12237193928105
that is true said porthos   90.72097839505318
that is to say at the other end of france   92.02313787885173
it was from mme   139.8788177678131
then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel   60.17741851323824
alas yes said porthos it is so   49.83362778189294
notary   86.43706440425078
ah madame cried debray what is the matter with you   77.33572741030346

i made my report to the authorities at paris and a week after he was carried off   43.159159471309735
its agent who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of 287 500 francs i will not say granted but offered me three months   109.86383894781999
i can not say monsieur answered i   94.57077508236132
then he pointed to the door   67.25006396450573
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon   146.0142494999674
i shall have courage   152.48423630716587
no valentine i assure you such is not the case   61.327677545974254
ah you shall see   58.4530616501629
i shall pass all my life thought d artagnan in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot   94.15162254001936
personally i am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon my mother in law and madame de longueville   191.69378149269062
i call those second rate fortunes that are gained by manufacturing enterprises joint stock companies viceroyalties and principalities not drawing more than 1 500 000 francs the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions   24.60703422104028
do not fear that you put me to inconvenience   101.8505389770049
ah my dear fellow said he to franz   74.17289928106038

do not boast of what you have come to paris to do or have done   145.8841416961036
how is it all the better   106.13046586357444
at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late   151.33216101991744
but he paid your ransom   141.86517662654813
he is impatient   172.11398577755293

the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of monte cristo   84.92218482770939

but the mind always remembers   149.9166341162326
athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends poor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind   148.3965240428188
here sire   129.80392129969945

although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends   174.05747170650855
and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by selim   138.31985397308696
i have already often told you of this   147.16721004510364
the young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the boat   51.68332736600824
not that i can accept it but a league off it savors of the gentleman   103.72097237260435
but do you happen to belong to him   141.77134267566788

the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man   137.4284814725397
d artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m   96.48297742556541
the king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day   163.10545729782365
surely valentine you are mistaken   161.15714982278297
in a few minutes porthos had rejoined his companions who were already in the boat   134.2735748672354
and fernand   92.12058221290314
the nubian smiled assentingly to his master s words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count   139.20272106529765
said danglars enraged   105.24262172948269
which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets   135.76195791566064
well said cried aramis   123.56082697392554
i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m   99.66974633371794
murmured mme   76.72522286231762
ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may   12.236111958896501
at length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be executed   23.839400213222987
porthos and aramis arose   108.37031082757322
they went into the chateau   57.78480062581926

his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht   127.73145620860194
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer   201.67945369417666
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services   56.03276616370669
the accused replied that his name was jacques michel bonacieux that he was fifty one years old a retired mercer and lived rue des fossoyeurs no   129.95172483491245
if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said d artagnan i shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavy for with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like   103.86462745870499
the man said in a low voice i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris   186.6524756749272
i promise you it shall be done answered de comminges   151.31372258851485
ah said villefort this seems to me the truth   144.78984768800635
maillard   19.07676780439627
what i know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the catacombs of st   111.48307106284615
you have a broker have you not   180.03608568926313
i have one remaining   85.66756126513522
the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies   135.50298362030648
but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks   81.13644488201356

i might have suspected he was poisoning us   116.44115238028597

there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women   106.03107760904535
we must let monsieur de beaufort come   187.52556031235548

raoul had only been at m   157.653704709646
only you must please to remember that this is friday   198.71892857983107
the sentinel wanted to repulse him   100.43391355189566
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant you who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris   62.81610908806764
and just below this lamp there was laid wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet worked with fleurs de lis of gold a catafalque resting on trestles of oak   39.04319448873662
there was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was old fashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated   144.43203696914853
it is to him that the queen has been writing all the day   84.65330528744032
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter   133.53901282332276
and old age   127.85863209083251

he turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming raoul   22.05152826413797
not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass   107.373055672585
he had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large cloak   101.20384587367357
d artagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for   128.47074073328815
are we not their majesties servants   174.7174658515512
milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face framed with black hair and whiskers the only expression of which was icy impassibility   57.365131596295065
i would be alone   138.56996584972865
the old man winked his eyes expressively which we may remember was his only way of expressing his approval   52.00395800827025

i said nothing   147.53432595379252
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess s box   111.457921028529
nevertheless had caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of bellegarde   93.94966171728572
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantès carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune   147.49282775590325
the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him   134.8244900162095
it may have arrived since i left my office   21.262198971132392
it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending   42.679984335327276
cried athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder   60.91611767563694
i am to be a soldier then   156.04891105368623
no said the count i was making a suit   87.71925434840674
they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine   112.02100749331701
in fact the blow was direct and severe   126.42086919888297
on her side mme   117.30142816134978
to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the valet   5.298065858736138
you are thoughtful said mazarin uneasily   75.09292510709349
i think he has only been introduced to madame de villefort   87.13271651258607
the count received him with his habitual smile   59.12973140424971
falconers are declining   111.94429455991079
well one can never say what may happen   147.2044997578374
i know that porthos was in a fair way replied d artagnan   128.74665563372977
well then said athos it is agreed   203.44512775932935
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta   139.06599204129452
and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious   124.18838165589366
adieu countess   142.763888513801
and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method   75.49326130966617
these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman   53.76269720423975
she is ill   97.28551189810537
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily   114.47723775267389
dantès saw that he must attack the wedge   42.34271437785107
touching sympathy   119.10075331670485
d artagnan returned to help porthos if porthos needed help   130.94057523113926
so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent   75.42801977910369
it was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying thieves   95.68164772891411
noble and unhappy king   108.96199020694478
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces   46.3695050520907
then according to foreign custom the presentations took place   105.55920711923207
that would be much more difficult   39.76592853395226
vampa measured the distance   25.620709187565126
send your saddle then to the hôtel of the musketeers and your horse can be brought back with ours   159.9295450108485
debray who was present at the explanation   142.8679087602589
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream   122.94680845547408
cried the cardinal with violence   112.758304603371
at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us   2.405124447056494
on landing the count turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding morrel   89.53667613254812
in short continued the cardinal as i have heard nothing of you for some time past i wished to know what you were doing   56.3455777516267
than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion   150.34373721576557
credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had   93.30884116896769
d artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive   204.66209615698986
someone was heard in the corridor   114.65413612076318
at the hour agreed upon groslow came   159.1039153635774
said felton with increasing exultation   155.27300956943435
the patron of la jeune amélie proposed as a place of landing the island of monte cristo which being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen olympus by mercury the god of merchants and robbers classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category   100.82285973800951
julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose   207.6611837925013
ah you scoundrel   92.95649481100415
therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection   122.05505226819865
however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master   134.8708440702765
at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale   129.52548110412343
and i will guard it so carefully that i will be sworn it shall arrive at its address and woe be to him who shall attempt to take it from me   115.27719581456344
this unexpected circumstance brought back richelieu s former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the sea   90.70563081451938
groaned forth villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man   118.39663931561509
and yet it will not be the less said we were four men   11.342026820088819
up   97.24082067623397
i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends   58.92682277959714
but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne   128.96250456417926
free to do what   188.6841482556664
you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you   69.31082168441571
it matters not   77.25092348786836
yes and mercédès   83.69162719641135
ah what a dreadful thing said the young musician   37.14901733081115
it is to throw ourselves into the wolf s jaws said aramis   116.59171412194164
replied raoul   109.89778378649352
but i have often resolved to visit them   111.77522919158791
shouted the three musketeers in chorus   104.44475890101864
and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne dust of the earth   113.55190886671386
i love you   155.8103730187771
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret   78.03046252416348
you seem secretly elated   127.05618907566277
as you please madame bonacieux said the ex mercer   151.54837103402537
and you would have done the same aramis   128.5022434746465
a tuscan count   139.05736407422674
yes said the duke but take care my dear la ramee for i propose to beat you badly   142.58164902447805
i can do it said porthos   148.33160880712785
undeceive yourself again   95.92264899773136
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my death   107.2952112696551
dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance he is about to become a captain   78.38792566537305
the bastion st   48.03584303073505
as for me so nervous and so subject to fainting fits i should require a doctor adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind in the fear i have of dying some fine day of suffocation   85.2818029504561
madame de villefort is ill   80.7814742274885
mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villefort s said he   149.06080496986107
he wished to see everything   117.11229841021694
said kitty timidly   66.46020491233482
said raoul   61.90543579003339
your majesty answered mazarin desires me to do only what i was going to ask you to let me do   86.64054975928462
he had foreseen all   104.696436783602
asked richelieu   88.04540179657023
oh yes said the count you are looking for the sailors   81.90865865991927
i am sure he will look like the great mogul   98.02830323706073
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to himself   173.35006688600907
madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunes it is a punishment   15.033004708517936
this time there could be no doubt   100.48376483254651
and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal   168.48773126573957
milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges   157.60430008045924
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy   42.73882289460602
then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio   74.68129790885764
sleep well your last night as citizen   132.19228902142393
thank you monsieur you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever replied mme   76.77260481321042
we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them   71.4465141916794
ah said he they have sent some fencing master to fight with me   136.37953314602035
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are   183.21579141815465
out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained   251.56582485354417
and of what religion are you then madame   84.2466514651423
then it is understood said d artagnan   121.63489547969276
said aramis to athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante chamber   149.32731694309277
and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of m   81.13370713032094
oh i dare not she forbade my sending for you   121.63374925636597
you seem a worthy young man   165.44297541004096
oh he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect   157.1132515572509
but my lord if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall i reply   1.3266148663511217
i can understand that said d artagnan   146.02606782061827
cried d artagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels   136.40876852352196
villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination   94.78664024365763
it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours   75.97547558452644
my intention was if caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the custom house officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew   181.40104459468154
but on the frontier he was met by lesly   51.5898081676052
i took then in conformity with the orders of the authorities who sent me a reinforcement of six men such measures as i thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners   77.33827581247716
twice he had overcome his doubts   148.6702151378384
her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death   14.976072134195604
giving me her hand to kiss   128.7605800330007
did i not tell you that she was the goddaughter of monsieur laporte the confidential man of the queen   104.24836389250528
he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits   92.4295054761328
you have done well to warn me   154.1814750273164
and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table   112.06814526383562
40274m morrel watched her as she left the room   110.66841657403197
the noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs   119.11437162395129
and will you sign the contract   85.71573175720982
it can not change unhappy man   125.62471352805952
cried the king is the messenger s name m   47.66166378179054
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed   159.04203365138284
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act   143.5884466776067
my lord i beg your highness s pardon but i must beg for half an hour s leave of absence   147.52548681110213
it was evident that all was not yet over   110.05968734835643
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover   100.09031201153543
the three windows were still untenanted   163.56468399646042
by heaven and earth   30.46489800655307
on descending we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view   138.62293419000346
no sir madame de saint remy is at blois with the duchess of orleans   85.76218845645374
and you would be quite wrong my dear de winter said buckingham holding out his hand to him   31.95009778161979
poor man he is a worthy creature   116.54783837585181
then you do not know who it is that attempts your life   143.5717723779856
for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me   74.30310109587245
but the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat   79.97755349327565
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish   109.80130095361743
but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a woman   148.20468550925895
séguier keeper of the seals looks more than once for the bell it is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made upon louis xiii   30.63926708209239
monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it   111.12514482870063
the woman you poisoned at béthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said d artagnan   111.2769387978067
i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol   72.80906570402473
are you not a sportsman and a great wolf hunter   115.672671763781
ah really   133.8092388654469

where is the prisoner   97.87419556831554
and what of that   103.84572054140969
but we must first learn what convent she is in   70.99291420442674
were i in her majesty s place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate   118.17218448076363
morrel attributed penelon s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire   94.50650424646273
you will return after three or four years with a russian princess for a bride and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago   182.2756831225879
in the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was exposed   154.6879128086213
for ever and ever   108.76682535200602
the young man went to her and took her hands   147.90289302035472
did you observe d artagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton   156.70858154317875
cried madame de chevreuse clapping her hands   118.3883621778552
france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eighty five departments i say eighty five because i do not include corsica you will not find then in these eighty five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp   163.44403420243418
oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars   172.09553322188992

but monsieur said mousqueton i can t swim   100.5560709545747
because in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811   105.39660198395259
his only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat   62.56730253735234
do not envy me this happiness   149.92006623316271
yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost broken winded   174.98726380268707

well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator   196.1209226652125
demanded the notary thinking he had only to insert this clause but waiting first for the assent of noirtier which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene   147.74356396425537
between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden   155.30702649835655
this is my story then   76.04653980094325
no said d artagnan   75.21976110377574

in the antechamber he trembled   148.24385411347117
but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance   171.94944119942326
well if my husband s soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter   123.40243027884837

the abbé asked one day of dantès   75.62725396566921

but tell me all about it   194.63289564132094
the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit   118.9175862896406
he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage   146.7749203955869
at whose house you robbed and murdered did you not   171.97620468010487

comminges returned to his post   161.78516848288663
the steward wished to turn to the left   84.87765312020153
he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass you ve not then forgotten me   174.23196198011254
the story first sir said caderousse you must make me a promise   121.97412431629301
vampa took cucumetto s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn teresa remained outside   85.4221184980024
madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release broussel   67.57175474472089
the demon had known how to wound him   154.4212911971593
baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of french domestics   175.28985753074411
yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you   177.50970721032508
moreover i have answered for your devotion also   80.42655953381464
or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition   131.39034473850938
said he there are two of them   143.5138920446369
she appeared to be stupefied   168.60532853316036
but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o clock in the evening   134.15027769578128
on d artagnan s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life s disillusions   135.96966327236316
i faith colonel said d artagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation   142.76243721789206
the young king approached his mother and said why do as these people ask   57.3301700723715
i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel   112.66716581082379
what shall i do now   196.02183840816934
i know the full importance of the statement i have just made and the disposition of the man to whom i have made it   116.05401921668387
oh it is nothing said monte cristo   46.02627744491039
bonacieux knocked as at the shutter three light and regular taps   90.92243983945858
yes if the thing be possible   175.557461369696
you was right said the swiss   122.39947685571092
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point   134.19389925995154
when you like   174.48812638067295
mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch   148.54215514005284
we have no time now for suspicions said athos   136.16409882848134
it does not   105.53330448554371
it would make very little difference to me said caderousse if i were retaken i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades   71.4580720887113
as they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio   133.7901214109038
it was a friend who spoke thus   86.3235143578178
and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame   131.4460793606726
do you think his uncle de winter would have brought up that young viper   119.77176826999813
day for day hour for hour said albert   52.91400422004035
that of the cardinal predominated enormously   65.40899593307566
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dantès   138.08044982096447
no said aramis he has not seen us   133.97476124865756
but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in paris   85.01298518379136
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated   148.92444678040832
i dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you   125.38650482125638
i have warned m   131.71241877511827
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine   45.47147399600648
that s true said athos   145.0742597954059
on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond   207.00622356975347
when i strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips   120.77487449703582
and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to debray   68.54828266336784
the young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the count s daughter   20.468192089331183
oh i expect him every minute   31.52497588981504
look you may see it from here at the foot of that little hill that slated roof   139.65690238771816
one fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishing boat boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the never to be forgotten night of his departure for the château d if he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither   136.26573148942407
good said he our syndic is at his post   60.975865356789875
what induces you to think so   75.99224827045208
i know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army   115.3824829783405
very dangerous to say the least   121.19656947903327
at the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to five and twenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose tree raised her head   63.09162161508201
we are never quits with those who oblige us was dantès reply   127.8996953254941
i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me   141.65537356822648
the cardinal therefore rose to open it   102.22143192966428
and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at bazin   143.47759686719417
before doing so i must consult the trial justice   118.50192357666359
i do not seek your confidence my dear friend   73.8951005905354
and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room   62.90594384442292
come gentlemen your swords said the duke   116.80237240192872
i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it   190.20205719884746
porthos turned around like a lion plunged on the dismounted cavalier who tried to draw his sword   140.05594101543142
true my lord   149.7496026279738
20125m teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felice s daughter   99.55725931553843
then we shall pay the more that s all i see plainly enough   84.95195678735612
peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier   216.67051675547944
but the name struck me because i also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him well   159.5751427116276
her   114.45162773983458
i ask no more for liberty i only ask to live   200.0456175489829
only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner   91.13895105578834
exclaimed porthos opening his great wondering eyes   143.88976716287445
yet this catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards sicilians and calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow   52.008119683468095
oh very well replied aramis   95.82434205499537
i fancy i hear horses feet   173.51475062402432
but the citizen declared to d artagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him   62.78106179743443
morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet   97.09922574158163
tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me outright   88.69803174036798
no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur d herblay and myself to madame henrietta   147.08096245916514
the young man was opening the door of the stable   160.36583413057627
and how said harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you   63.042835272018095
chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice   49.78352352327316
with spain no answered d artagnan   144.9633730438792
stop in the name of heaven monsieur porthos   91.44046228028556
the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grimaud s eyes   129.2469313914016
when i speak of ignominy you think i speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or death   128.57789072100422
if you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left shoulder   150.51238238344888
the catalans beyond a bare weather worn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the catalans   86.44012810326866
on entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him   57.308769812603735
morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves   83.05783732114091
you are stupid friend porthos   44.46121313655489
i demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law   42.66201992586697
then why did he purchase it   133.49292059418514
but madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at madame de villefort and valentine have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before   69.2700442553955
my word said de winter rising i think the hussy is going mad   157.28227177448866
will you take me away with you   49.7011032343334
i repeat to you i don t know her   128.59177322774775
mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league distant   138.17615129733593
andrea andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian name   75.75985454786303
it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman the anguish of her look the trembling of her whole frame   85.88150765621813
ask him then for the written order   168.4097438830469
it speaks of his return does it not porthos   101.0266631197626
but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and d artagnan was a gentleman   89.50217433008272
they say said aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea   136.6877915373247
your majesty wishes then you to say what you would do in her place mazarin hastened to reply   64.87721153444213
but you forget replied debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free   89.47193643619138
0125m i do not know   78.04698455738212
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures   113.54680743548577
i was executioner of the city of lille as this woman has said   123.65876558104394
but edmond s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head   125.78466315493984
but d artagnan   112.98644678753466
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here   127.58391822295249
the 21st of may at half past ten in the morning rue du helder no   104.98368248754721
is that what you would say   139.5293110714297
now we may say at last thank heaven   142.59453910825113
morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother in law   123.57893840339771
i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m   104.9607959921363
charge   69.4640025606427
they both arose and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish him gave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment   140.60009003318387
said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé   121.88922949092459
the horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the king s face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure   155.74023748274664
it is probable   142.20866256918688
only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel   134.980280168035
no replied the two musketeers after a moment s silence no sir we do not   164.43216240798913
edward begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it   124.56637245355438
well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you   112.40062712590252
then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard gate   120.36333792566406
he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard   164.29049200786773
for i criticise him without knowing what he does   147.88802864717888
i will be silent then said milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner   75.40974700430611
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate   125.54138640367208
and by doing so monsieur the governor said d artagnan you will deserve well of the cardinal   96.31793611539962
having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal s cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation   86.22743760492757
the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound   88.25202817512127
i should lose myself in the cardinal s opinion   114.87985462971757
for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it   120.01576996318715
in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for 2 000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48 000 francs which you still owe me   20.93010542211792
now that never happened to us when we were four together   142.15171689441513
the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not   130.31207964400807
i have only one thing to ask of you   62.36058244691448
but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair   175.53470430200105
they make the countess ill   144.34713791171635
oh said villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone oh be satisfied i can understand my father   93.54214788158066
you care about it then so much   70.6015838519509
i must start for paris again immediately   221.0270465465188
27 and stopped in the yard   107.18976319797451
with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no papers and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there before making in all about two hundred francs why i should certainly be arrested at the barriers   143.66022882379332
monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow   157.8428080161636
they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the shutter   125.43659150995889
where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council   109.58902803852581
my dear fellow exclaimed albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness   80.50327662106437
have pity on valentine   77.02822800101733
he took the glass and raised it to his lips   130.22270827095718
and something like a faint smile lighted the still terrified features of the young woman   174.99248643542495
he has three unlimited credits one on me one on rothschild one on lafitte   149.49617540669067
they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was roasting   64.10372063911528
and if you wish ever to leave my palace you can not   166.6831665930776
thank you sir said albert smiling   123.11440967465659
what do you say that she wanted to have her brother in law killed   176.81118576712325
what did your excellency say   112.09447130866636
from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years   109.3284263997018
the whole of the property consisting of an immense workshop two pavilions at the bottom of the garden and the garden itself had been purchased by emmanuel who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation   91.72427126033773
and by whom is this order given   108.1534948016182
in fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the city   185.56705525333564
exclaimed aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him   183.401040862638
de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor   131.33733195648566
then it is danglars   108.24860401755112
and will she be disposed to give me myself another sapphire like that which she gave me for de wardes   181.56360090538624
we shall be remarked   278.1882082977239
anyone else would have hastened to receive him   67.15526153060111
then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum   81.57640427085
devil take these civil wars   156.96018215030853
but let us make haste sir   12.514269833453255
i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries   174.2641383889831
do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately   120.66712009847036
there is but one favor i would entreat of you   138.82483120044532
one of the two guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after that   189.36899278366474
felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest   153.16889003496337
albert advanced towards eugénie smiling   140.84826257483715
you will assist me in the work will you not   143.76388036355874
morrel shook his head   78.80329944883509
my officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop here   162.74550234944957
d artagnan saluted m   47.71674501973901
let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy   30.010138046866643
the look of felton revealed to milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word   125.41687356095566
and if my glass was good and i mistake not they were foremost in the fight   30.995283603472018
mercédès raised herself on her feverish arm   178.84142289886842
and i know he has fought two duels said morrel   118.06131897362567
my husband was a great friend in 1814 or 1815 of a sailor named edmond dantès   115.36579169215628
like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger i laid in my provisions i loaded my weapons i collected every means of attack and defence   152.20378643663153
well said he what next   132.17339093809883
it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune   154.05696879947283
your highness s most devoted servant in the bastile as elsewhere comte de rochefort   102.02768142716856
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo   66.3254842583406
isn t mousqueton there   121.20965445281603
and now gentlemen i wish you good morning said monte cristo   34.507168454714204
monseigneur being of a very mild disposition and being likewise of which monseigneur perhaps is not aware about to enter into orders i endeavored to appease my comrades when one of these wretches gave me a wound with a sword treacherously across my left arm   100.23675279569287
if it were bad money there might be some hopes   65.88969349726702
in five days   154.86535045661708
with his sixteen hundred francs you remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying a letter to lord de winter he has set up a little shop in the rue des lombards and is now a confectioner   136.38915525453947
and tell him cried a voice that i am not too old yet for a man of action   103.17052579370531
porthos wouldn t have waited for it so patiently said d artagnan with a smile   91.36269047986103
experience had taught him the importance of past events   134.48169887323598
my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni   182.43883120358393
but there must be some cause for this strange scene   181.61593387112634
aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and re buttoned his doublet   121.41204416932533
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune   131.10448060511038
now i beg of you don t go off your head   95.60347424882471
he felt the need of making a trip in the ile de france and begged us the comte de la fere and monsieur du vallon to accompany him   104.84937982869087
morrel alludes continued château renaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him   97.29900569047321
athos without saying anything emptied his pockets got together all his jewels purses aiguillettes and gold chains and offered them all to porthos   106.87472451340602
said d artagnan laughing   159.6042833560515
we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray   213.54559038489248
denis or the faubourg st   70.00001322863969
with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night   115.3805999412277
see m   129.10467762918725
no but i wish to have a share in my revenge   173.54981822733163
nevertheless if you wish it i am ready to go   101.07773766526171
but the visit of porthos soon enlightened her   110.22126013301403
the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know   109.2151292676826
de tréville who made some advances on their pay   4.415256792720129
sire said winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are ready   162.8536400761269
but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber   124.9483532360264
yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy albert   161.63377163865187
monsieur says i am coward cried olivain because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in grammont s regiment and i refused to accompany him   201.36828757018912
love is the most selfish of all the passions   96.54574813626745
all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the 28th of february 1815   162.38472883345253
and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly   100.9597711901598
d artagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight   99.93269015760436
every soldier must be ambitious must he not   158.4719280536287
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man   85.25960426969864
then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes   122.25510853855354
this poire d angoisse was a famous gag in the form of a pear which being thrust into the mouth by the aid of a spring dilated so as to distend the jaws to their greatest width   132.75782031429029
happy father happy son   120.94662504196005
i always knew you were a good son   39.603903960199474
yes ungrateful to providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner   129.04504185798987
mechanically repeated the young gentleman releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into raoul s arms   63.02024668624907
oh if she betrayed your majesty on the side of your honor it would be quite another thing and i should be the first to say no grace sire no grace for the guilty   76.32271632938728
the old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes and paced up and down his chamber the whole day and would not go to bed at all for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night   30.71839382669002
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france   145.28793211722424
i see you are coveting a good draught of it   194.2855754467907
must i say baron danglars   103.5638456476463
the monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion   195.37452895094333
all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy looking room separated by a wall from the vault itself   135.1546818013804
in your arms   128.34503591911837
and what is his especial talent   91.74664608722183
somewhat   91.84405674147456
i want none   162.06529076932878
perhaps you speak the truth aramis   185.65212225188804
for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion   55.62128602072416
nothing but one word   64.90642414971936
he alone could have transmitted to lord de winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of fatalities   51.8428928550742
and then said madame de villefort endeavoring by a struggle and with effort to get away from her thoughts however skilfully it is prepared crime is always crime and if it avoid human scrutiny it does not escape the eye of god   82.86376516404746
edmond continued mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since i first knew you i have adored your name have respected your memory   127.98240120179612
then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence   123.80079256297988
his two companions did the same thing   77.74322204842832
yes if they fell into infamous hands   142.97196081146464
you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes   140.43817845774788
no madame i will not thus waste your time   135.16290525309074
it was a phenomenon of skill   114.13601900045182
this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome with whom your father does business   109.72974279523392
said he who appeared to be the leader of the party   166.98551084102849
higher   112.68757119252884
fatality chapter l   64.14856485638047
you will understand monsieur i thought there would be still time if you wish to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone   146.6076935814766
true said la ramee   184.6764615408017
at this cry andrea raised his head   152.95186139039578
you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened   64.60353285611544
but first i will state the case to them   121.0117726192636
andrea had spoken very little during dinner   84.54184317714441
d artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos and sobbed aloud   110.05106132913592
no it is not existence then that i regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously framed   51.183767811076095
ideas and men appeared the same to him said albert   86.66988659204281
albert s attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed   68.21045213520105
but woe to those who stood in my pathway   143.53142649470954
asked blaisois i can   107.17908186268451
dear albert said beauchamp   163.59891550814234
sire i can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in their mountains   74.10187119604626
starvation   211.98954060573107
and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye   64.14260626367968
in two words you will know all   55.408806588907225
then your grace knows her real name   108.45588943295047
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to find their masters   128.66068794022917
it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d artagnan s purse   120.38470434785243
his hands of which he took little care were the despair of aramis who cultivated his with almond paste and perfumed oil   145.84336738312442
this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned   117.26123019273156
six of his eminence s guards arrest six of his majesty s musketeers   181.85881829570909
sign your name my lord   176.53380991112138
d artagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts   94.06002827546436
that settles it murmured franz   131.94743327575196
it was even told me that fernand especially was terrible in his vengeance   194.28226848147665
he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughter s name   111.03707553211309
said caderousse with a shudder   133.80106004925025
you do wrong   48.92969639897606
from his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against god and sometimes against the world that is against the devil   57.7550094638894
who is this caderousse   182.77778161459742
it was necessary that d artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber   104.34788647225886
but since such men as you assure me that i am wrong in doing so i ve a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the duc de chatillon just now   158.03618033981726
how will the crown which is scarce firmly set on the head of louis xiv   103.85646824981059
and who is this third person   65.21341289983916
but i have sworn to kill that man   95.2161966299977
cried the duke will you not accept any money from me   177.90128478866922
as i was saying last night they intend me to be ransomed   137.7069478428919
meantime d artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword   130.83210719606618
d artagnan then saw a musket barrel leveled at him   125.56776236081262
for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything   167.16981521588286
their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces   112.43444652571233
there will be no obstacle from that quarter i assure you   110.48782571499314
he had friends then after five years in prison   134.55298059581952
since you left toulon what have you lived on   94.97403991999924
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence d artagnan went straight to the residence of athos   72.18827337773416
it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly   64.15492656266886
swear my son   73.7358271156958
well said d artagnan i decide that we should adopt athos s plan and that we set off in half an hour   130.76113423577198
but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father   108.51696493919528
julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning   116.26868811598933
there was nothing but gilding high and low   148.20871256654058
cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend s entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to rita s father at frosinone   64.97565312895529
the signatures were perfectly legal   62.07745777515444
the story begins in 1815   135.4513651369888
and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass   142.41722088223298
i ran toward ali tepelini   104.7291312318713
of my hundred pistoles   56.37410682396554
there said he it s done   96.49912949928554
i willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon me   61.03976806462888
not the first prince of the blood not the king s uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the blood not the prince nearest to the throne not the king s uncle i repeat but the murderer of chalais of montmorency and of cinq mars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversary instead of a man who threatened a man who smiles   91.4816437285076
i said at the time he would create a sensation here and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer   88.12451867805208
it was selim s flaming lance   88.69318663620021
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth   135.6128381921497
and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and aramis   101.37132779468934
i will however inform monsieur d artagnan of your arrival here   78.43069305332446
possibly monsieur   99.21699322354465
order of the king i tell you   150.89057575314192
then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count s chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start   148.6295538994935
it was a béarn pony from twelve to fourteen years old yellow in his hide without a hair in his tail but not without windgalls on his legs which though going with his head lower than his knees rendering a martingale quite unnecessary contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day   153.7850489070415
this insolent boy chastises others cried he   174.73118280489226
an apology on the ground   184.75668684029017
another man on horseback was galloping on that side   98.4557373688016
la chesnaye said the king   83.01663078958629
i am afraid to do so   174.97422966097457
you would then be in present possession of the letter   113.96798672327598
it was however too late   156.6201324857713
besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent   109.8786187414884
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed   122.87909608496577
there is another word which pleases me cried athos with a gracious nod to d artagnan   5.1268476887541965
the queen was still standing when he entered   96.50944623432218
but is it the custom for the officers in the english navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of great britain and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore   78.91047252914929
in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire   48.323396519911014
he sent for me to his house gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till i had reached you i have come in fifteen hours   168.237658634483
but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted   150.2262893008068
then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern   144.74582460357018
she is at châlons   110.44834184046175
be so kind as to reflect sire said the cardinal   207.79502619412293
blaisois found bazin donning his beadle s gown his services being required that day at notre dame   103.05822853324766
i descended the staircase step by step   190.8298189040417
replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civil   133.87952462876336
how can you doubt it sir   159.5616711077276
it was no longer a rival who was beloved   158.50483621424235
you have despoiled me of my fortune   34.46004629823723
aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it   164.9544893967377
you are in a shocking hurry to be off you forget one of my guests   148.58029632467668
the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup   153.76414078990325
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food   98.18275901921848
you can not reproach me with the slightest coquetry   123.64384310485217
it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villefort s was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever   124.9540337168724
felton my lad did you not perceive that you were taken for a novice and that the first act was being performed of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments   55.535779866282795
it seems a likely story to me   7.159223317960041
it was necessary   222.64189661426843
do you fear any approaching evil   170.34162561232037
come here   212.43663357411475
unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrel s correspondents did not take this view   171.33564651275557
nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry   121.77752953949249
the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly   94.17294221228569
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted   94.05184267493507
said bazin looking uneasily around   169.41032830384552
why what in the world cried aramis is that animal bazin doing   131.10192926274408
the young man pressed valentine s hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase   66.8683876668783
cried the citizen swearing in order to rouse his courage   175.25858802315804
said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men   114.79233771699649
i think i remember that you told me something of that kind   151.65961725280818
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived   135.3682734433995
i am cold sir said mousqueton   96.4092510700727
de villefort he fulfilled the predictions of héloïse to the letter donned his dress suit drew on a pair of white gloves ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to no   96.94714910567342
since you know the solution of it i ask no further   113.22078867154148
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse   132.14030143674296
the mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us   151.49582214989113
well i i m not rich   71.67113900196011
my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern   146.83077726271074
around a broken down carriage the people were uttering imprecations whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisoners that is to say an old man and two women   81.22832479165561
athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin   164.83420555304747
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens   69.08426365176578
his beard which was darker than his hair was turned carefully with a curling iron a practice that greatly improved it   211.50359624104706
stop said the duke pistache jump for the queen   134.71828050122775
no other friends left in the wide world but yourself   203.3743271079158
edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantès chamber   79.02655029629605
for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo   140.41424129251348
said lord winter   183.97414838386612
it must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor in which d artagnan lodged those who called on him were exempted from this detention   86.8486626668316
said d artagnan raising the battered hat   110.135393979688
and now now what   166.83624008053127
but i can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt   49.731422566518404
silence me   43.87025925687715
but to do this he must have spoken   132.1094816426418
but this is all i have left in the world he said out of an immense fortune   150.70769596892012
you came you say to see me   62.61349350049115
it was now athos s turn to take a sly look   123.71600410287836
he has gone said he and the house door is shut   102.32718973373922
eugénie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival   69.19687555929474
first one gun l goes under then the other   165.61919204734812
the facchino follows the prince the transteverin the citizen everyone blowing extinguishing relighting   95.75684506795561
now the portmanteau let us make haste the portmanteau   42.72955445534271
bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning   83.60479084590642
what can you expect my dear porthos   116.94151571114428
however what had you to say to me   105.48765850370204
your arm is still strong enough is it not porthos   85.56261137972534
but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you   75.20591982249073
oh the frightful brute   73.12085599685906
20277m it was unexampled for a servant of the count s to dare to dispute an order of his so the steward without saying a word followed his master who got into the carriage and signed to him to follow which he did taking his place respectfully on the front seat   128.5884566724871
they fancy that their countryman is still emperor   44.02623420722868
on the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him   202.06733155156525
perceiving m   99.10177898365487
welcome home again   218.39267451520226
and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer   115.94984202970794
aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript ps   38.359059579775675
i can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment   178.38213049092124
count count added she you know that i wait for you   132.31012852351176
my lord said d artagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d herblay who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence   77.20796757367037
i advise you to complain   73.41596684555621
athos curled his lip with disdain   100.39704895583898
and now gentlemen said d artagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for all that is our motto is it not   51.76700718403885
your orchestra is too noisy   106.43846280042929
two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides l impartial and what was more serious one that was well known as a government paper   145.32660710983208
and at this word the smile on the cardinal s lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable   83.36169202475278
i ask it humbly of you my lord said he   72.06940604079037
my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble   170.8183168429555
turning to his friend dear maximilian said the count have you nothing to do in this land   52.68622741747755
the count returned to young morcerf   92.10771796993689
i love you also you   89.65179412518579
it was not the plain white waistcoat   249.01631835483533
59   114.80017543040942
then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table   195.5222959814045
it is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me   22.998132672983985
d avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative   125.07461911822946
then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy ungrateful woman that i am for twenty years i have forgotten this man whom i ought to have made a marechal of france   111.87449605851926
raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground   116.15371164805138
he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristo s eye was on him   114.06848971282069
all looked around   116.88254707600882
d artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses   110.83969798606016
if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them   156.55006549677856
don t you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands   154.89175300490683
believe me as long as i live i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me   90.8490021714932
you have not been long detained   174.56655000239124
to come in the capacity of a cousin and seat himself every day at a good table   48.53390809963352
they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in   158.50437047021364
and is not this daughter dead   118.76321815780135
but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart   105.42360973021788
said mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money   77.29396614772216
the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct   113.30378757354876
that is why you in your turn are to die it is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his   141.5849432632279
yes all but eight hundred piastres   56.42291791136141
i i was where d artagnan stands   77.74912214111168
two or three times a week   133.35725908449456
luigi was jealous   92.66656760056217
they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is taken   35.37673323851189
but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between lucien s visit and the curiosity of the baroness   123.7495393771948
however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles   142.21905773485486
she still loves me   140.04489608372842
i know you are accustomed to assassinate people   18.43463239846504
i do not understand you said debray with freezing coldness   104.34936235818672
what do you mean my lord   91.02324779513971
he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on m   72.16862947679309
she is quite well replied danglars quickly   103.57319659295338
oh my brain whirls   147.4676498280089
one day the young shepherd told the count s steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his flock   112.16519078242754
but we four altogether would be equal to thirty six more especially as you say the work will not be child s play   54.18106958833586
ghosts at first sight the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo   47.82090313505692
the young man s trembling voice was scarcely audible   115.9957524900758
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside   127.38928564790555
he was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others   206.85492249769564
without having been in the school of the abbé faria the worthy master of la jeune amélie the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provençal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support   153.71657468282808
quick quick d artagnan   154.6544499035881
oh maximilian maximilian you are certainly concealing something from us   196.2381633127649
at length at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback   116.42304325504637
grimaud bowed in thanks   45.5856137306955
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with   164.11986999736922
and for pirates   97.79639370528284
the wind blew violently   75.31093747373022
are you after all unconsciously in love with mademoiselle eugénie   18.215060105537958
i recognize them said morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own signature   83.93835833959511
if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty francs   108.53769457735937
but said renée this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the king s attorney   53.270446444782046
she cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it   82.73799691231868
i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m   92.0694197629629
i tell you that you were wrong   108.2064197461731
depend upon it i know what i say   62.790911209625754
is it possible to insult you madame   26.800373992146106
50125m maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed   164.26420724310478
did not touch those hearts of stone   134.9255636189398
do you see that   148.85445667909096
my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil   68.52062431011774
how you manoeuvre my instructions count   109.58172172294573
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality   95.72475280411764
but having lost the horses i am particularly anxious to preserve the harnesses   65.80933328158564
go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you   127.82595750679124
with the first rays of day their tongues were loosened   126.17276085473085
is it not enough   162.3402397179023
the matter enters completely into the duties of the post   98.30981747139487
i suffer horribly   36.410090941839286
what do you say m   88.44798434293119
speak sir replied the queen   27.730679550764023
and with these words henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal raising his hands clasped toward her exclaimed ah madame madame how little you know me mon dieu   53.433864983039655
a leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead man   7.073057351886632
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us   99.42586591770723
yes madame replied the officer   193.57034125867096
the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate   63.078980175176014
a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one blood washes out shame   29.62403284243831
can you imagine said monte cristo some othello or abbé de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god   32.1809374238464
these four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power   92.64876141013252
but there is nothing which would do   156.79382484635406
i have arrived from cadiz this morning   73.16215407750806
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger   134.5283201143894
however the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter my lord your friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand   195.17351567115657
athos did the same   145.01372025944298
you who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledge and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl   64.04334923627412
yes monsieur i must   112.65628969356705
50151m i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus   147.7578078111876
his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée when suddenly the door opened   145.6770270480246
perhaps you did not see well   118.17225574286492
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme   140.42934955717055
have i travelled in that country   193.5769828265194
perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so   105.42009844814606
well said franz to his friend what think you of all this   89.02459092501857
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless   167.72815573481654
dantès appeared not to perceive him   128.02106588343966
february 5th 1815   144.38455654355903
i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man   102.0235674455906
d artagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in flanders spain yonder woman here   71.43602589577372
13 murmured he growing still paler   165.59771359337736
well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another   58.59164662671863
no no monsieur said monte cristo   124.99344725310512
bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the bastille   173.2903935520971
the more must you fortify yourself albert   86.37056121497154
i never had a better friend than you   107.21262511828911
you will find good cigars on the centre table   135.1101530554569
but what are you about there   74.2004466973492
without reckoning replied monte cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since mademoiselle danglars is an only daughter   200.1310732187851
i say monsieur that chance has rendered me master of a secret which you will guard i hope young man as your life   148.15684314400954
it is the people who do not obey that i punish and not those who like you obey but too well   156.53690779994133
she listened panting overwhelmed crushed   78.76982872929148
and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any longer   144.05320533279016
cried comminges   105.1536674398677
brute   70.6083284345266
and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed   79.96007249352758
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here   168.56411011958892
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of d artagnan and porthos in their hands   67.9353533381938
said francis i   47.893289837604115
he was a stout man of about two or three and twenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach   28.544741245995937
you have a right to be unjust to them monsieur   134.548910511111
as to d artagnan he did not budge from his apartment   90.8577145562512
it means at once come enter you are welcome   118.71859004831744
command   75.88695024634899
she turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master   75.24147311003858
but d artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers   186.83727009484414
or as you are a corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call it   55.396086574071745
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back   122.70357615071018
come in said louis xviii   102.71834751034899
the prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey   85.12613533690484
lord leven   101.89642117679159
if your daughter had committed only one crime and i saw her meditating another i would say warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying   51.12144715921086
well perhaps   165.93412270291904
he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men   87.7541483819785
in half an hour we shall be on board   90.13443035192
the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity   94.87161737201265
hullo said albert   58.66679411853254
asked the young girl with the velvet eyes   99.23348750347246
besides how do i know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite has not concerted with m   174.4365017823955
caligula or nero those treasure seekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for   78.00045034868725
by the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes   131.7994856635466
i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms   114.28179710088001
bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice   49.31504443981187
the carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horsemen   73.92625028918754
oh yes very gloomy my friend   145.3858095495383
while the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose   176.37649028096467
gendarmes i am at your service   125.76003262282391
look for on my soul it is curious   136.68964421246153
faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling   71.71113934123126
i desire but one thing in this world edmond the happiness of my son   48.620146284164775
to day flatter and caress or you are only a common woman   183.18413645983833
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them   96.39752339168388
he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality   110.18060727156441
ah my yellow horse cried he   192.49556882370615
that is not difficult   105.41216274105474
ask d artagnan   107.23502548407116
his voyage would upset him quite   136.792019628653
gentlemen we are arrived   125.42161049554954
very rich do you think   84.25859057978286
the silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie madame said he at length i pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here   177.94714032222794
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention   129.06244698202198
de tréville s private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl   34.84454071855518
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking   156.78713549099467
that makes no difference   124.58550816447973
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion   134.91903505126942
he is a bold fellow said the cardinal   112.49360968310332
but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side   123.64198997270134
let us go said she i place full confidence in you my friend   165.34446978242056
war for the king   104.39941631025131
oh you are good you are great my lord   121.69145365129026
the luck had turned and groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor   140.56285540240276
why replied danglars not entirely so   146.5252442006348
you are the king of poets my dear aramis   78.36457529580937
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear   147.05070387245885
ah i am an unfortunate king monsieur de tréville   138.08960228731902
franz essayed to smile   187.65819969742267
i will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence   127.5000259047897
very well said mazarin if i place you in security in a manner evident palpable ah   64.696497681186
oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose   145.7731664396004
the comte de la fere is a demi god   10.210249775798886
we fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by selim   105.69079902506849
i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet m   69.71885510602857
put back that weapon d artagnan   73.56000026462272
certainly i have   134.69507455043305
chapter 65   94.3964025800696
replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats   114.37127995974059

that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience and the mob retired   164.1043000414603
are you also in accord with spain and england with madame de chevreuse and the queen   118.03647666827497
i am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible   136.229544304491
she could read to the depths of the heart of this young man   122.68339319719118
well has anybody come out   70.28841971970107
i felt sure it must be you   95.21597138723811
this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric   163.11968418199965
the crowd began to murmur and approached the house   65.39186419592338

he embraced juxon and pressed the hand of aramis   122.65737415245688

nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull   143.14425134180945
in fact d artagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests   143.04131341033258

the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space   109.73065654696552
milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness   122.4859828427721
he was waiting for me at nine at the barrière de fontainebleau   82.09795628498402
they disobeyed orders   93.09995307225898
yes said villefort really count you frighten the ladies   113.647966625598
and that other gentleman   137.76896551962682
come in my braves said the king come in   175.06191888485807
but if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber   100.16898337085439
but i said monte cristo rising as he spoke i am gallant enough to offer it you   158.27970871046028

god abandons him who abandons himself said milady   4.250652198495956

30179m you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not   67.93668217089866
now i can not be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who can not speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance can not be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and can not be legally exercised   104.12024550697889
asked renée   145.00425631690098
remain here   195.70910640272643
hear me count replied d artagnan   193.28184725954992
it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis   185.2872927229814
then i paid the host six   73.29356942485876
by degrees milady became more communicative   46.41585964431776
the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder   129.7308566148517
monseigneur well well said the cardinal i don t wish you any ill   22.409896774619227

bernouin re entered the cabinet returning in a few seconds   151.33555855865382
and yet this nature so distinguished this creature so beautiful this essence so fine was seen to turn insensibly toward material life as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility   57.417891071172086
the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade   169.3417013445209
it is very evident that m   109.62291247986767
but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it   81.91737553083925
sir no and i do not know what has become of him   144.5577932482548

i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation   201.76237884545418
let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish   86.52895224344698

vanitas vanitatum   93.49501241881842
and then she added in a low voice oh heavens what will befall me   102.25577534886858
why are the glass and decanter empty   110.7872919161067

yes chimed in la carconte they will have a wretched night of it   84.34092214352685
at the manner in which felton laid the book upon the little table near which milady was sitting at the tone in which he pronounced the two words your mass at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them milady raised her head and looked more attentively at the officer   105.3089785601802
do you think he suspects   132.47320158403585
we were all so happy in the chateau de pierrefonds   117.14565299510322

albert s witnesses looked at each other   63.10902158969758
as soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river   188.34733481016607

the prisoners sometimes through mere uneasiness of life and in order to be sentenced to death commit acts of useless violence and you might fall a victim   121.7742099338208
a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders disclosing in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rapier   172.03659061988117
had not government better profit by it   92.37747574766608
besides said dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him   74.37504573971137
he has but one fault he is somewhat wilful   173.90890885802003
but he must be disturbed cried the host   56.517393332433286
the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas   250.12875314035838
as quick as thought he tore open the letter in spite of the cry which kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do or rather what he was doing   117.05212213032254
and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude   101.0175582466057
every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest thus multiplying his agony a thousand fold   40.92932044808464

these two men met at one point and that was cunning   135.02633687023499
we have still fifteen days before us said he to his friends well if at the end of a fortnight i have found nothing or rather if nothing has come to find me as i too good a catholic to kill myself with a pistol bullet i will seek a good quarrel with four of his eminence s guards or with eight englishmen and i will fight until one of them has killed me which considering the number can not fail to happen   94.47184980181635
the king was not mistaken   131.8978008109592
do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man   116.34907684141436
well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further   46.71580302766115
gaetano said he to the captain you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats   127.6624631004008
a gascon a match for cupid chapter xxxvi   87.38566961472605

when we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been   142.6237004248175
exclaimed an inspector   61.07301350828836
he was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told him   114.25439773687923
the two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them   92.25076398972847
and you did not warn me   183.42633930695564
besides they say i am already rich in right of my mother too rich even   165.75326553244253
for i assure you on his side he wishes you no good   143.50167738838783
how could i help being astonished when without having the least expectation of such a thing i meet you face to face you of whom we have so often spoken together you whom he loves with all his soul you whom he had taught me to love before i had seen you   85.92210170998638
well then the place   136.54896575248097
cried he whom they had addressed as my lord   139.45097014091556
we are among the privileged ones   71.42444634216244
in fact tightly held as he was lubin endeavored still to cry out   119.84479807321969
friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable   121.39416910431054
and now said d artagnan to athos entertain no further doubts about me   56.240773218546664
the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this dantès declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself   171.86021005170682
in the eyes of many benedetto appeared if not a victim to at least an instance of the fallibility of the law   53.0092026711745
say then father bazin the heir of monsieur maillard the giver of holy water at saint eustache   116.91270067195245
you have guessed rightly   82.73104273609698
she ground her teeth inwardly   64.08558296568361
but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred names that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart   96.18876369215448
said dantès staggered at the enormous amount   130.52673582496882
no my friend replied athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defend king charles   149.93622184845862
that i have been singularly assisted   138.79035166054058
i recognized you at the first glance   44.78278311000494
ten curious heads were glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury   164.87106276642828
i will wait until you come out   184.21553251561204
pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name   73.98579229069367
it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal   101.07575995146507
you told me to wait and hope   115.4721812392942
he left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the master or the servant   138.5908516559215
i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph   84.90352400539903
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the english   109.12435076558822
a second afterwards monte cristo appeared on the threshold   131.09024428242424
the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other   120.6187305391325
morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney piece   115.96304337215051
dantès remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abbé was mad such a conviction would be so terrible   110.04591886623747
villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lying no doubt asleep on the sofa   149.94159264226582
where is haydée   163.19809088270802
scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court   144.87904035266502
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much ill will to follow to the end his role as confessor   62.36551789131564
but you shall judge for yourself   52.81784809169948
but buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing   143.79036768145633
his majesty in full dress was accompanied by his royal highness m   96.28398908890357
well then let us go i must trust to you   56.07814768127045

i will send word to the governor   117.36704781361435
instantly said athos   101.36639769510064
my dear friend you are going to spoil everything everything is going on famously   117.29316593913484
and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence   98.50918650112564
albert was used to the count s manner of proceeding   172.06338303225544
debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do   177.26217417904243
they asked a thousand livres for him   97.01096163418181
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison   123.23676741036454
at saint mande   93.68060715684575
these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo   148.2272454871413
the water closed above his head and stifled his voice   94.918092568078
he glanced around this second grotto   161.54606143620924
ah if you could but help me if we could both together defeat their plan   130.24874851039874
on her side the lady who from time to time blushed darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant porthos   42.859008059224436
when i last drew my poniard   128.1327480974904
ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing   189.59420670943138
monsieur d artagnan made a compact with you   109.96858088468942
when he had concluded his speech beauchamp bowed coldly to albert turned his back upon him and went to the press room   25.95980674757405
just then a patrol rode up   127.8464117756016
the cardinal smiled as he spoke   96.06096414043596
he had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when d artagnan returned   67.80871086479175
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by d artagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them   96.30923030778241
and that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came   134.23415083761245
i understand you fernand   162.23137931785692
that is what i call talking to some purpose   185.8397038221762
your father was fortunate then   54.69651816108891
i can boast with truth of being an honest man   102.76415477353899
how droll it is   59.20925074689877
and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard   171.5222920193965
the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years   97.35735253527179
he will say in that case to the king that i am determined on war and that this measure is my first act of hostility against france   37.25151114415284
so call me mercédès if you please   103.67085868794061
come said d artagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our journey   155.38408280898076
and does he not live in the champs élysées   122.18208261174036
the hands among women particularly to be beautiful must be idle   145.71547381094484

at this crisis of the battle the prince who had been seconding de chatillon in the second line appeared in the midst of the fight   120.32897753307279
de villefort s promises   209.92336501839566
noirtier de villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of m   80.28447356669488
beauchamp will never retract   147.2385769506316
really i do not know what i have been thinking of i have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour   86.17529502882219
that is right replied the mendicant   133.5792346673544
laporte said anne of austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress yourself   50.29871963986622
yes said they we have promised to deliver scotland and england from him who for the last five and twenty years has sucked the blood and gold of scotland and england   62.72107710949559
why it is with him i am also going to fight said porthos   80.63015451087159
he listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the darkness   77.17774696515778
i have two horses i do not count my servant s bobtailed nag   145.22036061411984
thank you sir thank you replied the baroness   90.99257668400679

i should like however to comprehend said porthos   137.06305924568304
the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles   164.04700092682208
he was waiting first for juxon then for martyrdom   169.86059101023724
you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated   186.18809726746252
what i heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what i have seen in the other cases   87.08369443347033
the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house   29.673452256472018
two months ago you were dying with hunger   78.58923207594063
you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so   68.53295551493068
besides i have lost nothing by this journey because i see you   89.55614041333621
but how can that be   63.045585881187236
no no he said to the patron i was awkward and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness   108.0984938266403
the instant she appeared the door keeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment   204.277348040918
behind this group walked the surgeon   202.36530508675975
perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant   100.0227800428442
unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied they   238.29087891450143
first it flies then despairs and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers   55.51605034202642
oh spare me   146.0740551340486
what if her last moments were approaching and she should never again see morrel   69.75568472835079
you must go farther back   173.091699489768

still further buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english imperial and spanish armies   70.29237903519275
i will come and ask mine at eleven o clock this evening   84.7583395390105
but don t mistake said d artagnan there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may think for it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well received   135.94949828996502
greet each other then   145.3186520069478
certainly said andrea i shall not overtake my friend but i shall kill your horse therefore i had better stop   109.35770757647538
i tell you he ll go like the wind only tell me which way to drive   155.32037029979097
therefore madame i ask you to look not among your friends of to day but among those of other times   225.26243408336873
vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration   91.76687023738302
but you are deceived edmond she continued   141.09456464070274
benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week   114.421054502769
do you know him personally   161.79623516530245
the rest ordines inferiores of the ecclesiastical hierarchy bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels   100.27527491840304
i am indeed most wretched replied mercédès   107.1280055895195
vampa then rushed towards teresa   97.8387965719649
bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house and in the foreground instead of the usual paving stones half hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that morning laid down and upon which the water was yet glistening   103.3287674996554
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked   105.5693387083476
besides courage was out of the question here   165.10187827985067
the visitor either understood the abbé s meaning or had no more questions to ask   158.96822911122422
tis well said d artagnan holding out his hand to receive the money   68.5975593799349
the executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard   150.78160918197568
yes but where   125.3865430122794
rather sir before we sit down i must demand your answer   16.254245012232317
i may be mistaken but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display   75.02756514386296
in one of these risings the duc de beaufort pillaged the house and library of mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at   32.26822859854832
there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it   62.02404338336214
he is the son of one of my oldest friends the son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war   107.92098329140325
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief   182.04246681681252
it is men who drive me to death   78.8060389158065
i beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but i believe you made a mistake   131.70529672546206
yes said maximilian i recollect the project of which i highly approved   124.60839299715828
may i beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter   130.26635227752655
nevertheless to d artagnan s great astonishment the pretty kitty defended herself resolutely   210.45364296755764
my friend said she how came you here   37.70582024609827
noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another person   153.8998985926317
you always say trifles my dear athos   26.066278208520785
almost an impossibility replied the major   222.89116885640726
oh pardon me pardon me   90.77242222804496
yes moderately so   104.64739137787453
the treasure of the spadas exists   112.36096221348224
the four old friends prepare to meet again   79.820228541564
not so the servants hungry and more thirsty than hungry   199.4501461659961
of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old   132.8752187582915
i once saved your life you know on what occasion   142.4711610562967
bonacieux at home it was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king   84.75603781947474
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror   53.257386980413415
i have but one question to ask you what do you intend to do   120.95782059191667
this is capital   117.39065613046932
and yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the duke of buckingham   50.90179769898873
do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel   134.89949754456075
grimaud bowed   206.09872844420713
villefort could not believe his eyes he could not believe his reason   245.00663506783712
we must go out   47.375975282127584
i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me   143.76638999423983
you say sir said the king   93.97234327497667
what was there in it   86.7819434357831
then enclosing monte cristo s receipt in a little pocket book he added yes come at twelve o clock   51.96248042832698
therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion   167.34201498677874
sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon   104.02291734450466
at all events man or devil body or shadow illusion or reality this man is born for my damnation   183.1407472405706
very good said groslow and opened the door of the room   59.001079934132676
and when a child i often played with the son in the timber yards   79.79092920867237
you killed my father   63.0847203793291
are you mad uncle   139.0228852488884
milady appeared to have entirely recovered   132.64626307602447
de tréville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become darker   142.3667398447701
oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny   13.688011637970419
we discoursed a long time madame on different subjects   164.83336298395062
still young for he was scarcely forty six years of age he possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height   125.84481039024405
at eight o clock in the morning morrel entered their chamber   50.153633580550476
did she not love an englishman   126.04174891638729
the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat   87.51751179801359
here s the letter he sent by a messenger for sixpence who sold it to me for a guinea   49.39464114220284
my precautions were taken   27.91918138046981
my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side   69.99989459831676
i believed him still at brussels   110.66662049420137
he had neither listened nor heard   39.04605806498667
but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate   161.13715369847887
take twenty five of them aramis and give me the remaining twenty five   177.08458213372472
ah that is another case   80.92688563328718
he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain   156.1235908259785
tell them yourself that i was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st   102.34742016293372
it was a superb moonlight night   136.020984482314
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort   159.9763465101891
vicomte said athos to raoul follow the duchess   128.22083411110458

fire upon them   110.71375055002628
i was waiting for you sir said mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe   93.07737329683795
d artagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind it   36.131274027629416
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised   99.03840643178121
if you wish to know anything tell me and i will ask her   124.99726003442588
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door   85.57428810702663
friend d artagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future   156.55387859143772
better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about   83.5939709509404
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants   100.84806549432432
what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners   61.62007073243814
he exclaimed oh   113.74331121305092
but his eye vainly sought rita and cucumetto among them   120.9477481071483
before felton replied and before she should be forced to resume this conversation so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone she let her hands fall   101.67843335716773
i inherit my father s name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it   90.26616508002533
trust me said aramis do not expect to find anything in abbeville   138.952323674925
oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy   134.93407410056562
i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice   67.9949999682184
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple a cabbage for instance   37.86673638982636
he brought me up as if i had been his son and in 1814 he married   152.26443947469332
he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged   52.49320624687225
le chevalier dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted d artagnan   50.07523191534446
raoul began the examination but the result justified his opinion   171.49537092831784
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him   129.06666828978507
night overtook her   153.3522954357916
i shall probably kill you the fourth said he to him holding out his hand to assist him to rise   157.7528032393263
but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernand the very person added caderousse with a bitter smile that you named just now as being one of dantès faithful and attached friends   110.37776533391894
yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of to day and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church   98.37381898461359
that s well monsieur de tréville said the cardinal   133.03636237044145
i will do whatever is necessary   150.17654275376626
in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation   103.01938715615937
if he lost he disappeared completely for several days after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person but with money in his purse   160.2387716903774
but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination and above all that d artagnan would also be lost to her forever   188.99940428602088
bonacieux without any suspicion accompanied her   62.523468694095904

wait then monsieur wait said the king   179.11148903703594
and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady   165.09798752097316

we must pursue them said groslow they can t be gone far and we will sink them passing over them   48.90648295231135
and i am to take off the first one when i have reached a certain place   198.02149986571217
and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart   155.3571281294322
the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther   152.25183109171417
i will give you three months ere i join you   69.08099835656057
then she ventured to ask what had become of felton   201.88479045687802
from that day d artagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven   77.59459290084865
well then athos porthos aramis and d artagnan forward   50.042516127562564
an excellent idea   63.211002225291516
of a woman who calls herself your friend   74.65059721471447
from him and from my friend the comte de rochefort   135.70072054984007
caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt   168.3422536455414
old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m   131.24167660960808
albert was not deceived for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner   120.66786836683013
repeated the president   117.20708026710786
that would be very good   59.63019831722218
i have told sir murmured milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground   185.23236432294294
the count will find there a charming hotel with a court and garden   151.56376066315178
debray conveyed the count s reply to the baroness   73.584215743284
luigi vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied alexander king of macedon   108.63631779895782
and if i did your tone is too high   74.92976718527419
where did he lodge   141.38706332563993
so then sir said morrel you hold bills of mine   107.86859720896867
if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory   56.56029435423708
clearly said d artagnan we must go where they will not look for us   117.02206424766193
and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of d artagnan leaving the place free for another accuser   30.796459761499207
no no i am aware you know me   148.29801794810243
he could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of athos   107.9613731106151
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians   171.76476775978267
ah replied monte cristo since that is the case i will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration   114.10748185528605
do you know where i shall find him   138.8087527046966
morrel hesitated to advance   107.68683610332829
have you then who have calculated everything with such nicety have you forgotten to calculate one thing i mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to   38.848770398928764
they sent him a magnificent supper and took his million   108.83124197857143
how is it concealed   113.88682164709745
so that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew   76.30997593250987
let us to bed   119.73112711601678
that is it   197.04931640456363
with pleasure   132.18413922719233
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth   14.152796107086786
do you wish to go to m   111.08919467783168
d artagnan began to be touched   120.32500875679985
i should never have thought of that said porthos and yet it is very simple   126.67618954072692
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable   138.95383628367668
a cold perspiration burst out on villefort s brow   71.32971692749621
if i had known that i was to have the honor of your visit i should have procured the gardener s ladder   112.56133285018689
they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious   163.84488990391128
you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways   164.8794007937646
it was now cromwell s turn to look fixedly at mordaunt and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable   50.376441228708615
mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside   148.93765252248684
speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door   152.96293837226125
hold your tongue hypocrite said andrea   76.57740918312213
well no madame this is the terrible news i have to tell you said villefort in a hollow voice no nothing was found beneath the flowers   37.311508107555696
none of the lads of pampinara palestrina or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion   158.1635118623941
today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony   134.01328338518238
ah in truth madame to do that i must forget the hour s conversation i have had with you which is indeed impossible   103.27353797795483
replied m   137.40632089685084
on being left alone with mme   146.21448122283883
just as he turned a hand rested on his shoulder and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed good evening maximilian   70.42115178540757
the dying man collected all his forces   49.3289824840719
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m   89.70219110247194
d artagnan desired planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared   111.18687769155488
to be sure to see you   161.60540668399153
how do you know that he does   126.21457971912456
and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love   168.94344963980387
this is the name of the lower class   175.16213461729325
but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would   1.1888680761016701
the journey has given me a devil of an appetite   131.96366425930452
he has been sent by cromwell to mazarin and the queen guessed rightly   61.55534628076563
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island   116.87674768861811
your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man   112.71725247269337
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one   53.49809341146
supposing this person wearied at the inefficacy of the poison should as monte cristo intimated have recourse to steel   41.32853209897338
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you   96.06180052986065
morrel accompanied the count to the harbor   124.2560136713796
said the voice in a threatening accent that i had never yet heard   73.48589134932462
noirtier seating himself i might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of february and on the 3rd of march you turn up here in paris   211.7879888587536
she opened and found the word secret   63.73337099421514
exclaimed d artagnan with a look of astonishment what danger   166.0680379659862
or rather tell him nothing   114.64285461986502
how can not be   109.86892920939196
this time danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speaker s meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide   159.69356516335742
true said louis xviii   68.07045620150362
i wish to speak with him this evening   111.7477307706765
god has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get free   95.38842984999427
the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses he saw albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need   176.8663641415772
i thought for a long time that he was dumb   153.89822413721058
fifty thousand francs a year said porthos   136.94527737986866
gave him   139.02738748094959
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again   58.60825719450909
why he is a second ariosto   86.96508986817908
said eugénie in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary   99.85699927096066
on the other bank replied the executioner   130.64324740787274
there are tears in your eyes   90.16216621895147
you have understood me then dear monsieur d artagnan said milady   40.3649328695019
said d artagnan what did i tell you   161.43693025011953
one of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it   100.68179822761334
adieu then   56.293412783425964
doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours   69.89833146141214
there is a proposition almost like it in the augustinus of the heresiarch jansenius whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the executioner   130.50954372531714
for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance   207.99297620000132
d artagnan burst out laughing at the idea   129.81146952851753
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground   135.45418720285352
haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow   85.32543599582023
fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body   129.11467607853538
murmured the old man clasping edmond s hand convulsively adieu   53.25151159714106
then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan   136.94580663866816
excuse me sir said franz since m   34.1791457100023
that is impossible replied the governor   107.88807752681984
some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right   67.27745073790028
placed where he was d artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis   124.14041706966432
well i hope you will make a handsome wedding present the day you marry mademoiselle danglars   90.73975239945423
the 21st of september will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time arrives and it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to give you till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other   136.08903238305737
but does your grace know that the name of charlotte backson is not the true name of this young woman   103.04595331439754
and so on progressively   84.32275025122098
it then seems as if my hand grew heavy as if the cutlass was still in its grasp as if the water had the color of blood and all the voices of nature the whispering of the trees the murmur of the wind the lapping of the wave united in a voice tearful despairing terrible crying to me place for the justice of god   68.24565722347003
by his manner sir and his age   76.40953875119885
we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as before   0.11913659598744175
if they go out to day as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour   3.7281288981195075
i have taken the whim into my head   112.39644261375909
whilst this went on porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry   154.7559936980146
it is easier and less noisy than the door   87.46801314103332
thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party   96.90451553060026
the surgeon declared that the situation of the musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood   107.948508348871
i have no seconds on my part monsieur said d artagnan   88.7091410498717
for the last week m   104.65866180856698
so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here   99.08241760819547
a glass of wine will be extremely welcome   107.5505290034448
one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st   155.56232649021516
my lords answered he it is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity   196.4005027782603
i trust to him from my heart   89.82807199015035
she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to speak   62.84853183665148
the cardinal s house had no secrets for me   65.80573793292045
are you a friend of villefort s   145.41718144880673
let us say no more on the subject   109.6855291776767
augustine and gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet i can well understand that a father s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son   33.20123971584022
then he mentally added still my unknown protector   91.99331664936453
but i am really glad to have seen such a sight   119.8294286850116
exclaimed d artagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or position does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier   99.47715834325487
the englishman was an original   72.87294206891147
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye   208.8346100729081
certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it   117.85778807790254
the general drew himself up clinging to the curtain   111.20745126283599
he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you   140.11119538896372
why then should it be less daring in the future   152.72182906060624
fortune is precarious   131.49270724159894
tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night there   107.27589114965018
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow   140.99166016265946
i believe not   46.09367542257864
but continued aramis bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired   93.45770613519765
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival   73.53436103177313
they might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks   133.18545505673393
on the contrary i think it very easy   122.15119296964632
a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long athos will act   277.8761313856607
besides if they forget i shall take the liberty of reminding them   100.69040515416432
gentlemen said he monseigneur s order is you know to conduct that woman without losing time to fort la pointe and never to leave her till she is on board   90.88282650705924
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign   69.2552525329038
in prison   96.37612023119027
he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand   122.88641881258691
more than that we shall have a tempest or i don t know what s what   70.9586147862943
aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet   103.76822421329614
general d épinay died five minutes after   150.99787030195765
and he tapped thrice two taps close together and pretty hard the other after an interval and lighter   98.98004995995218
while d artagnan was examining mme   89.82975486374725
can you be a coward   107.13346476502102
this is his description benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for five years to the galleys for forgery   107.38839269796512
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter   119.47924867413504
the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything   140.35458717521885
you are sure he will keep his word with me   102.75738012505424
the young lady went towards madame morrel   149.3875986051699
you are a lieutenant   89.29414159596561
may i promise your custom to the successor of father marteau my lord   146.93909559119706
lansquenet for instance   167.59009518557593
i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole   109.62700642368307
you can now have confidence in me after what i have done   160.50963902876364
let him have his say d artagnan said athos with a smile of sadness and contempt   41.12377859397748
while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune d artagnan related how aramis being wounded was obliged to stop at crèvecœur how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner and how he d artagnan had been forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach england   93.56422410477157
well thought d artagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my fault for it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage   41.72086340618792
he appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate all   121.866046633899
i desire to know what is the meaning of this   140.0009588068323
she passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word will m   32.63963726420613
said porthos sobbing i believe i m crying   101.80222372810034
she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity   170.6422773928752
cried milady forgetting her usual presence of mind   134.76219396394225
said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited   147.78950897520045
bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian   142.69567070505528
upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son   185.6251678109022
albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking room on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down   62.910907720252645
you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness   79.65494554610065
he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword   137.019750316277
too true too true   238.49393181678036
you speak charmingly said porthos   91.39488639105969
and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles   32.16872001019398
but i will save him   131.0000363660672
but to his great surprise carlini arrived almost as soon as himself   56.031168328172626
i will say continued the count that he followed and watched you the whole time and when he saw you leave the house ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself   109.80281064668361
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock   8.106307929171152
the breakfast chapter 41   149.33061618024672
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations   155.12057858183738
what news   95.86021461994076
or rather you remember it   111.12418427523353
we have made a wager a wager which could not have been foreseen and of which i defy anyone to divine the true cause   122.94500264052036
whom do you suspect   130.34905535631805
namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown   122.65371176321095
thanks m   201.88714161992857
very well said the prince   128.0033877652893
and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence   70.58827961463112
at the door they found the carriage   15.980225294055344
owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet the pauses between the performances are very short the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume when necessary while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps   98.71409914654087
god has supported me through all   118.01475584610583
god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space   99.85903567911382
let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak   76.36558442963585
but who is to make four hundred pistoles   86.19147802612048
yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line   164.67167591126324
said the lady laughing   209.60005808806554
yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for monsieur de bracieux is rich   30.588501592283507
but now we must part   79.81310998046797
my sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses   45.394869435811344
immediately m   15.96655445132042
and at this moment i have absolutely nothing to do   118.88343821516722
a nobleman retired from service is he not   188.45038939907533
thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice   93.29328878245805
fortunately i have them though said monte cristo   136.12550241327762
the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred   73.25555766528298
the old man recognized his child and carlini recognized the old man   131.2307773702617
let us dine then said porthos   143.8243438997821
come come calm yourself   155.3838985282419
lord monsieur   137.73186752344972
i did not know that replied m   149.30208786375556
afterward monsieur de tréville fought with others in his first journey to paris five times   197.62319112925002
some straw they said   153.53175812472318
the first rendezvous was fixed for the following wednesday at eight o clock in the evening precisely   105.80746467784363
then the court once safe i might be forgotten   186.9287953953559
germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom d artagnan had often remarked this   125.87651240182947
perhaps you never before noticed him   77.4010067952525
farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full gallop   94.9054607119688
he wishes also to have faith in his queen   115.97174262276404
he left the saucepan   90.54555550481064
but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter   155.6447444590439
it s the same thing cried the young woman   122.64389940079934
thought porthos casting a glance at the three hungry clerks for the errand boy as might be expected was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table in my cousin s place i would not keep such gourmands   186.1500490133525
make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest son s welfare   72.04543267563247
in that case take care   210.11985077666296
i was sensible that i could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance   125.42099244963197
monte cristo gave him a glass of water   42.431033362993674
why should i risk an imprudent step   201.58142929248697
however there are plenty in the world but you don t look in the right direction for them my lord   209.1430399410686
but at the same time i perceive it would be overwhelming for me   115.94538183090377
and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love   104.43860298986132
but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty   110.80902920107786
out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation   134.20349523077132
if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received   191.38109789470727
from the count   54.168647278265645
pray do so   129.48415268971556
without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel château renaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m   78.07907136384767
at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine   96.84404373223721
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental d artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance   66.7579578942946
and porthos heaved another sigh   132.77744664122883
in spite of his prudence d artagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below   80.7161937534442
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise   114.35569178938935
he proposed the conditions the two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pistoles   81.82006036952885
does that astonish you   150.10152613034137
assuredly said d avrigny   124.68381303269965
said monte cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you m   145.41257958614602
as he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the darkness   143.77343760941417
i have nothing to save for your majesty   73.60107738234126
well i sold my shares the news got out and i no longer sold i gave them away next day i find the news was false and by this false report i have lost 700 000 francs   120.49733700632751
was not this murdered man an old galley slave   153.69051972760207
give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i am looking for   106.0494544405266
in what year   96.95634035615794
beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which albert pointed in an undertone   65.00474704341437
bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so i can not walk   135.78057844894
olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket   114.99285974838556
peppino glanced anxiously at franz   93.51456951001555
she appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal   65.52689265464925
d artagnan breathed again   97.31002390614204
mesdemoiselles noblet julia and leroux executed the customary pirouettes   220.3582385113508
i have only one thing to say to you   72.49931100284545
athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria   128.3206915696916
they won t devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all   91.11262021988527
the first idea that occurred to milady s mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant   101.10157438963569
laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty   160.8399910207127
but only as no   92.51916466155662
and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions   121.31823838895163
i possessed a thousand francs   171.93406436216296
on my word said albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge   1.2901625155519554
why that is a fortune   123.29773790646537
va bene   60.689997944371356
is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the duc de beaufort has arrived in paris   54.9486909294875
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful   193.52223389878864
besides if they do we can easily make an excuse   96.58320273737664
in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use a sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open   123.18797986873365
two or three bottles fell and were broken   140.72881968976156
madame said bonacieux who had never seen his wife in a passion and who recoiled before this conjugal anger madame what do you say   116.44249692648113
true they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue   167.14171182413207
the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before him   98.2204028174244
how they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners   67.41088746112023
a stepmother is never a mother sir   210.97455460727838
no monsieur he has not a lady with him   158.00072709177894
well then you shall have it   42.6533749104009
i was saying it was very interesting   144.34129569010355
demanded porthos   110.34197093231424
perhaps replied d artagnan   124.57949411081114
which i have put on some vine leaves to please you wicked one   32.185561448431045
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed   162.52906170359202
returned the captain   125.5631761324014
debray who both mount the minister s arabians   109.91448949643741
you raoul not sleep well   138.0213830363222
i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it   155.51107415924423
as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter   73.34412116559173
said d avrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to you noirtier did not let him finish   103.8416555324693
replied la ramee your supper is ordered   119.29482106602737
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat   171.90857403548384
he said he was going to the catalans and he is going to the city   0.9297706531962859
d épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m   94.56116006112362
the striking points of his face were effaced   14.434602101592759
the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle   227.77813529611157
dantès himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb   102.56460268841307
he is the cause of all this misery i am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars   30.47381893570676
i am a straightforward simple man   112.05456060245452
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at d artagnan   51.3584718213031
that you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day   111.56644642602089
you need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain   177.91807687403315
0263m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the grave diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped   157.0735595462558
have i deceived myself   105.04764520209521
i would ask for six months in advance under pretence of being able to purchase a farm then with my six months i would decamp   174.80362258402013
they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments   223.05872818495556
is the countess up yet   3.5536736768907247
but this time the pretty kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed she took him gently by the hand   153.67266422033126
then extending his hand the old man said   140.40837621845378
within two leagues of this place at the inn of the red dovecot   171.47029659483277
perhaps you would contest his right to that title madame   164.13793043665262
may you tell me whither   56.98041927262277
but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband   109.34054650248972
ah i miss three they were here last night sir i am sure they were here i counted them   120.46421709908557
on hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard   85.91087585068121
saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance   179.35247573504842
shall you keep it or send it back   87.90680344332424
in the navy   124.1947893959968
why did you deceive me   173.78008514594282
the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons   67.61898521605852
guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier   119.4304790310794
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead   187.93763907210737
she gave it to me herself   93.02633741114742
well said franz this time m   162.885870137129
my mistress wishes much to be present at the trial   110.48118880989037
well i fortunately recognize you   83.66008330863053
and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness   155.94042715962107
do you know the assassin   145.47455341388374
but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured   26.06801607884691
in the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met   91.72903627262646
take these documents then   165.21857133392132
too late   133.74199750493784
the abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up   102.86558009049494
well if you will have the truth and me too   82.21411700531868
this was the orthodox phrase   144.61168935578632
danglars signature chapter 105   125.63545952549015
yes no doubt but improved upon by ours   110.16989943959942
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to d elbeuf   151.55068252943852
the minister of police giving way to an impulse of despair was about to throw himself at the feet of louis xviii   89.92219697990211
it must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of mme   97.76195812292107
i see you have not forgotten the name   68.94029968394057
supper was to be served at three and the clock of st   94.267854399263
how should he be   35.46974669860468
the company looked at each other in consternation   101.88313597788955
and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents   174.7170531169429
lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart   109.80555091267912
the examination chapter 8   76.86898203198474
will monsieur remain long with us   143.8933121331787
some one   168.6459235466649
bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder   168.35921736634316
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a well stuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward   181.34466805915463
this knife was my only hope   174.5908928858956
what is the matter with him   67.0688026428351
your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you   103.22281553393101
at least said the abbé i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been   165.8950937536883
indeed you are such an extraordinary person that i would not answer for it   181.0918478964495
as for the théatre français you know of course that it is nowhere   163.90288509606438
well what have you to say   212.67279230760397
cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master   180.0618436171534
i have an inventive mind   120.7275048351535
ah you virtuous men   171.38847904738898
for my master   149.24787346906461
scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye   123.77883071212406
and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance   81.11389656194591
and he saw the little yacht now like a sea gull on the wave continuing her flight towards corsica   38.473366322740176
he has returned said he   48.19955287816198
swear it   140.8770645628345
jealousy gnawed his heart   120.13314901243639
the three valets passed without accident   125.04519483199792
yes and now i shall be more calm   85.97638073730533
and the young man s voice was choked by sobs   141.61457530307234
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor   120.29628305172436
that if the astrologer in question made almanacs i would advise him not to buy one   130.39497496611145
the choice is easy   139.2461435559677
of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful   103.01432566704348
julie wished to accompany him   57.68908654944454
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she   85.47238758721222
you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him   93.77968311332211
cried a hoarse voice   125.04625452801561
cried d artagnan he s just the man i count upon   70.0037197744324
and the spaniard who had advanced to meet raoul aimed in his turn and raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip   32.75776403770767
unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood   77.32340420642177
a most lovely creature upon my soul   126.09611624096824
and he added turning to porthos here s a gentleman who s of the same opinion as myself   30.68718139520928
sterlets said château renaud are only found in the volga   115.97459786821275
so that porthos will be a baron   125.90652739387254
a summer ball chapter 69   90.01707336041726
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud   92.7914362141438
saying these words d artagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interested his debt and his life   71.6114623806056
no replied villefort   157.75114000207623
the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred   101.1061140681263
nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain   181.71583550658306
that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man smiling   160.84391256537043
i really think i must have been frightened   39.80387261299785
then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine   129.6537969245001
i take that god to witness at whose feet i have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years that i would have sacrificed my life to you and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it   107.9917831372722
danglars said   85.41173142800336
there now again you degrade me   154.5445523696156
adieu then to both my good friends said d artagnan   91.86502280484818
bonacieux had named mandé because mandé was in an exactly opposite direction from st   148.25799194002994
i am bored   88.54732110052521
i would not wish for a better to sail round the world   79.99319151742552
quiet was at length restored   153.802199807512
and the drawers   125.35905146937593
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion   15.599681430268362
and quite a national one too replied albert with gratified pride   76.42304692283119
in order that there might be no confusion franz wore his peasant s costume   188.069641352144
perhaps she is pretty   148.1917511289227
there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill   56.11501039982234
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed   173.47597233586043

one day when he arrived with his head in the air and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold he found the soubrette under the gateway of the hôtel   64.97661965169169
then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god   68.19310444651649
after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of   135.96124212931002

exclaimed mine host i did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill which indeed they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves   106.39253573306839
here i am said the young girl who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely   22.57613435283534
it was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole body   116.01201710920886
oh i consider her perfectly lovely she is just my idea of what medora must have been   101.7016912737424

in short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not accustomed   161.06027606502246
besides although the ballet was danced the evening had scarcely begun   66.19778359535565
d artagnan did not draw his sword   136.42279775942137
you accuse me of fear   133.8525299529705
the steps even seemed a parti colored sea that was impelled towards the portico   50.282967767157515

it must be the fog rising from the river said the king   154.66679260143175
even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy gates rolled on their hinges they had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning   67.20587655406038
it is a prison within a prison   155.27412542476944
we have had a narrow escape   50.461723102493266
noirtier and returned to the sick man   153.19585264488632
you are mistaken my lord blood will flow   99.8217475923129
you would think they felt some remorse   140.52102981495187

although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all d artagnan wished   79.10164761638305
but i was mad to utter such a wish   142.23345851761746
show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either today or tomorrow and that i am to follow the person who presents himself in your name   132.98596503162446

it was about four o clock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant out of doors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern   111.09202743849603
a watered liquor made from the second pressing of the grape   167.98475140300636

whichever of the three you like i have no preference   127.74877632045526
i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions   96.31839492521594
you are a provident person i see   152.1522334439897
ah he s quite another sort of person a formidable gentleman indeed   105.42564418942098
but what do i know of your parisian husbands   85.77758395460974
come and help me   129.95316352377264
instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper s reign   79.51576500829853
gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most likely   59.641086756816215
needless said the englishman   148.6339308104068

you monsieur d artagnan   62.64597210182271
all my oil is lost   220.13573764929708
he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one   85.84243930054389
i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist   125.14373169215587
well be it so let us part said mercédès folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere   68.61281721696663
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet d artagnan   114.38575792259955
what could that mean   122.86146271944303
he embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed emmanuel s hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for cocles   147.4993553649754
do not be in such a hurry to do that said valentine with a sad smile   153.18062453783324
and there is an old proverb that says traveling trains youth   79.09881191064832
but who knows what has become of him   170.92178996537075
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth   95.25172370716685
as to the duc de bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to paris in a litter   88.61625494055221
i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not   188.7070748104714
they continued to threaten but they began to disperse   179.8885978806939
and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen   74.37656899146549
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn   104.33267558843015
tis a last resource but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for   97.65801933155376
he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth   115.29470354532963
this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy   140.86993359807553
de tréville after having written the letter sealed it and rising approached the young man in order to give it to him   88.70611320233613
said villefort in despair   97.5567134993623
cried d artagnan i doubt what you say   35.63182349111247
d artagnan pretended astonishment   123.62318275139174
it drives me to despair said fernand   84.44521058625469

signor pastrini came to the door to receive his guests   159.51162076307048
she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect   78.60614727330517
d artagnan then related the poisoning of mme   168.60661995705775
valentine blushed but did not answer   106.73251121367332
the air the fresh free air is so good   118.82811602262902
and when he shall have informed him and monsieur laporte is come   67.68498082393627
i wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment i felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell insensible   140.3373094910889
i can refuse nothing asked of me thus   105.86088326670543
mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head   125.40101077832998
but queen henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions crossed the cabinet opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinal s numerous guards courtiers eager to pay homage the luxurious show of a competing royalty she went and took the hand of de winter who stood apart in isolation   127.84714948787827
but it is already five o clock so make haste   62.237172786886234
said monte cristo wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him   118.03555912071083
however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to you yes certainly interrupted monte cristo   54.34026086691411
i shall still take precautions   102.3001623124093
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window   143.3911138860691
he is and he is not replied athos   155.95411442959923
after some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by athos   185.31000064989132
the one i mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by accident   121.04606018645867
raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse   133.75092969140758
madame broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their father s arms   154.13762371584744
and what   98.04542001063581
we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant   104.97930425893273
carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of firelight   101.22980216777553
and i doubt as was the case with polycrates whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us   83.59280624691743
said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be   76.90337978879427
tell someone to bid her come here that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count   135.6116597075303
she then arose and with altered voice ladies said she wait for me ten minutes i shall soon return   86.06659084815227
you are a good fellow and a kind hearted messmate replied edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions   141.4019503254927
i will therefore proceed   162.40006006756602
are you sure we are on the right track lieutenant   103.8950094797066
and its aim is   103.44901925553911
la carconte double locked the door behind the jeweller   184.71169263190973
very well said d artagnan his eyes aflame battle   184.62867943554605
why then only see   127.93026388256763
mazarin thought for an instant   47.36872779983551
noirtier the senator   183.37528694434172
and you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other   76.18820871995041
the cardinal pronounced the single word hanged   119.23288885524143
although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper beauchamp as it sometimes we may say often happens was his intimate friend   137.47155999141006
beat the messenger   52.12671309944967
albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the door   242.10217850235296
he is really out sir replied baptistin   182.7641917272723
from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchen garden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market gardeners at a yearly rental of 500 francs   136.81826028999268
about five minutes replied the captain   127.60558538196312
at this letter the eloquent eye of noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop   123.51252651522833
i have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his actions   110.32783535707199
why he is a very devil this béarnais   107.59881539884768
20181m this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the count s box   160.96187146112405
but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider   80.32981174890293
here is my pass countersigned said the latter   151.5793340394231
what could explain athos s having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table   153.74610685782767
i say nothing about blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses   158.41454613347005
one word one single word more doctor   108.2024043309917
that s love or i don t know what love is   63.55355237858501
i should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years   121.38962932789173
on his murderers   125.44545548928538
and you will leave the command to him   112.30828597748236
nothing more easy   62.628670266945676
aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion   125.62932861435252
have the goodness to send mine to athos s residence   166.89784346363646
and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose   92.86117558324656
but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto   145.76104951033525
to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers   189.8609618888368
one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion   154.64107423631316
remember your oath   72.06045305056008
what the mercer s wife of the rue des fossoyeurs   146.46329370318514
bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger   48.417885397153455
interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders   42.644031756632515
she prevailed upon him to leave the country   49.840266865819515
the count had spoken correctly   200.3662813144182
with the greatest pleasure   137.05426942047097
the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir   56.0691047922538
unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know   55.8011089993837
the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth   191.91651943909102
dantès was on his bed   174.88637938710448
and said madame de villefort i need not ask you if you share that fancy   136.83216216785198
continued athos   115.72690812500669
his fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself   72.10341354938241
if you forgot his features you would know him by that hand into which fell one by one the gold pieces of the merchant el kobbir   129.8634284229734
the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday   141.01059019473522
give him a lesson debray   118.62214909139038
monsieur duke said the king i understand you   129.15675541319206
every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the paris churches rang out the te deum   77.00093771478072
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on   82.44678783673157
the boy found him sitting where d artagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary   27.244694136372402
and where   131.61994829454247
but your release can be managed   102.27638644997096
no but it agitates me   38.31350046539805
on the cross i swear if i ever leave this place to call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race   196.66766764074575
all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all   165.63679296144466
the delinquent had escaped to the rue des lombards and rushed into a house   145.77036436730566
at the sight of carlini cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand   46.41709441901607
chat between brother and sister chapter li   143.42780956523922
shouted d artagnan   168.39878851702093
the abbé smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dantès   73.16096510215475
and you understand what brings me here   134.9582522350955
row porthos row   52.99020121498629
it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers   89.2067555802823
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time   181.1414453426903
saturday   102.39904039842564
i wish to consult you on this passage molli fugiens anhelitu you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf   74.70485067518618
delacroix s arabian cavaliers with their long white burnouses their shining belts their damasked arms their horses who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces   97.49540100308049
morrel concealed himself behind a door   132.9544986203898
well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal   147.111917830876
one might have fancied him an apparition   110.03658554608737
morrel had not readily given up the fight   80.93905738611721
de villefort how would you advise me to act   99.35799223653254
my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one party i am for fresh air   66.2145593240018
all at once a tall dark gentleman just like yours d artagnan   137.2394310527523
and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter   102.34731731900314
said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly   135.2112372050049
but what are you doing   79.56705493252016
that is right said the old man   126.24059945396236
the siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that direction   178.10139845425005
asked morrel arresting his hand   112.74484300862892
i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag   114.38473711960256
i know nothing about it myself   87.78619581744255
we may sleep tranquilly   192.42895455286595
it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary   68.42072855052625
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream   51.52157462395943
but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation   152.20747325776176
as morrel and his son embraced on the pier head in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face half covered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentry box watched the scene with delight uttered these words in a low tone be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds   222.77717588994315
the prince awaited him there   85.19261725547675
and when he has done i will if you like send him to you to brush your shoes   185.53583666843002
he could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long   179.52003876085362
inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the rue saint honore   65.31110698233924
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me   66.49421223029341
who occupies number 3   150.8943959357673
of course of course said the prisoners   154.00938053388228
said d artagnan whom the positive tone of m   115.99882003542083
either i misunderstand you or you are very shameless   93.32753215200256
asked athos of porthos   128.81056918359653
as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking   69.64672617230116
yes continued the cardinal   140.9681853522543
yes let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master   107.91865864718609
but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort   118.89400360687372
do you absolutely think that the palais royal is the abode of gayety   68.59147910177396
i faith aramis believe me there is little left to regret   63.61047585325514
ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine   225.71044723168353
go and look for the comte de la fere   152.2972804271569
and then i swear your trial will be summary   126.40708413027363
will they dare to arrest a man in his majesty s service   108.39401474556229
your wounds are mortal   123.54927943496905
you are my own darling child valentine   103.46189457208246
certainly your excellency   85.39558959278462
noirtier seeing barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man   147.53800558026188
they heard the cause of the disturbance   106.14498020385484
and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward   203.95155828076128
then you are vexed with the engagement   54.068402954795665
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of it   116.49358715030809
you were right my lord said felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of milady you were right my lord and i was wrong   94.8772883438777
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations   83.50203823957195
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind   128.758501570627
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt   89.9621218308689
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty   91.85636644096861
they would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me   143.49972087904445
there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis   70.49343897325008
i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection   193.542799054149
now is the time when baron porthos would be useful   83.0391555519254
he would not however yield immediately to the young man s request but made a few conscientious objections   149.4297085068902
but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him and for the first time in his life d artagnan who had till that day entertained a very good opinion of himself felt ridiculous   201.79011144044182
ten minutes afterwards general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves   126.6146128330326
captain said he just now carlini would not drink your health when i proposed it to him   93.80870986156494
un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin   98.07639320987548
could de rochefort have forestalled him with athos   93.38424620104423
then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty   129.41607514194732
morrel is in his room is he not mademoiselle julie   119.35783360443486
madame this is precaution not impertinence   66.89900915775115
what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything   164.92098932871536
it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fête   125.19846997619926
the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor   101.84047375051051
no other than your friend monte cristo   137.09858304778462
yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great danger   91.86581566200381
but cried morrel this purse is not yours   130.16263962196288
yes go   121.96288470602
still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders   113.4908216499385
you are really suffering and these ladies will excuse you   43.123428131376585
i can foresee that we shall have need of it directly   104.03971501538766
cried the distracted mother rushing toward villefort   198.31606592073135
the steward appeared at the door   126.77619226163495
30133m indeed   102.74542802705741
i have a miraculous balsam for wounds a balsam given to me by my mother and of which i have made a trial upon myself   126.55050778498307
you judge yourself with too much severity   136.00508835345056
just so gentlemen   128.98368468683668
continued the count be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an account of the execution   139.67839424136776
he probably had succumbed   85.87863578604102
well said renée i can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician for instance   130.984811897735
0051m fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out   74.45001625483579
well my husband would never live in it   181.77623514764036
and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen whether she smile or weep everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of the city of paris   36.62453186290338
i have no time to lose   109.16832353093564
chapter 56   117.40350634393309
but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of down with mazarin   119.83454934216138
will you allow me to speak to you of her   73.07701542897868
900 000 francs   59.0225880205367
judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied athos   159.98455936870945
de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man   131.71416070550927
40138m you must wait for what   102.83768942777753
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you   139.886820866222
long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day   116.83096642922628
and her son   149.15915498834167
i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you   169.62394152228197
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion   115.46223427103952
i want a hundred pounds and as for my own and he emptied them inside out   48.765213025622046
another the illustrious mazarin acting the part of ignatius loyola in a tragedy of that name   60.272585016151226
deuce take those italian princes   169.34223437467784
cried porthos they have not even pursued us   99.74068242357409
all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul   181.11684357048708
when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track   55.94479916389601
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat   125.2942672689705
said mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect   92.79550693470985
but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady   230.67688275353254
it is enough replied the prince   118.25946517561754
what you had one   149.74605059354656
she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent   97.46929608676425
all this looks suspicious   136.71376237780922
consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent   79.76919371663928
as for me said porthos i will see to the supper   118.36401471472279
i warn you that i will never again work in the dark and that i will know not only to what i expose myself but for whom i expose myself   113.75894812827352
it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children   109.18341408900872
as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you   144.91554638416898
with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties   182.5171601779223
ah said louise breathing freely here we are out of paris   41.94831573324079
i feel myself called upon to treat that and no other   69.77495246535305
observed valentine   28.304145268903667
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story   99.00298482175413
what says the abbé   70.24168581443911
morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last half hour to tell me that if his ship the pharaon did not come into port on the 15th he would be wholly unable to make this payment   99.28986339422137
then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son   137.765193982285
apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor voiture do you know scarron   134.4868048707993
at pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine o clock galloped into the yard of tréville s hôtel   138.8523132423702
it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which i am endowed i am approved by a man like you fresh from the court   129.24345031106884
inquired the abbé with an ironical smile   117.28185004985112
but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and d artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince   94.77152229277671
those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm   37.47200547128563
noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke   85.29982911006508
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of buckingham   77.50016584650622
not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying   99.5101586106858
to his friends m   108.01238013758571
ah my dear sir you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person   123.8023272381009
but it was very late   67.44591069507334
so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs   111.49812646508896
it is what i have just reproached you for   68.37991381023934
stammered dantès   84.90424118676711
do you know his abode   101.90960900555467
4 and he your excellency is poor peppino   49.59039204973776
do stay added la carconte in a tremulous voice   87.33396157843566
never forget me   112.05593441821026
however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor a cockbill the jib boom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot   62.38847664096481
tomorrow morning at seven o clock you will be with me will you not   158.72961250473284
he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians   123.94786017527133
the crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee   107.21294486204766
my horse was killed this morning my lord and i am mounted provisionally on my lackey s   111.58743192313389
but either i was deceived or hell has resuscitated you   185.20175193671903
we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child   90.32979302549938
the blow was parried   198.83614055668642
ah what is that   111.14452598137727
it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence   109.4864626938906
at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move   92.82335224408864
you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name   161.7997491495406
what we are going to say does not concern your majesty   117.70722945997247
at your ball   108.25942560850277
it was here that the good old man whom you saved from death and dishonor threw himself into my arms   45.402373096365196
and you can not deny it   84.91368670708839
just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door   109.38737888634198
as to teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold   186.3187928107772
well asked the president what is your decision   101.50696169399295
are you a priest   90.30342216955478
exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbé busoni   155.38982288420587
disguised   86.34757013896774
you shall soon have something to drink   133.20011672913253
i have already told you it was impossible   123.31202201836216
he awaited mazarin s promised visit to get some light on his present situation   98.06323120413072
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds   57.62313056057624
at midnight my lord   151.89566462236291
here it is said he   25.6738761805304
but i thought you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival   104.49311139910152
i serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal   146.93727876573556
you have either been working for me or thinking of me   151.51329919549164
oh indeed indeed sir he is innocent   150.95748019375495
what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas   122.79914985906579
do not forget this evening do not forget that promise   155.40460231665188
he has informed me of the arrival of this ship   110.66745594601072
but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was non capisco   124.24582815635027
exactly so said the young men   80.88604788968752
inquired faria   80.20662211243567
de villefort was as usual unmoved   128.6508681735152
you knew it and said nothing   151.41341694905316
i will make him suffer   118.57147392640913
but she has not died of old age but of grief   98.00804199194754
is it from thee   131.7255993854872
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this   149.3005929165785
why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots   179.14850695949798
as for aramis he went off to the bishop s palace to see if he could possibly pass in with juxon to the king s presence   109.02687658448527
he was not insensible to such a proof of courage   102.1914560963034
no i have never injured her   52.814770485036874
and what did he say to you   175.6441136157407
the bandit s laws are positive   104.70296033236639
he is not at home and i will carry away the key after having placed you in his apartment   189.76437836198244
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants   171.66645326673665
athos reflected for an instant   90.14672759105343
what s the manner   171.41920891425224
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures   69.21297443087612
and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan   101.50616993070096
but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand   92.89159045678142
the unknown waited for silence and then resumed i told you well that she would know me   30.284034230941657
a dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in dismay   153.3861048120031
they knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit   106.01601197193968
he signified assent   170.87010297500285
and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon you   102.43045053549943
eight or ten days afterward aramis received the following letter my dear cousin here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of béthune the air of which you think is bad for her   106.20940343733281
you think of everything said d artagnan   132.92500880883802
i have told you that i am prepared for anything   168.16226818486538
cried the king in the highest state of choler   108.10964893954511
the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words   89.38600256106031
the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i can not comprehend   188.7091980193021
well what should i say to the king   40.43187190667311
are you for mazarin or for the princes   152.78310737907378
a murder   128.235586381388
and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning   51.68638603869665
his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear   77.48786601828718
providence appears to me to have no share in this affair   192.56299160772807
he stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired   183.29143535193774
said d artagnan to himself and darted into the passage   158.59558135461182
but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badly as witness chalais and mme   107.04550428414989
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the report   125.47307796601393
haydée answered with a heartrending expression why should he understand this my sister   144.93279508107693
athos assisted by porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top   163.63682656515323
at eccuis the same scene was repeated   97.12189376554888
they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit   143.42111972860775
in politics my dear fellow you know as well as i do there are no men but ideas no feelings but interests   120.9723757985452
where is your wife in the first place   79.32115515923545
why my companion   75.39983117128139
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it   36.78762849619763
the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst d artagnan was looking at bazin   130.95944476895124
good evening valentine said a well known voice   175.44472672841414
you ask that   42.95605589497548
danglars was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you care for his ill humor   186.04485638572078
d artagnan threw down a yet smoking pistol which he held in his hand and fell on his knees before his mistress   137.60419499194614
i swear to you monsieur commissary that you are in the profoundest error that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done   144.04794513774544
i once endeavored to go down with two of my servants   139.80381561619194
my mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom   162.70163560046853
as an italian he is superstitious   89.15534817872211
you formerly lived i believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth floor   131.1266795569177
how are they called who follow others in spite of them   127.03789843718079
it is ready in all ways   167.3395967282184
decidedly monsieur d artagnan you are the man i have been seeking   53.772801499597605
three compartments divided the coffer   132.51515245976572
they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses   126.14645293569987
exclaimed raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix spare him   154.41324887009858
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette   125.91972976957321
madame danglars uttered a scream and fainted   101.87453882943336
one of my friends one of my friends please to observe not myself said athos interrupting himself with a melancholy smile one of the counts of my province that is to say of berry noble as a dandolo or a montmorency at twenty five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen beautiful as fancy can paint   94.17744694339967
but i don t know him said the countess   154.95803007210964
in italy sinbad the sailor   64.97373909689601
no he muttered the doubt i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness   135.55718172557164
or mme   196.12906759196926
but why do you ask that   66.53953080429791
said andrea disappointed   65.58231252747314
i am indeed rejoiced said andrea   104.43166043330615
at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them   44.06164037697013
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet   206.14593097206958
the king went away enchanted   142.43312237422487
they are firing at the corpses replied athos   174.5420399082483
since she lodges with him   98.6718900003713
then whilst he fires make your horse rear   61.64890713122598
but i see you have other strings to your bow   131.44135088847503
ah sir replied caderousse we can not console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these   210.85569615254164
well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him   163.81031734309585
and you obeyed   141.4258819807359
said felton i doubted but now i believe   120.82168726954338
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres   34.84588549597018
and when you have found you will tell me will you not   188.74818271534588
de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event   105.87284761204792
run for help   124.99079931547398
well now she said let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you speak   179.52257329702783
whitehall   55.561415991631364
by the same sign which at the same time tells my right hand correspondent that i am ready while it gives notice to my left hand correspondent to prepare in his turn   156.96411840784162
d artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal   159.39064184705342
milady had likewise the best of passports her beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles   161.64622203776557
do you see this firman   135.13730373383396
if i give you time   96.6983512468898
well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy   149.8679858208875
which implies that we may die of hunger said aramis   167.83645386821087
i repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior man for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited that when i am with her she speaks of no one else   173.58832353053157
he was a foreigner   88.90473110680594
we were beginning to grow impatient said athos   141.04774639406747
musketeers   57.9180261473928
i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her   126.90073767514882
5 scott of course the son of an ill fated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death   164.25631305217252
i am sure you would not have forced me to come   158.80346986066922
this movement was observed by mordaunt   148.88351386114658
my dear friend we must take people as we find them   93.21038353707678
i know your prosperity is great you rascal   162.57510463639588
cried dantès his eyes sparkling with animation   115.63880534694248
it is a long time since we have had a battle eh porthos   87.31076437366401
the doctor pressed valentine s hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the steps   176.75437423846557
you have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder   96.82994702176617
felton obeyed   85.65192734996552
perhaps you did not know it   97.45795174412656
i pity her then   21.349415015338693
the park is twenty acres twenty comprising kitchen gardens and a common   58.096781682176555
but d artagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to kitty s door   107.63837143118063
penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his captain   41.187843468210076
i do not wish to cause you any remorse   124.86865253788528
exclaimed de winter seizing the arm of athos   117.99861968107771
the day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal   105.68778597948526
ah young man young man some flirtation or other   93.9992871007421
as to the servant she had run away at the moment of her master s arrest   101.16832508202019
milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup overflow   120.80761982522097
let us talk of your happy return my boy   79.45364867193592
will he be at home at eight o clock this evening   131.23864694450393
and your swords they saw the light of day i presume   191.14638963222677
have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused   187.13001914386643
i believe it   61.76438117728617
does she come to borrow money of me   58.10775344042018
and think that what you are about to do is for his sake   89.27537952309952
indeed i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of paris   84.9339050801997
another souvenir of monsieur mordaunt   124.19030402601395
well what is there surprising in that   176.39888667329365
go in whatever guise you choose   143.29264229606972
it seems that your memory is equally short in everything vampa said the count and that not only do you forget people s faces but also the conditions you make with them   120.31227421280667
it will only cost you a discount of 5 000 or 6 000 francs   118.52555509033343
luigi and teresa again set forward   145.15543969394906
because tomorrow haydée you will be free   154.21877179294682
the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven   101.80789358127512
tomorrow perhaps he may change you   132.28533124352543
felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from la rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase   99.86549832842104
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants   54.60868074539147
de jussac turned the corner of the convent   115.11338757637243
keep back my lord said d artagnan   68.83642169056645
who told you that i had been weeping   42.67895658570056
i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria   111.75929700318179
the morbleus the sang dieus the morts touts les diables crossed one another in the air   164.4855106266774
the position in which he had left him was critical   107.4383214571251
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo   84.90169690294081
i am d artagnan   62.97849960417183
ah stop   126.10902992790386
if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair   139.08439114286762
said eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other   126.87217508977157
athos was invited four times and each time took his friends and their lackeys with him   161.9430062334758
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect   94.86433943129747
but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop   87.34586830879465
d artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him   132.32597376482713
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman   165.04924156473277
you may perhaps have hidden a thought   187.30469291868476
the next morning therefore when broussel made his entrance into paris in a large carriage having his son louvieres at his side and friquet behind the vehicle the people threw themselves in his way and cries of long live broussel   137.72642218347139
you are sagacious   105.34046850142956
how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her   87.16260807583197
he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary   96.90584495525556
command me   110.6576642654749
three days afterward the four musketeers were in paris   206.74094420762077
alas my friends replied m   168.50977803636954
i have arranged two plans   153.603816383251
she was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressing gown   66.62117683538588
but my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the musketeer   100.39561492603953
this last apartment was a sort of dark room littered with papers   40.493924668770234
the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges   168.95159425813395
now said she listen to me   59.06589178511597
do not be alarmed maximilian   98.62607318063279
the minutes passed   136.1628445407152
but my wife wants a gold chain and i want a pair of silver buckles   115.77113344211418
not at all prince said monte cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have i done for you   133.4561085627123
ah said cavalcanti to himself if i only had that britzka those two good post horses and above all the passport that carries them on   118.20157062069231
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice   124.29910912860483
smugglers are not thieves   146.41954038160563
and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation   26.613739440337895
and athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene   91.89116145637686
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances   18.72335300984716
they ll be afraid and will disperse   82.2449200201911
i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed   183.37555614797165
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand   82.29949089699326
here it would be dangerous   253.19057651505668
in fact bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did   149.69625786500785
you are punctual thank you   127.89508986513272
monte cristo smiled with satisfaction   96.9263993404036
absolution   112.41408206985697
the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade   13.5873698663776
those barrels i saw through the door   113.0777797247568
d artagnan cast an inquiring glance at milady   83.37498483627009
in the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance an enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves   68.54605903445596
i can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison   17.892430858010286
this was in fact the worst complaint of louis xiii   120.57925022134076
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed d artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her   83.72670529334091
give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of the cavalcanti   152.06423042726763
morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted   115.54925469474495
that man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution   141.31600017381467
morbleu said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet   71.82420832155904
let me kill him   71.57719335867822
this was the chance at which m   138.09763128294006
i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment   103.81775404311452
when you travel it is to see everything   142.7726944740656
mistrust everything in short even your own shadow   99.77849681946735
he breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the eternal city ordered post horses at noon   122.36102645535696
the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes   121.3349464077375
madame de saint méran has arrived and her husband is dead   173.3375499362525
do not try my lord you can not guess who it is   106.87900503368658
so sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé who really was gentleness itself   49.831249585734426
what brother   97.48633383937579
there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets   147.8322352743515
d épinay can have displeased your father more than any other person   161.4277011433917
d artagnan gave the open letter to kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time   120.37553819102311
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa   117.96467381451933
and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption   105.67739457427119
president how entirely you have read my thoughts said benedetto in his softest voice and most polite manner   102.03191525863984
broussel s son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the king s officers   78.67658151259346
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still remain   124.29442858593748
well you see my dear d artagnan with what ill luck i play replied porthos with the most careless air in the world   103.08023175005587
and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter said debray   74.0778184209696
there always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before god   73.56138690934927
why just think for a moment   76.82628016945142
but i have striven to repress it   123.17537323136925
i wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so of which i stood absolutely in need on account of my accident   110.60035961421214
this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville s house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances   76.83906422555067
he cast his eyes again on the letter   65.3920416703995
albert said the journalist these are questions which it is difficult to answer   69.74879623448274
i should have thought that his duchess oh porthos s duchess is dressed by her husband s clerks said d artagnan laughing   149.14175715315514
a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the cave   161.39997770772013
besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome   130.34138822531912
and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls   86.46031866104235
upon my word monsieur said danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions   115.06136215312914
we very nearly succeeded in saving it   88.94215459987888
but this not being so easily plucked as the orange tree pricked him dreadfully   155.8364322044159
it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one   135.27489608862166
that s the advice i was about to give monsieur   67.56228376870554
this gascon is a precious fellow   93.32062373970125
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it although i have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand   84.94786414171641
he will allow you an income of 50 000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in paris   8.591689762782096
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill closed door and the door reopened   112.27435390308997
20185m gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable   204.9932339791718
if i am not saved i shall be avenged   114.46749497937894
does he hate his majesty as much as he does us   116.93584786642575
do not alarm yourself my dear maximilian they understand   144.41615632530966
you will find me ready to follow you   1.4514125094983115
besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that   59.351098964845136
but i am expecting some one a friend of athos   210.80392766569304
and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto ferrajo to the vessel   156.8450340605381
de saint méran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable   80.94609385052752
if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done   148.8813469664448
in fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help   122.46767617655551
this latter party was composed of ill looking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else   171.4957109505051
he still doubts thought milady   177.30314623899824
ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot   88.3183544131947
seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count   101.43994308501209
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man   158.12054154782572
i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman   114.56737954184916
said aramis in his tone of raillery   35.15488846646117
his warm and fickle imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed   154.47496885034525
if it s parry said the bishop i have nothing to fear   110.92360540785425
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly only they had agreed to meet once a week about one o clock at the residence of athos seeing that he in agreement with the vow he had formed did not pass over the threshold of his door   173.68449902954575
are you indisposed or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme   143.56463890210074
i have tony a safe if simple youth   130.6071533850204
milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it opened   78.30460713274493
tis then the devil that pursues   121.52658042896176
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction   69.18289690746737
but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dantès father   40.048906808692564
he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune   212.12270309592589
she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for him   55.87726453582565
my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m   118.11455360532005
the sea smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element   168.95073920899847
ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us   138.91059897264978
beauchamp announced the servant   119.28221146092655
athos had even gone so far as to question m   63.0238416033331
indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror   79.65569758612159
albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner   70.67026889507056
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his father s abode   152.7280232351037
it was morrel s turn to become pale   193.51383223091602
de tréville who had been accustomed to associate together   220.6806968160225
you would hold me in horror go on   123.40577627058528
in the meantime said tréville seek him not if i have a right to advise you   164.24114169117973
it is as yet unknown to all and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian   124.34087558410474
de boville s study   111.00555676343446
a slight color mounted to his cheeks   137.99664606052366
gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won   83.50742975173118
i am rich   91.16822446423065
well leave them with your porter   76.39653641130985
how has this terrible past been recalled   76.30888157687984
morcerf asked leave to retire   95.29100605109093
you who are in power have only the means that money produces we who are in expectation have those which devotion prompts   195.55761031395372
they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europe the english the spanish and the german   160.89511907697104
but be of good courage my lad   107.31062752125919
listen milady said the cardinal the affair is important   108.15625955337597
you are an amiable and charming young man said mme   122.52713469066481
you love my mistress then very dearly monsieur chevalier   120.92074090965049
his really sincere royalism made him youthful again   95.35405693926195
shall you see the king again   176.66929677076536
whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldn t share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain   78.36476100982404
my god that s all   141.84782376348244
they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic   56.15396894984219
i think i have discovered my father   94.3420091770951
well my good friend returned the abbé in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please   74.83989227007393
that is to say yes and no   182.58743844437134
do as i bid you show the chevalier out   127.25649825806808
you are quite right beauchamp observed the young aristocrat   135.89361591072063
be prudent athos said aramis   125.08280834789544
that same evening upon reaching his abode in the champs élysées the count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner   81.0789347139731
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness   169.37421498264544
i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired   75.8379389866485
and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with athos certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble a knight of the order of the king was his ancestor   166.7181756206728
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop   80.62665159482906
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends   157.0976368092958
there it is   127.36141922087202
and those of the first floor   117.4316394411644
thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him   162.86256252129104
planchet waited towel on arm   48.477207158921175
mademoiselle de villefort is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young lady   55.7017526004058
because i judge it from the past   108.83757153908803
the count will come of that you may be satisfied   85.10049130524948
the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbé who lives next door to you   182.91907755866214
villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars   187.17419380936343
then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position   61.27881482232456
oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn   78.99867788943016
pray come to my aid madame   155.11520704327012
he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with   103.97444350997522
another time at my own house in the country in my château at when i had a château   111.48976396318243
age produces good sense and as i doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation i want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to mine   100.50296329248366
to leave you   155.04327259460027
what i hate to day i adore to morrow and vice versa   156.0228144537785
might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete   103.78184041745976
with this key i open the abyss   129.12179903323445
but remarked madame de villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident   60.07496880464767
the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally short   126.51225775590467
yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé s gaze   119.36917122886241
but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist   135.18614150146797
he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees   131.71225038802876
noirtier again closed his eyes   132.12804762703556
in that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in france at the convent of the carmelites at béthune   185.98484101583483
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased   190.82068647856914
since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me   130.76624863386238
child   165.4131959966322
madame said d artagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him   193.35822518880872
because these prisoners sir are at my disposal and i choose to dispose of them as i like   141.14417241934456
each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold   103.45030808728775
d artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses   157.8166097232052
the secret cave chapter 25   156.73917491333393
at his announcement d artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his bones   140.75037822728717
my dear bazin said d artagnan i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church   128.2365271879809
he was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face   117.05594081424478
spain is her country replied d artagnan   118.78732044004174
myself excepted and again mazarin smiled   83.28087738790268
i only drank a glass of my master s lemonade that s all   118.60072162065919
then turning towards ali he said let all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady that she may select those she prefers for her carriage   136.0051074955197
then you must die replied the president calmly   119.75078430404531
very well said d artagnan i shall discover them   94.14318429653164
consider maillard said the curate that i have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that i have made myself responsible for you   153.6941812977078
to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellow a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer   64.82807918077066
you have my promise he said after a minute s pause extending his hand to monte cristo   156.20652197246454
merely the 5 000 000 you have about you   99.36718094002104
said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred   183.57478734118456
the only question was had she ten or twelve   127.6713162992258
in another week you will have left beaucaire remarked caderousse for the fair ends in a few days   36.23053424442759
if i may ask without indiscretion   109.47396739406007
oh the deuce   29.92816182314921
and touching his horse with the spur he cantered back to paris   148.97028983320936
i shall be sure to find employment   149.8303406400068
penelon nearly swallowed his quid   172.17973416520223
if a king he lost   31.543690455335494
signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped off   79.24987529186166
at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow   128.40450168449493
asked d artagnan eagerly   62.75561001348281
it must be the son of mère simon who has stolen them   79.00159435186913
both entered and found themselves in darkness   88.77954620005936
but not for you my dear viscount who are one of my most intimate friends and on whose silence i feel i may rely if i consider it necessary to enjoin it may i not do so   74.91618096465808
it is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery   141.62163307280554
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess   83.1756450759102
you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio   154.7823756419808
my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousqueton it is a vulgar pleasure but i shoot sometimes   65.48878244969055
oh the scoundrels   115.87815192141765
that voice also was known to grimaud   75.9775905874541
the cardinal   98.56415149510661
said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host   59.4059962523915
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments   130.28309604497755
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly   100.0953596951194
so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking d artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made a sign to guitant to follow him   127.89950916239734
what have i to do with politics   97.29416933534489
grimaud shook his head negatively   154.47943474860853
why you said answered mademoiselle danglars that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals   68.52485974007818
that did not come from a man without a heart   122.6128788438836
all at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone   47.06257493492615
the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo   102.1088877270749
a moment after those who surprised by this tumult had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it saw the door open and four men clothed in black not come out of it but fly like so many frightened crows leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture feathers from their wings   158.9582795670193
said d artagnan aloud   115.43546601010584
it is certainly the king said the man rising again   142.00264738648372
but athos raised his hand   123.4949610796581
as to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail   136.73598055250187
courage take courage my dear mother   134.66729414522905
the tie is even more direct it seems to me   17.313319462770977
come this way   199.60665513032993
the history of haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave   138.18730573621787
the sergeant saw that d artagnan was in earnest   39.309969341830794
but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women   32.61487023868881
leaving the church a woman and a young girl dressed in black the one as a widow and the other as an orphan have re entered their cell   193.96914950123573
if however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill   200.46216714562993
but though he held the cardinal s promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos   98.95165774806829
monsieur your friend pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears but we do not know that name monsieur your friend having disabled two men with his pistols retreated fighting with his sword with which he disabled one of my men and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it   108.1539003646088
you look careworn   93.87622768360089
finish the bottle and you will be completely so   132.0261793782302
he serves under monsieur dessessart   176.41694613733236
as soon as the siege is over we ll carry her off from that convent   136.2801443712632
and although her underlip like that of all princes of the house of austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt   150.30483014629377
i never meddle in intrigues and if i occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others i am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them secret   162.5881220966738
this mass of rock like the giant adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow   167.44237988457377
thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known mousqueton well   80.34573763599488
for their ears closely applied to the door did not lose a syllable of what he said while their mouths repeated as he went on the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in the antechamber   102.27010876529708
of monsieur de bouillon   157.62907426664424
every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other   89.28305577141097
felton was hers   141.7919390506365
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals   128.04316971102898
i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence   78.65249884171234
what to do with him   37.530709406425046
d artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen   172.23138826411548
we will try   82.7458476289857
give your orders and we will execute them   64.14572006303658
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you   91.81118136455801
guilty   122.4527656974342
what he   105.69185777928854
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers   23.439545520821
i never had a vocation for the bands   80.98065886741757
my funds are deposited there and you can understand that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor   55.10709841796229
cried mordaunt come to me   82.40804502848698
muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more   114.18093693696989
ah truly   63.129110104997835
no i confess it   104.03478390657905
and taking up grimaud and blaisois they went on foot to the rue guenegaud   85.80796991991659
in this room at about ten o clock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound   101.74791807562171
the cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for anything in future   117.29345419077944
do you still wish to dispose of all   88.05815817857928
morrel rose and advanced to the door   122.34193939568799
chapter 97   131.1476272933496
paradise is at noisy le sec upon the site of the archbishop s chateau   219.68595230543824
in order to meet the payments then due   190.7467845492136
are they spanish haitian or neapolitan bonds   150.90300533624497
yes gentlemen said d artagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect i fancy he is anxious still to do   201.9933285316668
bonacieux was going   93.52196930950538
let him enter cried d artagnan   63.70862761695222
d artagnan went up to him   161.53582669357795
what will you do in a foreign land an enemy s country   208.9146941519739
does he wish to be a bishop   133.13345985562398
i think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that direction   116.77505926874254
bertuccio sighed and went on first   70.09729934073202
but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually   64.24091070649342
it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said beauchamp   153.13932493124844
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and i know you well   102.31882791382262
oh nothing but a scratch said d artagnan   139.9459915543124
i had much rather you were french and myself also   63.59622097356473
yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves   173.43634309433173
as for d artagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him   178.8842828003213
you mean to say then my dear monsieur la ramee that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird i will continue answerable for him   75.59731235812032
but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of château renaud   67.42104408737481
at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity   103.92633449247927
here said the prince handing him a purse here is for rocroy   146.5434042540464
he was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the count s carriage stopped at the gate   89.08094162694684
it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight   132.57080312540765
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe   138.1943802161623
the messenger did not say   142.9193854460791
at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic   106.00008792014734
why i paid him   153.4134134776308
the night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven o clock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission   133.02676282965226
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest   174.3777000159826
to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains walls hung with velvet drapery and the soft perfume of burning wood the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream   153.2950388081232
such as you see me i am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur appert and the man in the little blue cloak   90.80405724888874
she questioned emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew   125.64208258170318
yes that is a great word sir   69.94790319602629
a gleam of light shone in aramis s eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by d artagnan   110.11982970758298
albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the paper   181.25478825362524
it would be no doubt parbleu if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower   146.31337421295055
yes said danglars   119.16793081106954
well comte i am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the prince de marsillac who is happily in paris just now   48.243599973979556
there s the landlord of the lamb and gros louis the farmer   103.80354748609531
i have never understood how i could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so pale   101.60028494586538
monsieur maillard himself   83.78536147147362
hallo catalan   148.4036783755494
he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle   190.29198228459427
but instead of obeying him the servants stood watching m   108.90465110551034
and have you never revisited that village   30.663404508877136
things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies   81.81451964275627
eh eh eh   155.40299709528492
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon   64.20808782706938
it is a fine thing to have such credit   75.91420835886206
because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake   101.51561831193918
de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on parade he stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday evening do you know gentlemen   115.5070879532745
the officer desired to have milady s packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the boat   154.25255843687472
and madness   62.228196000720004
and madame de villefort charming people m   103.7477396036914
a moment later the gray headed man was beside him   111.89714235390046
yes i shall pay if as i hope my vessel arrives safely   69.30659172074996
he had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him   36.009022844680146
it does not concern me you are right   50.42968519587535
for example an english prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of malmsey   86.56501262688955
you encourage me said athos i will continue then   126.27356012836451
i expected this said felton   153.30618830718575
cried the king what can i say to you   157.73396964255178
will you be so good   190.67206974726182
30339m the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamore tree in the centre of the clump   115.71900945843802
are you sure of that   149.2376623471132
the house is sold then   158.39337516479202
what a confounded country this england is   178.9104821548287
athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to lord de winter and the wedding ring which charles i   143.29102796016866
it was mme   22.60506621392419
besides what is there astonishing when you think of the grief i ought to be in that i shut myself up   22.272327908732237
replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage   38.02762987620288
athos and aramis took their leave but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the duke s cries   73.85475434330425
whose then   142.28426237109588
here then is a puzzle for the learned observed d artagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise   146.8719731792377
madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop   95.73445934042509
he was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop   146.3652860782257
now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony   99.7684853945748
20147m why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form   71.06318144602994
bertuccio slightly started   128.88006369596744
you are coming to sup with me are you not   102.37713506520794
follow me   115.04786017137856
incessantly alas   70.33586475697211
alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again   105.67685758320314
towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened   117.92153528068748
where is she   137.68630078097064
somebody replied that he was mistaken and went away   95.29325561159729
what music   96.47831833790579
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle   165.9403737210315
andrea s hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time   82.63809946832383
look at me said monte cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive look at me   122.48918829736922
but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company   137.9690008151562
de villefort bear it   41.45451335225289
and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m   153.95503707571143
that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him   42.45322481732239
these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which m   95.30034375036843
the invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until to morrow morning   149.15757820588075
for master broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people   139.56888004163363
the room of the retired baker the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance m   103.38517923867653
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar   107.69069376215711
you are determined to leave the chateau   123.66158113200477
the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls   182.1583467362022
you are mistaken my friend replied the abbé   122.50548627215439
he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier   79.11731576629299
suddenly he heard a cry it was his daughter s voice   170.26381524219042
we are not of the same religion   13.392450364341954
for example here is debray who reads and beauchamp who prints every day a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard   117.68181694575657
and planchet with aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by d artagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream   75.5354956267897
you well know that our interests are the same   170.19986003917649
then bending as if she would have knelt and joining her hands she said with an accent of despair edmond you will not kill my son   93.95443932334578
allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders   94.70893255855869
for at that time villars cotterets was a royal residence   112.8645607514472
the clock striking eight awoke her   96.59633305530873
what what   57.476978224116884
the cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little   200.138461284117
they ll kill poor porthos when he comes up said aramis   112.68487227594578
one was a young man of three or four and twenty who was in love with m   147.6643768557526
then he thought he was going to die   124.36241968574626
said d artagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing   16.108463827407007
i want air that is all   76.82011593262271
monsieur said aramis parodying jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves   93.87293802852423
said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out   124.9236537572512
in stuart s room   137.0232599894978
but do not be alarmed on her account   43.551807600714994
when you speak i seem to have to do with a madman   103.27597146526247
to conspire no doubt with your enemies the huguenots and the spaniards   29.394161196457418
it was her first and on what an occasion   112.49449745736565
i think so indeed   90.3793256223655
but if i am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint   163.01013412398012
the next morning at nine o clock he entered franz s room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm   70.49518941639315
asked he although he knew it perfectly   100.50436267740702
then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt   91.15329056078033
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to say valentine has been assassinated   81.56794255401097
and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen   124.36609781527265
boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for la ramee   46.98013840993198
and whenever we find each other in whatever place it may be said kitty you will find me loving you as i love you today   173.6009938677679
tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily   115.98661923440578
i can sir said haydée drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed   68.25539652231765
there was a moment s silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation   121.06496318726714
i don t understand you bazin   147.79113990940397
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him   64.07249000656077
then you must know what her name was as a young girl   137.58022874883648
the second at the mansion of madame de chevreuse   53.52982991972029
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay   154.21255010697013
the red duke is capital   160.55672705969596
albert led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite apartment   182.5086109311055
you know how much the queen loves dancing   111.54132992600601
continued the false abbé   20.092218619956526
yes madame chatillon stammered out   122.36595089126132
do you think to reassure me when you say that maximilian   107.71268548316199
he then asked with whom he played   63.14493624649809
but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed   130.5572817400895
but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends   137.45537019402514
it is not only a valuable diamond but it is an enchanted talisman   158.7279716752502
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head   90.34158632701866
athos s eyes shone with joy   110.69715453091834
that may be said the count turning pale   148.88163366543668
and this d artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle   95.80385142307452
de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air   107.98675633514738
at the end of that time i shall come and say to you the assertion is false and i retract it or the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please   94.75070175967184
d artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach   74.22396400459311
thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the lord   150.88401416104756
grief has stunned him replied d avrigny   77.62450017056543
the order is positive   139.2229484088895
all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned   71.63127376027003
do not let us do things in a hurry   149.73026223109804
my strength is failing me   77.82108802272307
enough of this said cavalcanti   84.96875198097442
all my researches have been useless   82.20997130394503
our good d artagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye   90.19442600584406
cavalcanti to him   50.47955522423723
give a ball   114.74283748616193
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him   158.45367183492246
why do you stop here   78.44781849729122
the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew in full costume and cæsar borgia paying him most marked attentions   186.6271873779327
if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied athos   234.65862659129624
well said the marquise it seems probable that by the aid of the holy alliance we shall be rid of napoleon   115.59553922947232
why didn t thou do as thou didst to the first man   165.24375692329994
the king made his entrance into paris on the twenty third of december of the same year   50.31131361113805
dantès took the hand of the abbé in his and affectionately pressed it   105.15687750055841
i have not time for anybody s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests   145.96597023251104
he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf   156.34646701863053
should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart   95.63266850820952
in a quarter of an hour we set off   127.19887585854528
you bid me adieu   119.74335206974997
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box   111.35727028156225
monseigneur said marshal de grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son count de guiche and his traveling companion viscount de bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him   106.31928699814259
it was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the english for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody else   148.61682077485438
de tréville was the father of his soldiers   95.89044894196566
your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence   121.99409395925578
but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell   31.52723382027787
he always did so at caderousse s ideas   116.31245116021138
this woman has come back again into england for the purpose of conspiring against my life   141.23182040585795
but it is well known what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers   201.98562110774958
i live alone   170.43483919955997

monte cristo was more affectionate than ever indeed his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all   84.75615182033367
he then entered the room   141.48595922329932
but his temper cooled down like his friend s   58.57237166391938
he again fainted   54.2380487796333
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking   87.88263733004575

for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared   126.66251528889228
said caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger   200.92605743393045
when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved   73.60190154240362

the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion   137.5685832694515
but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian   143.77834651705544
three quarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him   187.15305383595674
exclaimed the latter the cardinal   119.0508071594483

dantès said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die   208.66516938743055
then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him   138.51845870206324
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided   93.73186973997022

he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible   130.61094876805046

and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly 300 000 francs and have those 300 000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again   102.30039944925255
well mother i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis 25 added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self abasement   115.09402200053147

sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause   104.65898491135884
they were indeed admirably received by mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely d artagnan his captaincy porthos his barony   90.05770432729372

what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort   180.30101599944794
d artagnan took the soldier s arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword   162.65226198442718

nay answered the countess i know no more of him than yourself   150.86897709717542
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent   61.33365428552314

aramis rushed to the hotel de ville where madame de longueville was sojourning   108.9745436449196
and yet as he journeyed along a profound sadness weighed upon his heart   104.02758083758076
athos raised his sword   157.69840513526952
why you poor short sighted simpleton can you not guess who this noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed   132.69600039143677
many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and m   122.34187777102515
at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed   148.37871349650135
but the first lines aroused his attention   80.55533769712363
oh tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail   72.20158446308506
a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor   118.47595036648764
and at these words the musketeer in irreproachable costume belted as usual with a tolerably firm step entered the cabinet   44.10249076526519
four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that i have earned and i ought to take ten to the owner   180.26655888398153
but you can not break it off in this way   28.690886512324397
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel d artagnan began to recover himself little by little   91.60810419947862
it is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full application   69.22938364023227
and still she doubted the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death   124.3965103594364
for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths   139.17160537836463
and where is this man   102.88034100250678
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned   133.53795155811545
baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after him   88.22427878665664
and d artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant   120.83919690269899
like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company   81.8104645675927
de château renaud   135.66566306081452
i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow   115.05280161269896
that is exactly what i want   134.36435797311105
let me see   125.6187147224971
the king then was condemned in advance   182.05317907929452
the other drank it only by accident and although barrois is dead it was noirtier whose death was wished for   93.16674742267372
valentine raised her head struck dumb with astonishment   9.339298892349987
juxon   96.32813552002608
i shall try in the latter case alas   72.2521344465801
you will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used   100.40839838735414
your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m   148.938431729465
raoul had been there about ten minutes during five of which he was lost in reverie when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face who with a napkin around his body another under his arm and a white cap upon his head approached him holding paper pen and ink in hand   133.70118204199716
that s the thing   77.94762939559126
descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance   179.99922587345446
faith my lord but indifferently   74.98676854832516
ah yes said château renaud   102.12679520677092
not more than eight or ten feet   134.32178422513863
replied mazarin so you have no money   16.90585876524173
de chavigny who according to report was a son of richelieu s and had been a creature of the late cardinal s understood tyranny   92.00457343828276
speak italian sir   62.87024544676271
well it is true   96.12626903761277
there are moments when a man grows young again in his children   105.08910372843039
on the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every kind of civility thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own   121.19665497046567
all gascon as he was d artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood   50.946696721359814
oh what is the matter   78.68423877277448
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money   30.035346297724928
i can not believe such was the case   106.41270700985231
what does monsieur know this horse   106.78981401805245
one of them was made of debray château renaud and beauchamp   132.13022963789365
and bentivoglio who were poisoned   108.38106011541753
on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows   64.81352100392567
then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed   119.29424749455006
have you not said that that abduction was entirely political   115.30764057460524
yes your eminence it is the same   174.50221733920884
but by the holy name of the virgin i swear that no one is more devoted to your majesty than i am   81.09712574243639
then all three windows will have yellow draperies   121.01257732962475
well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be possible   195.04133657387345
monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting   172.7393700847182
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head   3.583613352389392
he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the lorraine party as well as from the spaniards upon the arches of notre dame   54.534192889826905
indeed i should expect misfortunes   79.61929982270243
where is their road   126.9570325555027
a bad plan   97.68046362550477
there s nothing to do in paris now there s no fronde   162.63222759146987
no maximilian it is not suitors to which madame de villefort objects it is marriage itself   43.949853593897814
and then accompanying the glance with explanatory words that is but too just said she tenderly   137.88259752983114
ah that would indeed be infamous   103.58052059450105
but this is tyranny   76.37178908838918
oh that is very easily arranged   97.43217331275054
yes go go   178.50672659976107
but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it   49.07665972672706
tréville understood admirably the war method of that period in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy must live at the expense of his compatriots   26.365832562545776
if you wish i will inquire   70.31826820001558
even an executioner is not exempted   153.55219198009996
well sir said morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and i have nothing further to tell you   120.31764987399241
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied d artagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia   186.65483538329
monsieur de richelieu would have said five hundred crowns for the councillor   128.84473241152247
oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over again   109.85121165976723
they jumped into the ditch and prepared to scale the breach   107.88673632780495
though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country   111.47776660045879
i feel quite sure of it now   130.13283337763608
hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke i fancied you had about twenty men with you so i came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause   136.52492807204453
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent   142.3880771719162
they had been ushered into madame de villefort s room who had said she would receive them there   100.75723886640176
in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that door a man wrapped in a cloak   161.07821669730103
the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered andrea in a posture of entreaty   191.30897611987638
bonacieux in the convent of the carmelites at béthune the trial in the isolated house and the execution on the banks of the lys   175.61770260177698
she has sprained her foot you know   42.122361834494185
de villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour   140.35592234976986
may i give you a friendly counsel   148.99198475490255
when the gentleman who came three months ago the agent of thomson french arrives announce his arrival to me   93.50534866160052
your son shall be happy mercédès repeated the count   182.86675720002384
my dear sir said château renaud allow me to tell you that you do not understand that manœuvre with the eye glass half so well as debray   168.0529458860532
one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu   88.54106267882477
well are you coming   67.53894577118677
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger   108.76649879339651
down with the officer   152.91220800491033
how inscrutable are the ways of providence for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased   162.48806022424708
well would you believe it   139.78691247726724
at this appeal d artagnan drew kitty quietly away and slipped into the chamber   105.47484319284182
and what can we do there   12.634733461927155
still the idea of seeing our dear valentine again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave   98.10916936073262
let us hasten up   87.42342681218824
am i or am i not the queen   72.87124252576918
had not villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter the only proof against him   157.60643886857932
mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters   135.89573146337904
and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it   160.2029439993414
fernand would have been court martialed if napoleon had remained on the throne but his action was rewarded by the bourbons   92.04735744953784
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended   61.665383171714296
albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz d épinay to pass a fortnight at venice   130.6195020299624
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston   98.17927059172008
be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you   35.86160073712638
did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saint méran has fallen a victim   51.18048843745265
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove   164.08834592135298
it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life   109.04318987025965
well you can throw out the draft   120.71204051667026
so you renounce the world then forever   63.47044608116144
was grimaud s laconic reply   104.2620244521253
the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtier s lips seemed to start from his eyes   117.18213934629345
no sir he died of brain fever in dreadful agony   113.97101196480531
they would have an easy bargain of four isolated men   166.6461676513021
oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet   141.17975798917428
but for the moment let us separate   136.70754420386683
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry   70.1681422544201
well now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame bonacieux   115.06119174451388
but the reverse is the case   136.32628863055444
the door is locked   112.28756409008611
cried all the brigands when they saw the chief   145.47433335065614
a priest can understand a father s grief   55.168431198585964
the pickaxe descended or rather fell   160.7794793550263
well i will do better mercédès   161.5863770007727
you have continued your course of villany   84.3201265158404
without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can said porthos   95.65385921569822
milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation   148.52614468300243
i am sick of it my mind preys on itself   123.28381431930633
ah you see well what does that prove   107.91844722007647
you are at your journey s end   201.4571327092604
commissary   93.80675274812751
well said felton only promise till you have seen me again   96.08302731533676
if i were but learned in theology i should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits when we were at crevecoeur   161.44608096391084
said others   175.49231369989528
monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said d artagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions   125.99869902618451
the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news   109.34556654627704
and drew upon us a patrol of archers   123.91050946209863
said athos do you regret you have not shed our blood   43.85273344892893
determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room   71.72795706228212
it was because you loved me was it not count   146.55836693626173
a vast crowd filled the apartments of saint germain   97.68280070920409
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir   92.08170474423487
noirtier even she would have been constrained to pity him   75.31503017376627
these were his own words of that i am certain   96.699853378879
certainly continued danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned   149.49711627987233
he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders   92.65351916181643
replied d artagnan why don t you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch   83.13998623616396
when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you   40.8534790917963
antoinette is very well he said and madeleine tolerably so   92.46726482897358
you accept my proposal   63.61541184521917
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence   127.1354053168641
at the other end of the town   185.01337738916436
he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to planchet   161.33279411292185
unfortunately the general s valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number   14.328768675460253
i shall be at your orders said monte cristo bowing   238.33217815361866
i am a frondist from my heart   116.41475860785516
hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly d artagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank   32.581517675292275
at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercédès   133.13644616487733
is the young guardsman at home   113.49697156287569
the parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers   99.72281061735286
only unfortunately i did not curve aright   174.30810452603674
but he one day opened it before porthos and porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and papers love letters and family papers no doubt   183.64198772482388
you were not expected   201.18389776984495
i thank you d artagnan   70.6009767575905
confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage   114.40761199767648
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp   136.80337282258387
and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society   95.46233438734976
d artagnan the elder an honor to which remember your ancient nobility gives you the right sustain worthily your name of gentleman which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you   94.04664984582618
0341m i understand you allowed matters to take their course that was all   127.8202186801782
we might say that was his dream   204.75932257600462
you know madame how suddenly i snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched   134.9440724583117
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman   55.05017367387838
dantès went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever   104.7959252128991
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out   109.18863167484838
has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands   106.29992163673634
i shall kneel down to pray   92.86575744404237
after having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his souvenirs auteuil rue de la fontaine no   102.903083984873
all right all right said the jailer   140.8519138507271
one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is a knight of malta as timid as a young girl   165.05824564663328
my friend said he one never has too much money   82.2532915300641
villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman   134.2516058268764
we have lost a year to no purpose   91.06786512030561
do you think they have recognized us   104.50979673576995
said mazarin breathing more freely   127.15881937838725
which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen   134.7363688246885
danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so   123.81429052367345
nevertheless monsieur de tréville s company of musketeers alone can not maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will   100.346555568855
if not before louvres thirty   133.81784423560148
he is now in his fifth year of captivity   111.96480794521307
said château renaud i would rather end my career like m   66.63226945943056
the three presents of d artagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april 1625 the market town of meung in which the author of romance of the rose was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it   114.69226725034048
ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me   54.09593836129514
and in the evening i took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where i had concealed my treasure   85.70942179028549
oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together   164.85127385039027
caderousse s hands still grasped the gold and bank notes and la carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest   54.081136492273586
we have made our calculations with spartan economy and we each require fifteen hundred livres   145.04869498871764
the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground   105.14086572445379
morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice   177.09824471981227
did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting   155.6558675837895
you noticed that i didn t breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit   125.9417894377528
impossibility   153.52384045066464
the festa was magnificent   86.82131670204589
exclaimed julie   102.15636843514531
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward   100.93445700675235
i think he is about to leave paris   133.61094991381486
on the first story do you see there is the anteroom and the drawing room   77.15618300959424
but exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there yourself   167.30338638024733
i m hit in the other side   88.33596909613834
is it not true aramis   38.48698750177326
you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest   132.853525732429
i thought i had not heard aright   146.88586135188953
everyone expected an explosion on carlini s part   157.35434817554318
bonacieux throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands   157.58297611413897
well then said d artagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it   154.83605612853768
the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surgères to mauzes   160.54185621252458
and why in this solemn drawing room when the study is so comfortable   161.28840089859085
it is the devil in person   65.30086241076654
the breakfast hour arrived but m   23.385910570902425
friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that   20.23452129507875
thanks monsieur said monte cristo   138.03135360837456
i pretended to pour out water from the jug but i only drank that which i had saved in my glass   185.82263374004916
here are the august signatures of your majesty s hand   145.5767887375816
years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present   110.28268458493531
i only await one thing before following your advice   83.56131631345642
the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey   111.18183964833675
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct   123.68898163978183
then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me   121.90019965751932
and it was no bad one i believe since here we are   103.06798753819591
well then   93.11842522959711
but you   124.32990593435963
i sometimes dream that s all   63.76449822660333
ah the young rascal stealing in a garden he does not know where that may lead him to   157.120805067461
danglars any reason   64.38180118938388
oh come gentlemen my master is ill   111.8397529287235
i hope at least that you may be mistaken   147.137102593945
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and i can not fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you   98.36185744706201
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the musketeer drew back with signs of terror and refused   215.28323691196107
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eels all light wholesome food suitable for the sick   134.1152043596767
at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight   91.99572562300465
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine   110.98464907516735
scarcely had i finished my repast when i felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor   169.56768454265546
then you don t believe me   99.40598398740201
then you accept his offer   73.11637702692235
it was nearly eight o clock when they set out again   145.51945282855624
lions of roman crowns and which he   72.45440151198642
but d artagnan confined himself to telling them that m   179.19919075772174
added d artagnan   147.95060369001078
i am for you not only a protector but a friend   222.47035887209103
the part she plays pardieu   72.36680345942287
anne blushed and buried her face in her hands   99.79682781106438
the coachman as we can well understand made no resistance   66.05370224897896
the pavilion at nine o clock d artagnan was at the hôtel des gardes   104.56176057985678
i was mistaken said the host he s not quite dumb   200.2213447604699
jacques de la boucherie   102.10702288338734
good thought d artagnan   148.62161838739775
we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk   230.18853109527686
chastised monsieur   104.23344787327564
his companions followed his example   101.5586525285727
was an accomplice of the duke s and escaped along with him   139.85210772071744
the officer obeyed   141.41173382826582
alas to many the path is traced by tears   31.983780721612632
noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties   82.28539599874009
it became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of calvinism a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling   77.2399047897424
when landing at portsmouth milady was an englishwoman whom the persecutions of the french drove from la rochelle   128.11448924470102
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort s for the purpose of returning the procureur s visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion   132.02777816193864
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you   102.81527508883813
no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue d enfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession i rang the bell and fled with all speed   157.2830276243019
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so   106.39178084415661
oh what a magnificent jewel   146.9094046681439
when you have finished your story god and i will judge   98.89514882703088
milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees   201.36809765640427
albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that madame danglars blushed   110.20385604400143
but then he breakfasted with me indeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion   109.33177503556884
i play with monsieur du vallon every night   142.47573682843844
they are names of shepherds   65.73493309926364
the next morning he could not see or hear   52.24906434449881
de saint méran s oldest friends and chamberlain to the comte d artois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence   120.23380740488815
and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows   55.044717586848016
intact my dear friend   89.20579179946354
d artagnan was known to this valet de chambre who was no other than bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal   153.82942130912636
i am a gentleman born and my blood is warm as you may have remarked my dear d artagnan   113.4987042113349
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker s family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars   235.86143062347452
dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god   112.55770275031429
who would have come to the assistance of two strangers two unknown persons   154.81079752296063
and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer   108.38812450508085
now when i am an abbé i say as few masses as i can   198.9823490004986
dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday   158.44362850800312
albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard   103.49625147872214
i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman   142.7460245660087
without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with   12.305949229048565
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me   57.31935960533109
but sir he has fled   148.40098135476777
that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them   112.42252141866871
scarron turned his chair toward the door raoul blushed athos made a sign to aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window   70.10097449753519
well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks   122.80049549434375
sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure   121.09867092580464
for what reason   61.14978858187156
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission athos for generosity is a hero of romance   96.14615837789466
what troubles me is the idea of defeat   168.1620203121707
he told me to watch you   149.87733827226046
go on go on   94.26792434391456
mazarin rose   90.23906190095045
and now madame till i see you again   112.79110917907668
i am sure that whatever you do is well done   94.22649139189483
the queen shook her head despairingly   106.38790585592731
come count said raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the augustine   60.9908946634526
fortunately he recovered   197.17438754359372
now said d artagnan you wouldn t be sorry to understand the plot would you porthos   108.28499497158869
therefore my dear mr   129.8847984256624
the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure   137.61923692049788
if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble   181.7406703176709
remember my words if you return home safely i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you also   59.959725983960816
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride   35.57969499611809
but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment   120.63933329561245
i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied monte cristo amid the general outburst of amazement   100.06228793859198
and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition were now explained   62.12338880598356
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand   151.05812263845237
take this pen and paper and write what i dictate   70.53343747308494
that name written in her hand   21.741004583467898
sire sire murmured the minister for pity s approach m   65.2779200846111
it happened that on this particular night the minister s box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question   142.23834253091505
it appears so sir replied monte cristo   178.63530193673
this woman entered and approaching milady s bed offered her services   116.47369541542507
0141m so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man   134.22891960344958
on arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital   96.04929521745551
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way   162.61159121283566
i think she wants to ride on horseback   93.75777237069786
it is no business of mine   149.08918040577265
during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind   111.06884873616384
mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit   65.80572852543548
well said interrupted château renaud   127.32231091046592
to be sure i do furiously   110.93581700614573
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room   146.82585525298472
what shall i promise   94.92305821158145
yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment   105.8208727594139
they were in the majority   77.18844883028927
my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source   66.42241235442523
and what was the end of this worthy man   132.9843837507812
if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question i believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty   110.99012386893749
that is true monsieur replied d artagnan and whether drawn by myself or another i assure you i shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman   180.3985614499415
i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me   164.77012757089852
meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself   102.82738351333046
you sent for me   166.80956049902846
meantime the young woman continued to advance counting the houses and windows   123.89653471621837
you raised the whole district so they told me   96.41038694302975
follow him said villefort to dantès   210.55116960734614
scarcely ever   158.10303093315747
what is to happen   154.5044601139158
i can not tell you monsieur   109.29625879832663
she was charming   139.0441284997021
do i speculate   105.2227806083059
though the lord owes them this miracle in recompense for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your father   96.25744574435464
he sent for me answered the mercer proudly   52.64784549066376
he shall die   112.8770477647555
my dear dantès said he swear to perform what i am going to tell you for it is a matter of the deepest importance   104.46416296480821
dandré himself   177.73674615255837
and can you find him   123.84143718426478
these things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly   97.6072692201277
must you know all   120.92670331977257
by my father s tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl i swear to you haydée that if any misfortune happens it will not be to me   131.74048336847048
de saint méran madame de saint méran barrois all fall   119.28564156032213
bonacieux was   77.2035457341515
at the rospoli palace   45.344575014497806
is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago   136.7339233771827
de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth bettor   129.44655919970035
what say you   127.92403905441122
no one at villefort s doubted that a duel would ensue from it   192.774691933984
get on it   111.61821409857176
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you   86.74990510944737
by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the archduke   142.92073862061244
then that is agreed said the king and that is all i had to say to you   128.17888788117972
there is an excellent tavern at compiègne well remembered by those who have ever been there   115.31860552004444
assuredly   53.03919310183759
i indeed   141.19540584027712
this letter is not in your table nor in your secretary   87.11897680440399
i have however a wish to go and pass a day at blois   146.31471416320807
sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for   53.77791505793708
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his   89.24024040174397
chapter lxxx   83.93301803066495
see aramis as i have told you d artagnan is first amongst us all said athos   117.60589696146697
it must be done said athos   164.8474973147605
cried d artagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him   166.40733687677616
porthos left the service and in the course of the following year married mme   142.14003487056323
execution it was near midnight   96.04326500977706
during the scene of tumult andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly   153.43613652615397
either the king s or the queen s   119.89647670368177
so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest   117.27618766697536
the day after monte cristo had called upon danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten o clock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon   92.04481523024941
we had been to lucca to take in oil to leghorn for english cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy   128.41574357798993
to a convent   24.717701725291093
and what did you do   105.92459453285545
you ask me why i have requested this interview   99.65631963514616
the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud who turned away his head   112.41065272521465
have no society no neighbors   168.32884937848314
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more   130.31714798406355
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather   70.35020496159015
disappeared said caderousse yes as the sun disappears to rise the next day with still more splendor   107.34815754558794
the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on   114.74499151305056
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead   30.09362524346251
then said albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance   113.89210310530763
my dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account   159.70926785105658
the general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down   84.14256782507351
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep   78.7440791239163
and you asked porthos haven t you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligent what then is his name   124.5838744231331
d artagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority   187.95180883095804
the irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal   97.22348410822943
he attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the rue saint honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle   123.98232209584054
there are no italian banditti said debray   147.29600665740622
you should furnish him with some of course replied monte cristo   90.41614463303183
well then it is a settled thing   90.38419219421905
and does she try to make you dislike me   137.4288138724589
the trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street door   216.41144369144038
cried he he has given us anjou wine instead of champagne and fancies we know no better   105.10930161878784
still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age   75.41843990544365
and pray how do you know that   143.16933108067698
poor queen already fallen   237.70282894889004
oh his name his name   109.56834960349364
i have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what i have just witnessed   118.98572841765957
almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair   105.30335708314445
he sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect   92.17725083764472
in truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze   166.24111213321635
there was no more to be had in saint germain   105.94891434649304
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead   2.8557163768557245
he added in a low tone to porthos   127.88127695853892
and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times   146.96422259977592
yes i am the executioner of lille and this is my history   87.8798090551519
wait said valentine   137.88627640938972
at the moment he opened the door the three musketeers and d artagnan conducted by la chesnaye appeared at the top of the staircase   85.22187676209394
i can not wait   90.31219624499715
no don t be alarmed although it is to a lady that i am going to present you and i am anxious that you should love her the young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from athos he was quickly reassured   138.98186072309022
how happy you are in being exempt from all this   101.40479755004854
and you would arrest him   60.3042541652212
now madame continued debray first opening the closet then the chest   83.3468400134126
attorney but how do you know all this   101.40249438859064
and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina   105.99708836043322
at a league from beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud   110.80646885062352
who wrote to yanina   137.64154083666972
it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing   95.5370944110845
repeated the inspector   83.88037276640094
what do you mean by that you idiot   129.27775247027748
it was one of those events which decide the life of a man   195.1623377271374
said mordaunt to d artagnan and porthos   170.45487356036296
patience madame i am coming to it   110.95586311161877
he is but not willingly   122.48490721801858
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens   70.12428882756943
then d artagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation   71.70730361534163
well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of you   105.87044623122492
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort   4.922715819980041
and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts   71.6517968074892
that is precisely the fault of the age   207.69194411069225
what do you wish   51.071638445095346
30139m if you wish it my son said the major   169.27480250434377
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans   83.1596831159776
call upon my treasurer and get the money   64.91519762975973
he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney   118.73957281913172
i have seen a ghost   94.5416058499648
i feel my head a little confused   176.4165460488104
we have arranged the ransom of each of them 2 000 on arriving in france   103.11673851369912
not locked he cried   94.00085424966701
then who loads his pistol   92.49902547292159
they traced her to châlons and there they lost her   137.23980025527936
unfortunately that is true   99.91926755590137
you have suspicions nevertheless   103.71637120355057
haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured εἰπέ speak   148.89513028069408
the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage and d avrigny prepared to speak   20.95989513306074
no felton no my brother said she   142.41819288070874
as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs   133.4465765262226
at last d artagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing   87.91274634362627
said lord de winter   92.71613152203838
i know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me   113.17270131647787
he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are contriving   122.28329177564405
whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows i am at her command   137.408879651191
it was written and signed by albert   140.2255310422999
mademoiselle valentine   138.0434245945706
but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash   47.055898752824774
that is true that is true my child said the queen you are right   157.24700092590928
pardon you   48.90717632102634
can it be on account of the amours of madame de bois tracy   160.85329385587752
tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct   114.2775755915192
the visitor was introduced into the drawing room which was like all other furnished drawing rooms   172.09271646035685
yes i speak five of the modern tongues that is to say german french italian english and spanish   61.67871589867229
porthos do not lose sight of his eminence   91.55435784829439
valentine looked at her watch   40.066204047040756
in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams   98.24511567458678
ah you begin to awaken my regret   148.88325249900475
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter   174.79685983468784
i don t remember him   105.90428797467239
no said monte cristo   79.98005916542758
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time   18.215146837198873
never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty   30.749500862435085
be satisfied said the procurator s wife   127.23284934808825
escape had never once occurred to him   107.04760964237892
the first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped   155.45257755123492
0315m still dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore   144.06791168331645
in a few words porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation   215.76944260772234
oliva corsinari   66.3397375342844
the cemetery of the château d if chapter 21   124.36326650977189
nor was that surprising   136.04403448294354
ready said he with his usual curtness   98.13586843272108
i did not send for you i think   86.53346750469606
the order was obeyed   136.91370148639137
why the man must owe me a fearful grudge   87.49728831671857
pardon for whom   236.82525144405514
said aramis with a grimace of disgust   242.36879498161449
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late   154.58656217854033
the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss   3.4987479154158336
he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse   152.82958733188372
said milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result   155.860405134282
and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt   104.73637881678751
said a low voice   110.65759573457888
at midnight my dear monsieur louvieres   87.75906905158804
milady trembled   59.200675555015664
nothing is impossible replied milady to true love   83.55975913478079
go on sir i see what you wish to get at   108.81853069980772
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation   109.48308597533736
the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair   132.6101497857552
at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and i thank god that things are thus   77.16529294901824
the count of monte cristo i believe   86.91806642848448
asked jussac   93.69402920690433
franz assured me replied albert that she was sixty six years old   158.48617986606132
what a gourmand you are growing   176.73440372561748
while by giving up broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt   120.58804470972319
doubtless although less evident monte cristo s joy was not less intense   170.4843138449684
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant   113.9653352060342
the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs élysées and made monte cristo raise his head   160.92362537506096
the opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent   116.69762636893026
15 rue de nouailles   142.1692743955906
but enough of this here is my card take it to your master   153.06090100347294
athos took the letter from the hands of d artagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder   162.33397129290395
albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there   176.3927795632108
the friends embraced cordially   106.43398552488429
without waiting for the permission of his host d artagnan went quickly into the house and cast a rapid glance at the bed   91.55839622076999
all gazed at him searchingly   97.0634783506058
you do not know these men monsieur comminges but i know them first personally also by hearsay   48.378792653861126
i passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight the lamp went out and i was again in darkness   95.08832736134171
foreigner   96.56255293102949
morrel looked at noirtier who had recovered his self command and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances he had taken refuge   106.43348774763462
i knew a lord wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind   43.57746024012589
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan   88.07987749975337
i do not know the young man   191.6198949066399
thy treasure for his widow   49.171450490734856
sire said aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this   110.06053753414282
besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses   109.56571484320324
0037m worthy caderousse   159.22302170688232
had he better deny everything or tell everything   78.45206262566396
it would be very kind of you   139.5267397603481
i see that you require someone to answer for me   143.10338719660902
the king had not yet returned from hunting   164.9821333109494
come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her   186.23675314274635
who are they   206.98007572169058
i have taught you how to handle a sword   60.69402978804254
aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening   99.455751707545
i carried the infection of crime with me and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever the cholera the plague   78.0105083215542
the man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again   54.98353310339616
you can occupy haydée s apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son   17.798135517283725
then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one   121.84244712421547
the king looked at aramis with astonishment   137.81825424136372
madame will be tired tonight continued monte cristo and will no doubt wish to rest   97.04780738198939
for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets   102.1441361777719
how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardian s hand   173.48334957867266
i will go and discuss the matter with the queen   150.9119455050553
i will retire madame   90.2169452143307
thus from fondi to perusia everyone trembles at the name of cucumetto   18.361689873155782
guard her   141.22784791483713
but i was here first and will not sail second   183.81960563210245
grimaud obeyed   172.42394078021312
i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at rome   109.54567971572351
behold for what end the wretched mazarin has made use of you   117.95527345319276
to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealth that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man   99.20312877247969
faith said aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough let us revile the living a little   73.47839075572614
but pardon me are you free   127.958110410148
as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table   108.89446078076094
yet he considered you the cause of his father s dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house   119.95161122676434
d artagnan looked with surprise at his friend   98.9705923092778
the old man sank into a chair   173.62784644155283
i will see them both returned the inspector   86.24194103811001
you must not confide in anyone not even in your father   167.3849557905995
i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment   139.7599442281704
inquired the innkeeper   148.21789539886615
go for i see how impatient you are   162.11954392865465
said louise going to listen at madame danglars door   155.44188659634221
but at the foot of the stairs d artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane   174.4398547688453
john lateran   188.95625151487164
when this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women alone   132.46575423664953
10 elisabeth de rossan marquise de ganges was one of the famous women of the court of louis xiv   88.87585612422453
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his eminence   145.9486743128724
but i but i cried olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall i cross   139.8479528511517
they were talking about it when we left paris said m   142.00830310549927
he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english   120.52499433592907
who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunes   95.24530666983352
o peccato   114.3928001563211
i know nothing about it continued aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him tell the king that to morrow at ten o clock at night we shall carry him off   171.56253752853235
maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his father s neck   18.368046306954255
noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir   137.37105799190033
the cardinal repressed a smile   76.83533801739804
next week i hope my duties will afford me a little liberty and i will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here as they must necessarily be much deranged   173.83747263772142
all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium   59.89950521778808
but let us see your plan   50.427454392454095
that is i   105.61763733048575
listen my dear count   114.14239893708942
de villefort s house and a long file of mourning coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint honoré and the rue de la pépinière   9.556222704499959
come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general and of mercédès in particular   115.32202663998441
can he be inconstant before being happy   106.44727583928349
and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the prince de marsillac   155.0431381713924
and d artagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling   155.70151525903157
but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened   109.52388493136027
i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume   141.51987272349209
true remorse   208.96496300923334
adieu then until five o clock   88.47912654318421
my own service   73.52219574629856
when de winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity   104.36032428304996
i had left bearn when it arrived and i never received it until the month of april 1647   100.75967316681982
toward midday lord de winter entered   146.3933774466123
you look there for your outfit i think you said   125.11900197856903
danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel   97.31057442025354
and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands   52.21849343218636
into normandy if you like   164.01286107272944
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects   91.92354005409898
as he entered the wicket of l echelle ten o clock struck   55.77917066141569
he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain   107.68558445748347
and his eminence the cardinal   145.27332985191092
at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit   141.03002912984653
and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody   48.550827560533094
still the walls seemed to be closing on him   86.21302303298052
comminges smiled   52.06850470825785
you speak first   119.89419481888724
lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a fight   62.877023813247625
we can talk while performing that necessary task   59.942928109081954
listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my life my honor ah   56.504702085609985
thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with ice   85.11638238816488
and pray what was this quarrel about   68.7392098580899
it was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak   82.36094815059641
maximilian s avowal chapter 95   115.49825869368803
there are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at the master cried the young emulator of the furious tréville   93.81073545574345
but monsieur commissary said he calmly believe that i know and appreciate more than anybody the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be governed   68.10198223308439
are you not charged with a mission from his eminence cardinal mazarin   140.55741376087352
the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not   46.391614828839124
yours wholly and most affectionately marie de montbazon   137.26655721660617
the officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to milady   81.95069903427617

dear valentine said morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen i entreat you   96.81843724238644
and yet he said i must admit that i sent for you to appoint you to quiet service   154.50600767884532
valentine looked at the young man   182.4035129521718
d artagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through   180.2276813251907
you pushed me upon a heap which rolled down   83.73651482251292

for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast   191.43830153441522
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought   122.05450339306411
all this she owes to d artagnan without doubt   183.00286105697234
monsieur the cardinal   151.98105869737356
the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived monte cristo at the door   233.83701766987537
the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread   148.73489286530966

yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to emmanuel   88.63767019491968

oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that valentine will be terribly revenged   50.066088638620556

with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andrea s attentions in order to get rid of morcerf   135.16769956856064
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality   153.66871038159866

a capital blow you gave   53.08358374134675
do you talk in your sleep   203.37371259937532
oh i would fight for such a cause   156.32212737210762
the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety   112.08591210470377
it would be but an unsafe retreat   85.78813607205714

monsieur duke i must have those letters   152.83942449179318
upon my word said monte cristo paris is a strange city and the parisians a very singular people   178.63861827588937
at the usual time morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtier s room   171.2693459076705
oh gentlemen said the host i have been wrong   89.5672916080282
so much the better for the dogs said monte cristo   128.74937356075506
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark   189.78775439618363
do you wish to see her   83.34744056330203

but how foolish all this is   137.96203938525687
the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking houses churches museums or theatres   150.75891123481813
it was a dull foggy night   108.0673276499933
replied d artagnan for my part i am eating veal garnished with shrimps and vegetables   19.388941667056017

this was the name given the cuirassiers whom cromwell had made his body guard   99.41958256774575
and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution   179.98270483036106
so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character   65.3660003403453
this done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions   137.80844646504912
therefore you love me a little i hope replied athos in a tone of emotion   18.856191051138495

that she is called so   99.02015708743005

do you suffer much   134.09820926278252
but how about our prisoners   160.7649051560277
well answered the old man by closing his eyes   123.93624200608808
this order i believe i have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a gentleman   49.54347604084468
i don t know english athos said d artagnan   148.9188750697931
ah my dear count said albert   181.60037043709377
porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced   96.59576665414428
i will tell you what that is   77.14371417014704
this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind   139.84211935847793
i think i have seen you and known you formerly   161.21931470084758
i would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand   90.13915241488772
i am called said andrea   91.94401287271867
but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead   78.46658591625634
and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize twenty   182.7206122623668
then cries of men who were knocked down were heard   101.57798974272922
he had entered villefort s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him   59.81334322897383
the shutter where eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed   125.33422050868043
take my last gold muttered danglars holding out his pocket book and let me live here   75.81152015657733
i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure   184.60715614113724
and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest   109.28926546455385
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him   173.48975998556702
i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds   124.7434557231251
and now he said after today you will come and live with me   144.79582556060814
madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard   92.20388050793133
there were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled   49.28231387202264
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another   68.07030305852595
you to be sure   108.40144803085342
on the landing d artagnan blushed   101.76979231860273
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions   40.92991461269223
is yours   171.901261302857
do you think it will be long before he comes in   153.67251261517126
and taking out his handkerchief he gagged him   154.37267496287535
what say you duke   105.56086559130225
you wish to destroy yourself said the count   100.52764217692553
he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars   134.69299391394904
perhaps i am   105.44712731274952
would it be better to remain here said athos and take a turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort   192.7309602386954
i have been heaven s substitute to recompense the good now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked   134.74068831207575

the keeper retired   142.3209161547104

she belonged body and soul to her handsome soldier   68.84405449575397
is that monte cristo   183.8641025821483
he composed his face as we have before described and said i have read the letter sir and you have acted rightly in arresting this man   193.25763181864235
grandpapa noirtier can speak now then said edward with his habitual quickness   56.46701268315251
that the day after tomorrow i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs   121.97998737330428
why what ails you   136.51886031706533
i love you as one loves a father brother husband   145.9923865281297
he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father my kind friends leave me alone with maximilian   74.84431630563336
what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war   158.09604129259804
it is lady fairfax herself said d artagnan   118.71688556272932
and must i lose the one to save the other   145.70400712212643
at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled   132.08535254960532
or rather take horse and ride immediately yourself   56.86927714108077
de tréville i was so confident of your loyalty that i required no other defender before his majesty than yourself   145.52448724992348
why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help   136.24252244955832
i do sometimes soldier though i am   106.01367364743507
but her disappointment was cruel   26.796558820350256
and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination   112.48529208567723
no she was french but she had married in england   48.80795586900979
the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again   139.00701422578166
more than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourning coaches and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot   78.86795128856767
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady   158.93323535492226
you can speak before me said franz   190.9458007110665
the poor girl promised all her lover desired   65.95076492986186
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate   133.2012892703395
water water   62.088770747719295
simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand   104.27390985622503
why count exclaimed eugénie what has happened to your ward   126.3207421719251
he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real   153.50181172810832
i speak as one who admires you mademoiselle   147.74406235389858
do you not recollect morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast   195.35170087129046
and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money otherwise   106.80649260606192

the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel   106.8173619464188
you are ungrateful d artagnan said athos   59.433682753344286
you are only responsible for my body is it not so   158.50235683111683
well he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from paris an invalid ordered country air for his health   162.35118787209197
d artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off   147.58222963320256
the abbé opened his mouth hesitated for a moment then making an effort at self control he said and mercédès they tell me that she has disappeared   121.2061638039034
henceforth dispose of it   123.3661203901627
sire   164.0448633884284
certainly it is not mine   103.43871560045199
mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of d artagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles   55.401176244156154
fernand mondego vicomte de morcerf   148.32781156321485
the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely   130.0790317622895
at the end of a moment s conversation in which porthos hinted that a lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his embarrassment mousqueton entered   94.91168363882176
pass on before me i beg of you   143.4641489082752
there is a god said monte cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him   131.69603663292386
for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible   184.75187480669433
and you go into that house   118.6049001328649
oh no dear count   165.31402646212052

inquired raoul   100.91127916821713
d artagnan found his advice prudent   100.90418259667507
when will it take place   179.9869174176857
but his son came in   149.76803814283198
morrel to come and claim me at my own hands   151.82119458472474
himself captain himself   102.45226772584395

it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the banker s as the betrothed   86.53514742210083

she was sent by her mistress to the false de wardes   153.88686548127203
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors   135.71438652171932
monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions   98.60391111157935
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review   136.73365951927536
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind   146.86402561606238
she opened noirtier s door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily   134.09013564817693
the count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your eminence instantly   89.83926231375477
must i not be prepared for everything dear friend   116.9067584963283
why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me   86.38682338515305
the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of josephine   27.3263624223989
the three young people were talking together   132.20099638816808
what is the prisoner doing   155.55976348760368
to paris   91.64839109446515
at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel   157.71237906237948
those were the count s windows   189.22559917333814
are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness   47.25722260649911
he brings an irreproachable name which maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the legion of honor   28.00395764763097
besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life   87.45712595782045
conceal your wounds when you have any   53.156446955588216
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman   135.26129857817742
but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions   110.97457991518564
love me then haydée   95.42046209062097
while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose   136.24584432017514
he stretched forth his hand and touched stone   154.24821068398347
but d artagnan whose anger already excited was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos caught at his bridle and stopped him   170.97264030557437
i said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved d artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim   193.15033065387692
i wished to see what villefort was going to do there and i remained motionless holding my breath   148.17525658727257
you know he sent for you after the action   107.98588177555273
how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason   242.25041278397237
one might believe the queen was about to speak   129.38959328025172
if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost   109.88661022951517
he comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions   165.10618488233862
you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit   139.45502153166566
but he will not wish for only one harness   66.08524627600968
by a musketeer   111.95133814510689
oh excellency   110.86066845448357
why said aramis one half were hanged and the other half were shot   106.48393960116948
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows gentlemen   70.56469779337519
he had not tasted food for forty hours   72.16560278521754
this is indeed a house of mourning said valentine   159.15713446727898
i want you to spare time to take a walk with me   168.58002830460367
it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands   100.32749473778988
otherwise i would not fight with m   170.6419146661298
mazarin hesitated for one instant but d artagnan was firm   193.18487409046332
i am about to tell you wretched man   45.446371671928574
to fall continued king louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended to fall and learn of that fall by telegraph   209.42190487209004
i once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it   60.49553676372634
and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it   53.876510487993805
grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out   131.96759265926778
you know no one but monsieur de tréville   116.12165565128711
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault   107.02886510021864
i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat   115.20101923022474
have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon   57.32890441158455
attention then   160.41066545940328
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man   88.6980127508911
oh father father   146.04425845769924
that evening he had a long conference with several friends   39.21133697751135
however she offered the cardinal laporte s place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other   115.844432250709
at ten o clock the guns of the louvre announced the departure of the king and then a movement similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops ran though the multitude which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard   172.44372385698955
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them   171.7219837753705
he has just left me replied de winter after telling me all   147.13738765963436
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard   97.828874050516
and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts   68.89247278101013
sire said athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman   169.73069478312513
luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes   121.35240091381074
i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home   108.5194919322257
but you told me the island was uninhabited   59.62415078299313
well said monte cristo what do you see in that to annoy you   101.04768594213088
cried the young woman falling on her knees   109.85923547315838
how could i then return to brussels   112.60197704921684
just reflect a little what an agitation the queen s mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years   105.19006549138382
as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger   89.43172482253303
might not this young man be sent by his eminence   76.96256891959462
which you please monsieur   73.79527861285042
aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate   76.790930236675
he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me   86.56641100406462
the goldsmith has heard nothing of it   9.224835598509117
then in the evening i shall go to the theatre   129.5775936834142
because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you   149.6149868100826
utterly impossible   197.7094928390204
a friend maximilian   78.9098593432052
but get in fearlessly for i myself will drive you   161.44648865268758
inquired she   174.2586142404699
so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as mine   209.05531226604776
i am in your opinion a lara a manfred a lord ruthven   134.44266328256998
the latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting   92.22508833175272
de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers   126.49956735910057
for shame m   80.87039487994141
and for my part gentlemen i admire you   112.62493605531343
not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great street door which alone afforded the means of egress   160.70156380053757
then your excellency is going to the hotel   151.38787434397938
make yourself at home   112.86010093101923
i will not answer for them   190.1355936043167
nothing more simple returned the count   164.82826753845836
he s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in london   176.0482019989637
you are a worthy fellow   77.81095434547916
only leave him in the ante room as i wish to speak to you alone   48.186941988992146
said the englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance   115.46908238542765
we can scud like the pharaon under bare poles   117.77214672214116
asked danglars of monte cristo   120.84320918723533
noirtier again made an affirmative sign   99.42572358641277
now asked athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening   105.72290515122218
perhaps when all is considered you are right   142.73765425715308
poet as i am i am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti and with monsieur de bois robert who since the death of cardinal richelieu is of all parties or any party   105.14690747149594
do you not perceive that we are opposite the hôtel d arguillon which is full of the cardinal s creatures   107.73531169556195
that is true said mousqueton glancing at his friend s long and thin body you will pass easily   54.894847509182526
indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes   90.97547575965866
the door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and beard   91.79007122574832
how did these letters come   109.23010667598277
not at all my young man   82.0568425204385
the next day m   52.32043270141307
yes it is i   124.84996027446466
his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age   102.7504980550479
no material obstacle separated them   193.78547801226227
you suit me very well   124.45842016844705
yes sir i know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the ink   90.55207519738815
but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the austrian service all that will be pardoned   62.48302562914673
and he pointed upwards   22.120191176003175
oh he won t return   70.84569251237461
be prudent in any event said the countess   170.79490316336216
i shall remain in italy for another year or two   144.42688966721738
the steward could not restrain himself   72.2713510210715
thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy   81.296130950176
join the escort   165.1558106653579
at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground   76.24615419744774
he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning   101.82421638435599
we shall then have six months before us   128.61306950548328
i am going to take the waters you will accompany me   175.69297363940058
she blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them   54.58761815965527
asked hermine trembling violently   84.06402508490677
at last one day when for the hundredth time i took up my spade i asked myself again and again what the corsican could have done with the child   99.39452293746648
am i indeed so happy   128.42102460452196
with every three shots at least two men fell   144.1667794114668
morrel to aid dantès he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection   46.60767517941157
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses   138.7484686970277
my cassock is fastened by one button only and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more   99.75841410703502
and what shall i say to the people   175.2608524240297
that does not prevent replied milady softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression my being alone or being persecuted   133.50043191793958
and here we are at the ninth   114.28969353363622
cried olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is drifting   159.16323400871116
porthos fancied they were mystifying him and began to curl his mustache and knit his eyebrows   60.38628686601132
you seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going out   77.64744085079013
he will guess at least   95.02421821354535
ah capital said beauchamp   45.89759963028895
when he came up again the light had disappeared   137.87702104519602
you have kissed the queen s hand   64.42441858975226
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter   177.85025139030765
athos shuddered and turned pale   99.80739633404706
d artagnan would have remonstrated at this   107.92394501793149
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue   115.2460364279116
whatever you say my dear count   114.27017916448453
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information   103.14203803500311
20211m well said the count turning towards franz i told you there was some mistake in this   30.36666027285507
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life   190.93958248293438
and if you do not give it up well   135.09726468961023
danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes   84.2469366882035
these three others fenced against him with their agile swords   75.43909659863685
come come you are going on quickly m   176.25038756869867
besides the scriptures say confess yourselves to one another and i confess to you d artagnan   83.24467281416541
humph   85.0500982932257
the blow was sped by d artagnan   62.65993868480143
how monsieur   57.52185022397008
this is all very fine dear aramis murmured d artagnan   92.71530517789293
you have taken your revenge for the rue férou and even exceeded it   125.6606558585344
that s kitty   88.06079392088255
monsieur said the baron to the duke all the servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the island of elba   144.07216213002013
no you will not die   139.10394690868839
really said madame de villefort whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation   176.54659002343374
yes forever   151.32569363162054
said d artagnan pulling up his horse which shied   123.70417669067092
go now at once or i shall have you put out   117.18440903928088
i don t very well know what but still something   129.0593747380703
he asked pointing to the captain s cabin   103.64531067479862
i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste   93.9493941594887
there is no god   53.75151386144797
cried d artagnan breaking into a loud laugh he having heard as may be remembered thanks to the broken boards every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife   124.53393328068167
all foreign artists for as you may perceive i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors   73.03429852372557
it is my mother who dissents   69.66571191279408
baptistin said the count have the other fish brought in the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet alive   101.94340697474047
one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abbé busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning   228.34897303073546
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing   77.60571451450161
pretend to sleep louis said she   53.222784826438165
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour   120.2067873298475
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room   119.18421857654418
albert was silent   117.6463509996984
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses   185.4569247442156
you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone   51.556891986254726
the beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms   69.09421761936167
but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs which make one die of laughing   86.12742410470486
we have already asked that question said château renaud for none of us has seen him   176.77717008973858
your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the english army   187.2826442344147
and the young man went to the gangway   125.46353043657274
what diamond are you talking about   73.50850568689417
the sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed parry to pass   119.86710922987326
there can be no more doubt on that head   150.0241405500512
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future   95.82693208350143
cried the crowd   96.28888160530892
d artagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge   161.33333431230852
i leave that to the princes   44.89189074266963
conspiracy chapter 5   86.00699169681339
he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o clock   159.26883141903738
i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort   127.33960615764815
and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed   162.8254699923404
the latter seemed to have resigned himself   87.53281949016038
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp   191.94884730711232
tell the count that i am well   125.66352144024984
all is not then over   90.55699270246154
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness   126.25919371058174
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept   59.580459197147235
in three days i should have been twenty   134.37815420433103
less quickly than the women it seems to me replied porthos   100.01791697249841
come let me show you my plan   115.34450309818018
when will it be our turn to think of these things   140.10454335305002
i do not know for i have never had it madame   141.45111501470151
wait till that time arrives and find out your friends   90.07268630481624
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix   122.60108906356427
morrel and mercédès came to see him but his door was closed   147.78453768172102
d artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist   149.27825119484646
then tis something else   144.97761328712838
do you approve of what d artagnan has done   48.323551629262255
then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal spada   137.98051250754582
but remember i only allow you half an hour   174.03807833623637
namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly   156.59203818878962
the moon lessened by its decline and reddened by the last traces of the storm arose behind the little town of armentières which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its houses and the skeleton of its high belfry   170.9733910865683
he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen   77.85803967158458
and even for all day to morrow if you want it   232.1041989597805
it is evident he has been brought up in a good school   107.72901611234376
dantès house you will be at rest   55.41843337290647
my only fear is the chance of dantès being released   95.16214413160694
she looked at the clock rose reseated herself smiled at d artagnan with an air which said you are very amiable no doubt but you would be charming if you would only depart   89.44178090715073
i do not know i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells   116.98730520507806
caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp   190.9455839810254
but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow   114.29177568471368
can i trust in you   167.5583719232979
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war   48.31306924412584
the guard obeyed   107.06929135712967
your child your son your andrea   130.11019317978116
they are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions   124.39138979814228
40221m château renaud was at his post   111.58403219206119
be satisfied monsieur said planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in me   35.7810468415157
so that if this fail i am ruined completely ruined   64.4438844881955
noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character   125.59993146280516
only he represented his action as one of simple vengeance   156.34572168619866
andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him   128.87729176784052
i know my place and am not so presumptuous   178.52533694568518
i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden   167.207525733948
that is also possible   158.98262031923912
a charming young man   72.94341775966677
before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife   104.85572594349783
the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the rue richelieu   99.75017753271507
after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abbé busoni   135.58831536687063
no said bonacieux but yesterday i went to st   166.90466387878524
the old man died as i have told you   88.19546402327413
i will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know   73.97163664788101
by the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of erquinheim   116.85438649068178
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp   181.87552892301088
but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of henry iv   87.92639095984347
i observed cannon on the road   25.263110123849827
and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way replied dantès but ill concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility   171.7166827364922
and now gentlemen said planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do   171.97168043090173
chapter 7   143.89595333837877
go upstairs she said to the doctor   64.33905059069988
in the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal   133.1900986479256
where is the letter you speak of   102.55618371853579
you are speaking you scoundrel   30.0768851439705
yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq héron   198.89448435391012
and what name does the young man bear meanwhile   138.14596952020005
and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the evening   176.01657797743437
i have now been six years with m   81.94688217921639
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them   146.8620641380036
she is speaking said porthos   110.38618852469057
we have a precious fellow here   77.83943939151314
do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety   44.738772616574764
i dance   117.04072410599983
but sir said planchet with a look of shrewdness i know where bazin is   148.9080039626944
how long   35.572161671681116
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my house   131.79554516672914
continued caderousse   121.34211845257691
d artagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to porthos to follow his example   93.21707895394879
she asked with a nervous shudder   123.54298812684037
my clothes were near me on a chair   148.43535330235696
he looked to me but tis impossible   92.65023102748954
his father was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at rome   86.94910040443403
cried mordaunt   109.1412393948318
have you had it sent where we are to go for it   99.17987707247606
everyone is free to ask what he pleases   143.46858052348233
bonacieux and that the man was aramis   83.09368324930087
but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well   75.30637259135997
he led the way toward the hill of saint roche   73.71540376933595
but you pay the score   144.30688186853487
peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him   125.85016634624662
nobody but ourselves replied caderousse   121.49799787959687
d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them   47.355805989826834
i never play for i am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to gain   193.74858532206508
wild dreams had disturbed his repose   76.96965559797452
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody   124.08758082842166
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance   71.61504590417897
some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale   219.45559968589214
and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew   76.11944145010017
and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations   178.05806615411626
the woman s hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his face   122.00192499433574
he has come then as they told me   125.98605695246597
at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived   135.59880583076267
whatever command she had over herself milady could not help starting   106.12583297568139
ah pardon   132.69789386571986
and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do   142.47287070370015
and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention   32.504451539755465
but he is betrothed to your daughter i believe   70.22847320774669
i wish to speak with this gentleman   130.36934038401583
i know not whom   125.72511416095938
i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church   86.9657532640539
buckingham remained nearly a year absent   123.87264226033004
bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend   65.49944013539985
devil take him   89.96870149545637
i don t call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice   195.1175067624153
i promise   97.48343564838774
you have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you now   141.8091119944224
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire   170.78353288199614
upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead   65.20572492224463
and whose horses are these   164.7580230791798
descend my lord said the man in the moat   59.839861285423346
but consider the matter seriously eugénie   29.96676423423486
this fortress was his post as king s attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition   148.47682180819893
only to our host   154.69882664221737
i may be found here therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along   184.49497143691525
the count is in fashion   72.03717247153031
why do you doubt   125.99952559785794
of five millions and a half   178.51362797986602
what i have heard then from our good mother is true   121.0200261793907
but to their great surprise he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other and filling it your health diavolaccio said he calmly and he drank it off without his hand trembling in the least   183.70220748726285
it was through haydée that the chamber was informed of his father s treason   113.09239521410262
how did this happen   177.47714658270854
in the month of july   177.13498071613498
but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand   77.84607070363023
the story interests you does it not sir   177.5736529376998
mazarin took the letter and read it thus mr   100.87181067783699
tis done   143.66667210539626
you are to remain   89.11677077397862
permit me madame to express my surprise said the abbess   74.77097432409387
the bandit raised his head   64.60046444256568
oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how i talk to you   145.0439267237892
i wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling remorse   93.5915817719423
you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands   85.33771337700723
besides kitty would not like to live in the rue aux ours   202.7181739862711
do you recognize the carriage   81.50492417623758
laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it   123.8746097874783
that i believe   106.34157506334722
good bye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man   123.97061046177203
but never mind   162.75688547010967
wake madame de villefort   90.2395280706451
as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud   112.05404583218461
albert held his head between his hands   135.37549565519993
the cemetery of the château d if on the bed at full length and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form   133.13175966431876
in the first place he had made rough work of it   59.96973415933756
no i would wish you to reflect   123.45319714465587
the telegraph m   80.24512474533276
just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check   57.974485026204206
they will be gone   45.142906148058
he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him   182.75133625932546
the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all   62.21223714095709
yes you will much oblige me   206.62729711038418
then turning to grimaud very good my friend very good   156.90698000971238
what he is   167.6690133412266
still he had not even uttered a sigh   126.39909585752258
he had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy   39.617266179012205
yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince   107.54439764046829
d artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital   82.40828877678317
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations   94.91826405996765
athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands   145.647445746008
to speak to you about me   65.8060738171432
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man   143.39155150452348
but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to consider   40.8821795201371
he furnishes it it is true but he does not know that he has that honor   89.1040440606112
what are we to do maltese   63.08560373772368
well i will mention you to him   83.94136849405024
the devil take mazarin who does not know when to sleep at the proper time   59.32614318386943
decidedly said danglars with the perspiration on his forehead i must be under arrest   85.21884250711335
give up broussel   105.61160490816235
thank you i understand   138.51826010612933
de boville who from having been an inspector of prisons was promoted to a high office in the police   94.20921970980493
de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess   156.6971772572308
then said the prisoner let s think who it can be   126.76931068371734
you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are terrible   102.05137703336274
what is the amount   132.62328174474536
my friend said aramis take care   75.65622272154616
go to your father   75.57720405950798
said the procureur   155.2244608705178
i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give   94.62117225987404
the sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step   50.76676185394359
i only say they cost a load of money to hang and what is the use of them i should like to know   176.09224914558098
well go quickly   79.05109108310486
they gave all their fortune to the hospitals   121.24166303008101
to do what   59.8306544675177
oh the voice of nature said monte cristo   146.39912276556464
do you want anything   120.17308421033161
i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville   101.60752615308765
science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them   124.53490576749087
you see there are two wanting   83.61716775377063
you are going sir   151.362479653059
here we shall be alone and can talk   168.0341277166192
pray who may this famous luigi vampa be   102.31229939868138
but at length became afraid that the duke if exasperated would commit some folly   141.0888980607749
was not faria s fate the better after all to solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering   133.2810035837439
yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse   133.19712214162436
thank you she said   149.79844961998458
when the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed   170.0970161150351
at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man covered with dust rushed into it exclaiming my lord the cardinal   124.21340707983573
the war with spain being ended fernand s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout europe   189.289048913439
i will tell you my lord on the day when you are willing to hear my confession   180.34601143830739
at last they lost sight of each other   89.33620204716769
i fear he may have been an ancestor of your eminence   82.80939839188812
it is well sir replied villefort from below it is well   138.73720591049533
in his mother s laboratory   135.12517045136107
d artagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket   140.98345656430016
what could they take from me   96.15751802181354
i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached   137.42641751943762
bravo athos   152.4650149688048
mother he said turning towards mercédès this is m   154.2840524958895
while his name is not morcerf   40.43100011856578
but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle   143.19640021871757
said d artagnan planchet s recital agreeing with his own observations   186.568420568706
this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste   86.33660234801062
cried athos at the end of five hundred paces   136.66284360609677
and what may you have to say to him   87.59404905373576
i scarcely know him   97.92604856730829
de tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m   163.01167193813637
you have a good memory said mazarin   44.48535735992549
our béarnais was a prudent lad however young he might be   85.91131447026686
having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing room whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée d antin   135.71805330201335
marseilles the arrival chapter 2   120.02960568823418
chapter 69   40.75084463576751
there are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand   124.9593285318659
my dear friend here athos spoke rest assured if we were mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport   98.87492067541683
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle   60.55822911921768
in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward d artagnan stood quite astonished   41.575614287079006
the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was over   131.8344803623419
at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed myself dreaming   167.36525910684384
the traveler made a sign of assent   169.01990630396432
his majesty has so good a heart that he can not understand hatred   98.26403249338983
golden dreams   138.05483895020146
through you i again take hold on life through you i shall suffer through you rejoice   113.76750416952908
aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon   56.88210645088336
she has experienced much anxiety   123.19783466075312
if i did not fear to fatigue you said the general evidently charmed with the count s manners i would have taken you to the chamber   107.33495837356494
what is the use of going to day to learn something else   72.44046066974465
and the moment the door closed they have seen each other   153.36959108819377
this look of porthos s made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning   123.66929822817875
although weakened the young man s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners liberty   105.26305848284917
a credit opened by thomson french of rome   162.40548247223722
how is there still time   110.13756272297451
my chaise broke down coming into lilliers   77.7858701957143
the steward entered   110.36221922736807
yes we will wait   138.8531472171384
but would you believe it he was not receiving   80.86411193978587
in order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as d avrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to madame de villefort s room   51.45925275372815
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor   94.93548719072078
no cried porthos   197.80892976537348
as these secrets may have an influence over your life these secrets must become mine   135.5208511162998
please follow me and he went on before followed by athos and aramis   36.41312270805405
but how can i pay them   109.01525388567279
a soldier of the french army   140.68895208142726
keep the commission d artagnan   77.22454921878857
at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms the troops were firing from underneath   184.4869730216127
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled   110.18973464481832
mademoiselle paulet had already gone   144.3189957575054
ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left   141.85632211752522
however i had better find him out first since he can t want money   50.83869810162474
yes continued mme   94.06976328065463
what friends   143.49884051933265
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there   145.4716822313577
d artagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame   123.33617281818262
i enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will make   76.9753436782648
a fine thing indeed   119.42958253444314
no because i passed the night writing letters five and twenty despatches   19.267628823373002
d artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder   157.45145826796485
then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced   121.57272439257235
good day monsieur d artagnan said planchet proudly   176.45956304653413
i have then about fifty pistoles   124.6073329603993
when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him   100.44364862504739
on whom does my bleeding heart repose   86.757569290522
my lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the luxembourg   88.56276080396869
the king s closet at the tuileries we will leave villefort on the road to paris travelling thanks to trebled fees with all speed and passing through two or three apartments enter at the tuileries the little room with the arched window so well known as having been the favorite closet of napoleon and louis xviii   183.68546502070686
ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday   73.44127558537922
and the third time made this large wound   141.36274864280603
that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears   81.47808958202214
well i am come to ask a favor of you   54.36536554589492
come come madame   177.7140016826815
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed   149.9108930733447
see there now   84.0643894064167
was the reply i can do that when we get there   129.23167276511413
during the drive night had set in and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage   149.08173361578037
one of your boarders   63.46085546694596
and you have seen her   76.06068433071306
sit down my dear friend and let us talk   94.94547888232329
and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor   97.91187681631358
it was not he then you came to seek   116.6987029624195
who went out this morning   157.71728400558968
you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood   66.6446473028686
around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies   77.89167739625361
but cried felton that is a fleur de lis which i see there   61.00189456282515
then why did you smile   188.453341126516
come sweep away all that for me   165.66637081368378
i will read you the first canto   190.13500182808605
foils boxing gloves broadswords and single sticks for following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandy s education i   66.47729199680026
he knew the abbé de gondy only by report   87.79288227655238
i have not seen such a one four times in my life   77.10824308624768
porthos gave a start that shook the room   107.4175675433331
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him   175.23584708356563
do you know why   70.1561570235146
ah haitians that is quite another thing   109.92967803306803
ah fie   161.11412448124113
still by one of your forty methods your highness   48.89154068804726
i called to you but you did not answer me   87.1174730830189
villefort looked at the count almost with terror   70.53439320198487
and two or three heads carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment appeared through the openings of the tapestry   129.4495310855497
d artagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed a sign of assent   140.87843393020043
i will not even ask who they are   81.57387263502198
but she was cruelly and promptly undeceived   201.3824461290484
i would make your fortune   84.48710667699208
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses   112.09353022616563
let us see the watch said albert   80.33880088708567
in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron   91.002462182952
yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine king s cockatoo   97.90994227347537
but he had too strong an adversary   127.81064227967272
the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people   96.21444200430471
you are a simpleton said athos   126.11446007959056
wait quietly then   138.82498617697865
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him   4.131281297179314
the father of m   131.0014854910494
as he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed   175.81187659084043
the clear and vigorous intellect of athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be   131.01482256059384
as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended   100.3123132273195
go monsieur duke and return often   210.20203599078957
at the noise of m   133.77757182897454
the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away   137.82143243092642
but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father s breast   160.69805072504573
the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body   150.7956792167809
but you will not be dead   138.9964674018607
no certainly not and from this moment i will endeavor to model myself after him   49.63307543048052
i can not take you however to the siege of la rochelle said d artagnan   157.47658679099584
i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell   141.5344015702185
he therefore found d artagnan alone and as it was nearly eight o clock he took the young man with him   109.58785797251072
now continued penelon you see m   74.74196954203111
hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself   113.02147488457715
i could drink four more such bottles   32.656972661990366
almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs   153.77790194817015
the latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current   67.97910998832609
he s a fine looking fellow said another   76.71900183811374
yes so it is between perfectly upright people   143.5779425651211
and i did not recognize them   92.77091114783939
so said andrea you are speculating upon me   175.1790224170089
do not fear i will bury my grief so deep in my heart i will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with me   155.0252375010722
we want men of talent   136.12689778244433
they proceeded to the rue saint denis   75.56839719560944
so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced   121.4318827470052
and when do you set out   92.44788788974915
bazin became a lay brother   152.78212846505744
the queen spoke with some impatience   77.8113855384063
de tréville entered   77.83047906989412
from london   168.48310847210297
it had been said that evening a hundred times and scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject   112.73697744218212
chapter 11   119.00048805572548
it is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he   140.6476487300331
de tréville slept still worse   184.47536772207718
go and lose not a moment   183.15647654503488
well at twenty nine i saw valentine   74.83243567270827
dantès paused a moment then said this is it word for word the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper   98.48411664995261
d artagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to milady he had framed a little plan in his mind   84.81351170159404
full dress   103.92961149107342
i can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved   148.57944576532284
yes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice   135.1361189134175
he had retired at one o clock under the pretense of being indisposed   81.27288615087085
the king and his escort have gone this way   162.86096721373065
and du vallon   60.48347315428729
but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the lord   102.75682382824338
here is my bed replied planchet producing a bundle of straw   148.6800274388561
meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine   106.54856251173385
de boville s countenance yet he made an effort at self control and said sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum   142.74383546660715
nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed   164.66878108249102
the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour   84.39930780893118
but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths   92.93403070555286
then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more   32.01284046975273
i made the tenant sign the deed of resilition and when i had obtained what i so much wanted i galloped to auteuil   168.82933984022466
may not barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given madame de saint méran a dose prepared for his master   129.89394845687949
he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders   91.11042407923279
asked he of edmond   66.55145359482147
murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying   78.19390624634516
the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested   90.47661354444892
those at the side   163.95930836315986
of course complete ones   86.64666093613994
what did the cardinal say about me   58.25791150954567
you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back again   128.07853595902915
that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nîmes castres and uzes to drive the english from the isle of ré and lay siege to la rochelle   119.93459874848456
d artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son   123.3726601738804
the idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to her   103.31123187367666
he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on   106.10103279141039
the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite   121.9152119911293
sire stammered the baron   68.5308583844594
no false generosity count   61.16059752283342
when the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze   180.7633691123903
well i should think so since the count has found him a false father since the count gives him four thousand francs a month and leaves him 500 000 francs in his will   88.57401562466076
don t you remember porthos we saw her at general cromwell s   93.36415802796161
as you please sir said franz   124.0497558037422
it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed   86.32398788922198
six months afterwards continued caderousse the marriage took place in the church of accoules   114.90306020815682
he resolved then to defend the door bravely   128.56579753531892
then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl s heart   148.93346907025702
i ruined   83.58024368712549
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry   105.66948556135384
the request was granted   164.15166446568279
look at monsieur mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance   96.53136358564615
to this preoccupation of his vanity d artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish   135.2472726536657
exclaimed athos anxiously   88.02808624043203
thomson french   101.75259096336902
oh that coat is not his own idea   82.01788683228588
you have wounded me to the heart   101.0302931383634
gracious heavens m   163.39312208104798
a door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder   111.55209935185178
with a word d artagnan reassured them   121.35398771944416
planchet all astonishment was busy grooming them and had already finished two   185.23769570354597
ah don t touch me pray don t   171.26044179405267
fernand filled caderousse s glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the glass   141.9232729254377
monsieur i followed them from curiosity so that i saw the combat without the combatants seeing me   134.97919088929598
you will need it this evening perhaps   84.26841560470442
woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said mousqueton to himself   88.36419396882488
the king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw athos and aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks   102.98446328689359
peace brought her abdication   130.87419555051292
he wouldn t listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallows bird   116.83809682061205
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer   74.41050161307138
to which he adds that of bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my troth   142.22457523753823
monte cristo became pale at this horrible sight   114.23898517212392
d artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table   67.80681389047037
kitty came in but milady was very cross with her   214.3096768207364
all had plainly seen a woman s head appear at the window but none of them except athos knew mme   24.057403544366394
de morcerf approached her   136.9386376550242
now recalling former times of mutual distress i send you half my purse   74.31950623632628
where were you born   111.74578218474718
we will remain in the background said porthos and he will advance alone   75.58693759271283
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight   181.96015500094953
ah my dear fellow excuse me   186.17614878971128
i have served always in the infantry   168.68866987789005
the animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless   79.58228558819638
morrel repeated   142.81903299419253
the vision had fled   70.18294950932429
this morning i awoke at six o clock   86.6555083088743
three replied aramis smiling   175.1622767229474
one of the officers went to the place i directed   120.20506447935054
i go said he   112.62376211261467
as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty   124.80268769180825
what do you think of it my little fellow   93.18940657470266
i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy   122.67654757280437
sooner said aramis   59.7493803806669
had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday   87.65164844109663
and what is it to me   142.1122244132665
this letter had been conveyed by d artagnan and had arrived in time   160.5547001194225
she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room   109.1597440901985
that is not the custom excellency said peppino   66.78787357885435
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable   135.6637649634979
wait wait young man   90.38507618167874
we shall arrive at eight o clock   187.013182134367
i see it in the depths of the inner cavern   211.33799959879047
he looked around him and saw mme   98.67853514143619
indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever   64.14805131459462
maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence   149.79592063032604
summoned by m   147.9714647979136
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving d artagnan s composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands   185.91326172750428
and with my grandfather s consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you   99.30282361856946
morrel my thanks are due   97.48103544361547
give me one i will give you the other   127.8036649895226
he no longer doubted that the daughter of king charles i   130.3040943643733
gentlemen he said to his escort withdraw   71.70323628771632
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid   104.36400821816744
from tours   21.125023152279397
lucien debray private secretary to the minister of the interior   156.87692895796516
at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape   83.83030284870719
such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable companions   82.58573975526903
now we are on the right scent   192.11374769036894
so i have been told already monseigneur cried bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but i swear to you that i know nothing about it   129.99082030604342
and now said d artagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope you are going to let me into your secret   106.97297626184073
your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but i foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters   117.47418254053706
do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience   83.42306538414078
said rochefort you are right   147.7822353892102
to place yourself under his protection   190.17755397846503
i must refer again to the club in the rue saint jacques   187.84319140523414
the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased   128.5221537705053
you are captain mordaunt   35.63908873942209
they found him up less pale than when d artagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four persons   192.72082351237552
well then let us sup   72.46801341754464
courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of la pierre in which the cardinal had established his residence   157.93255819426926
go to the parliament for it was from this parliament the enemy of monarchs that the daughter of the great the sublime henry iv   102.74155204442742
at seven o clock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles   53.16364756550669
chancellor said the queen turning to seguier our old acquaintance you will open the conferences   169.25188501977414
they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year and that franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited italy should act as cicerone to albert   185.1353482752975
ali having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eyes and feigned to sleep   142.21894567964742
he is dead my lord   53.43307975612204
i must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship i must borrow from a friend the loaf i shall eat until i have earned one   22.774423639168504
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinal s directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman   190.05129108558856
and we too added beauchamp and château renaud   86.6895530157974
charles was impatiently awaiting his return   60.54106430014397
andrea cavalcanti to m   123.93660925590476
my arm and my life belong to you like my love   92.66231097715962
you refuse me my liberty   154.5827344047054
the host approached with hesitation   116.21280762500996
faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend   137.2274246997328
where were you placed   39.78692117426081
i must go to paris   149.0579393343886
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal   64.5441150661321
no madame replied monte cristo   121.45310079617238
one morning my father sent for us   113.96368748085398
you know what is agreed upon between you athos and me   168.5331072169289
cried planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more trouble   80.68148540485035
now as i dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place   52.87230722209059
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death   154.86451329983865
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos   94.73580155395562
i mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion   146.56743959105486
asked anne of austria with a movement of impatience   70.08521974603528
the king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and i must give it for them   79.10982759076
i only wish to be alone   54.959000245054376
you are all mistaken gentlemen answered athos gravely   120.81892031724382
grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole   178.2326157759016
one never knows what may happen   39.3398441022312
maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing   36.39939657219038
now is that all   134.53237045498983
explain to me why going out of this chamber isn t everything   86.35859629380337
he has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the siècle and voted five or six years on the ministerial side   188.3882643475127
yes pardieu   115.5329182895132
fear nothing there is a watch over you   116.03596397952212
yes indeed said he   137.08009672584961
oh do not deny it   104.71826862032158
and whoever serves in a french corps serves the king   105.37592010715298
but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water   195.26739317569024
interrupted porthos   95.1270377111988
you see that we are very humble monarchs sir   158.8202610356003
extraordinary did you say   83.11493371926764
everyone from the highest to the lowest degree has his place on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests as in descartes theory of pressure and impulsion   118.63191303935375
for athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his knee   48.11782257313375
never fear   163.58549894865402
since you demand my resignation i retire   91.83254310141531
she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night   158.57836312897675
oh it was not on him monsieur   137.29922277513958
for before everything i wish to avenge myself   63.080177454337594
bonacieux giving to his countenance a most sly air   59.136094455713845
you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman i ever saw   81.17323305547745
as to athos he remained unmoved   171.53911676266137
and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master s guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill d artagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of d artagnan or rather of planchet after d artagnan had saved his life   163.16727218869192
i am not obliged to read any breviary   130.3334711341684
you go to madame de bois tracy s the cousin of madame de chevreuse and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady   72.40354210964824
number 34 and number 27 chapter 16   151.05862650453253
as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations   144.82127720491584
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods   53.67957540961214
ah i know her by name   60.44874964898511
the musketeer was introduced to m   83.32007826775879
is he still one of the seventeen peers of france   142.61743462058584
behind the luxembourg   59.53384331671035
de beaufort is he still in prison   125.59981312684799
the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued god of vengeance   125.79337137801697
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying   136.84394829105327
but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy   136.35963527077294
he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party   165.88895453812063
he cried with a smile of satisfaction   84.99276502996062
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend   157.76557753894514
let us take our precautions athos   138.24237131220144
from whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence   114.73774406146434
but you will not leave me   173.10848682608247
well laporte   115.84221270760335
that is the misfortune   122.59851173139788
the voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of athos   122.0256515191006
the king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fête   28.30068048396072
d artagnan when he gave way to his own feelings which were in accordance with those of the queen had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted   189.37343708229798
asked the count impatiently   64.97797495720127
i want to be enlightened on a subject   152.12865037098433
you would not have me marry under such sad auspices   119.18663705458549
i know that he is in high favor with charles i   39.8689523994413
and the edicts   158.72332076179777
he is quite right returned beauchamp   52.26000814284245
i had been told that i should see you today at seven o clock   108.80689987419558
but you must in the first place reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wife s relations with madame de chevreuse   116.93754852901249
love me too   70.17393763699295
peter on the contrary of whom the popes are the successors continued the jesuit   167.808609733674
it alarmed d artagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a warning   111.17235711169894
there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant   201.52016362825236
this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything   49.68298371243753
the soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps   133.53511513671842
he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling   116.69700395267323
the workmen   166.47358984057612
i think so truly   196.6426590080833
i will tell him my gloomy story   128.96152451216813
a dungeon   118.44254147732606
do you think of escaping in the same way   103.31995470463283
but thanks to this diamond replied the young man   146.67847666106516
while he was doing this d artagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared   120.0483541989987
now i have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics and that in all humility that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have caused me to neglect study a little   86.24490022508121
and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said porthos   92.28620166751287
we came here with the intention of asking for something to eat   112.87434575290995
for my own part i protest that should i ever go to corsica my first visit ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of colomba if i could only manage to find them   107.9790849327222
the sea immediately rose to his waist   144.8443486492315
he called out his name and cried for help   224.67816722458292
the lackeys were sent to their several posts except that grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway   127.94773885576711
well then take him said the cardinal   157.9634676832937
plan of campaign chapter xx   116.3090802380756
and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever   80.36372626726794
it is unpardonable   84.84759126169729
now if i die say to d artagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me   105.48075667127074
your lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me   104.87714763494985
at these cries all who were in the hôtel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers   119.7120805295702
well sirs   189.29523523954634
now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m   99.89570817646643
none whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot   97.86050067955163
cried the procurator s wife raising her eyes toward heaven   200.5459831154912
but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette   162.08446482514194
noirtier had once made a will against you against your family in favor of the poor in fact   107.38116169782633
said the concierge   70.87481831262969
imitate me   125.71408308386566
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself   179.55152178572013
but i understand that she is going to italy   118.76966212602274
when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes   89.96331313162331
is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante chamber   131.4219864815471
for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party   109.85417869834689
then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience   128.80241724463576
you love me   3.9688586962385983
when you please said d artagnan   97.39385341528548
her mouth was small and rosy   77.04859324809402
indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all   174.36827910691756
she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor   68.26788034431112
i will undertake that   217.8457660131196
one word more said monte cristo   112.83073186681824
and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty five   124.49316540283726
ah said d artagnan is that the way you return to your apartment   230.90553749803485
50155m well be it so   110.65643608976903
de tréville announced that it was time to go to the louvre   153.35976453299446
but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the devils   110.59837591295418
i ask much too much perhaps for i have no title to request it   116.78532405402414
in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law   177.59808995065453
at that age he can not be a traitor   140.36516013131455
it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal   108.77454313254283
inquired valentine   60.96659067064532
besides there was no tranquillity in paris itself   115.01195185815523
you will appear at this ball   15.056827390889637
going along d artagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd   117.09391624675156
d artagnan continued athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge   114.69770477770109
you saw the person   172.0842400888442
and what have i to do with your ill humor   154.78551457130092
oh my king said parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall   45.85044293319797
repeat your story saint laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the tale   159.4063313512524
he pretends the air of the faubourg saint honoré is not good for me   178.39902959084515
five answered groslow one every two hours   125.42568748192387
cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it   140.38488633263282
i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle   123.32401106968078
you only know that this money exists   134.00219342539845
but as for me by holy truth i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice   193.66818119645473
such was the count s yes   97.65730719375709
matters are going all right   159.514758600345
she may have forgotten something   188.06388295410085
you are wrong my lord   86.89015450855564
in that case we are as well off as we wish   144.10947742370325
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him   38.987264130895966
when they entered the port it was already night   193.3602329208012
there is quite a style about them   113.03527072580037
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio   14.092990042396181
debray m   140.30938201179322
suddenly a voice was heard at the wicket   94.97004342760383
i understand it   63.217679276909614
every five minutes albert took out his watch   138.4802066975417
friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of notre dame   61.68914742506261
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause   189.2154266626568
then cried villefort was it you who bought m   109.40725761717498
the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased   133.20129281065496
sir let me see my right hand correspondent   98.94901035950777
the mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe   85.8404689063589
asked monsieur de cavois   106.84975679677927
but pray sit down   97.26055110485979
albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by beauchamp found himself in the banker s study   91.36088451683467
and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done   138.60000994906093
at this speech of aramis the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips   56.20804227475152
my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me   175.54648988707837
the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner   3.7617037938141635
athos and aramis were more and more astonished   101.9213623579717
the blood rose to her head and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her robe   167.7457987759551
and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal   59.51326206711969
this time there was no longer any doubt   135.0838481364196
my faith monsieur with great pleasure   65.95799035606981
yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone   162.69820460432635
it is well for albert he is not in the army said morrel   154.55808183983825
ah monsieur bonacieux i never did love you much but now it is worse than ever   70.97882146110254
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself   102.17852760212035
pronounce one single word muttered d artagnan and you are a dead man   98.59221470268784
but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said monte cristo   38.21368054288514
well then instead of pitying me you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your mistress   106.59242048796906
are we then to go to war   83.27689156562252
what more   104.37021604324434
the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc   148.6576811801377
de tréville s hôtel at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship haven t i   117.23771671765839
d artagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt   100.88925279920812
and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoled you the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power   119.76959124346317
danglars and you caderousse   86.74274588544876
perhaps   133.42418480338694
the rest concerns myself   88.31567105449903
a charming little seamstress whom i love dearly and from whose hand i requested a few lines as a sort of keepsake   125.36183245468786
but tell me said andrea am i to remain bareheaded   186.04283621134726
it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within a timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard   137.9786945867951
it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine   99.00946570129459
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them   128.10833543207832
he did not however lose sight of milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face   171.2970778880189
we may well pity the poor fellows   157.96662435439515
neither gold nor rank   84.82750493241137
alas said valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead   227.2939622417842
felton then had spoken in her favor since lord de winter had not been willing to listen to him   134.70875223744105
villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him   106.15298265711712
and yet i have punished her i have dared to tell her i have repent and die   130.86987618601609
they passed to the third story   103.98409381019545
then d avrigny spoke   115.26033439395918
how is it arranged   150.99769196600323
nobody knows him   157.6314508877132
bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him   94.84392878228019
they use force the scoundrels   189.06166622659913
at this instant m   115.55058900012764
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman   95.38709426228671
to saddle   143.20537295389323
have you been to the general   136.2454155344938
you will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box   75.80211307308831
and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything   83.48176302021795
the blood no longer flowed from his wounds   135.41149283932657
said he is not that you whom i see yonder   147.73720908338595
well and then   57.410068234939075
ah diable   76.4801935119497
and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there   180.12189174795967
i fancy i have seen him before   158.9853580531475
it was said that she had poisoned her second husband   137.39065313715793
in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into life valentine the daughter by my first wife mademoiselle renée de saint méran and edward the boy whose life you have this day saved   127.19870028034208
i think so forsooth said rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the bastile   77.4171411182345
she takes a pleasure in my conversation   122.73352928782715
it is to be to morrow said aramis hastily   51.77193697224548
it was like having a spy in the enemy s camp   161.95538024874244
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand   143.72837259791908
he took you for buckingham   79.84481878592098
one of them stationed upon the top stair naked sword in hand prevented or at least endeavored to prevent the three others from ascending   115.20956662931398
no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill   100.5702542686553
i am not a fighting man at all monsieur and i am afraid of the bastille   179.89246172847862
everything conspired to prove to d artagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had happened   156.49341345029916
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain   83.6571530863322
but i do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment   84.3182135844919
cried she is it you   203.24972810354947
de tréville felt himself something like samson before the philistines   123.85417980129587
tis well said athos i will take care of that   136.1778926753687
caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate   79.98575283869783
but he found athos quite himself again that is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men   138.36151185416372
and he hastened to the door   91.9013217006744
but sir you spoke of vigilance and protection   84.43574855981737
yes yes said he   103.66194891803845
he therefore mounted his horse and disappeared   93.92309531432025
the worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to him   135.16983710897654
it was ten o clock when they arrived   136.24685948154672
suppose any one came into the room   93.4234591576366
well sir the rupture of a blood vessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a second   108.96993532677824
murmured renée   195.11593486668613
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak   187.0975679616439
ah that would be a great pity said villefort   184.1383766240566
only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing   110.51904626302795
no said morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my enemies   112.7233072459519
firstly i wish to communicate   92.78834598933713
in something else in something else   107.74843996389012
one might believe this is an allusion to the queen mother   93.24419318511404
then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinal s door   69.85166154799596
we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican   129.1322194560019
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses   121.99917772456706
but who are those others   85.31168195286322
then who are you   45.75289508292245
what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silver are they all for me   44.56236758142042
the young girl kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her eyes   139.77947619294446
it really must be doomed   106.17950967716729
the count s brow became clouded   173.6630589086413
but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than any   108.2408187748483
we shall soon see said porthos in his tranquil way   85.41638970961091
yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide   145.7622898759979
do you hear the guns pray   141.85652211236226
count said de winter for whom do you take me   109.59708903690465
no cardinal   114.10754753659754
opened the door entered and shut it after them   173.38347942051618
but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story   121.67260923901499
whereas on my honor monsieur de chavigny though i ve been here a week has not ordered so much as a tartlet   160.00238611782575
for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock although i had believed it to be later   49.68675150316935
so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose   55.02890533878159
then those who dwelt in bonacieux s unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of furniture   161.44219876569906
the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod   165.68750671287592
let us withdraw   132.86300299607518
replied the gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the german tongue   76.603372428584
but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation   76.46173210060306
i am brother to parry his majesty s lackey   194.77095829656503
no no do not be deceived   14.047045478366812
i wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business i was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself   106.22477047527762
but the voyage was not ended   245.7910479972894
without a thesis   100.8412361976786
they were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of d artagnan and porthos   167.93196775503128
essed of ingots gold money jewels diamonds gems   163.74788351620327
i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation   197.90855042805927
d artagnan related how he had found porthos in bed with a strained knee and aramis at a table between two theologians   62.07545603719993
in the next place you are in trouble of which i am very glad as it gives me an opportunity of placing myself at your service and god knows i am ready to throw myself into the fire for you   56.425045052121284
let us visit them said the inspector with an air of fatigue   143.80114361142023
400340m a note was in consequence addressed to general de quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the 5th   171.5699399693748
d artagnan was radiant with joy and pride   115.81737367198929
bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband   152.18314826814483
madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room   153.7135908853695
albert sprang from the porter s lodge to the steps   41.50891344971164
and yet at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts   96.05514108416038
in this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night while m   57.753087888662385
the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms   56.064895525089625
i do not offer you a million because i have it not   127.75513089184493
i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act   117.8794979907014
i registered their deed of gift yesterday   191.7798793629044
i denounce the crime   163.28541224961617
there were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand albert had already expended three thousand   170.3187062669772
his father   121.95313699655752
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done   113.58860890209039
to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison   220.82166605980666
then the porter raised some difficulties but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night   128.24401834086842
every time i see you is a fresh diamond which i enclose in the casket of my heart   69.15999001987404
never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me   101.2249994639105
did you not tell him just now that you wanted money   107.96812804626512
my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me   168.11034781513993
luxury has everything   163.01491226086355
adieu my friend adieu my father   6.4432145156617935
she will receive five shillings per day for lodging and food   130.19714928860543
in that hotel   132.33461485131502
at these words he blew a whistle   174.23817546558706
everything answered franz your voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead   31.162350858384684
that is the usual way is it not   105.0252969827519
53   137.36619859574046
and the shore from the point of l aiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles roberges and feluccas   163.96874894491847
the soldier went out leaving the dinner served   154.17599884630258
mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him   108.7846379390028
ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him   138.47996654219455
athos changed color   126.08500316716388
i will turn abbé   155.99391195575268
come my friend said danglars seeing that he made no impression on peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine   22.692481298290986
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic   48.505032367500405
your arms my lord what arms   128.4285089871954
my heart is that of a musketeer   54.74026011533085
the king s room   174.23838592567972
as to m   116.74006751100738
that s what i wanted to know   110.75724015820316
such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars   85.92632403316891
where is that armentières   70.28515409220162
said danglars laughing in his turn   150.3714615069897
he will of course have an escort   153.82969411026608
where and how   110.80730642069419
i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first   158.4935929836988
and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse   63.12707809555297
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan   118.48118321069946
he smiled   125.13834313479417
in the meanwhile the promises of m   66.3872015812099
in my opinion the people are right   136.23248192253004
noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning poor m   136.76553123149415
it is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed   81.96140746402013
laporte burst into tears   72.80613683039192
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul   48.94703128368249
the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dantès question   130.25973072592348
bonacieux had not been abed   113.74284872768979
how in the wrong   83.72535027636486
she found m   119.57777214752207
athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality   124.28551290837551
laporte obeyed   6.74447335710903
my dear count said morcerf i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely   120.56022511909781
d artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the rue d assas is now situated breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night   84.63618639031752
the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language   141.1676474424057
was faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to faria   14.533917114815381
the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating the notary the notary   113.31076538599729
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur bonacieux   162.474692220774
but not mine mother replied albert   138.646271237825
oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us   89.19376625668568
everyone hastened to purchase moccoletti franz and albert among the rest   224.68846733731343
you have seen me twenty times   114.54176160120237
take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever   65.65375841391904
well then you ll build some   108.68640861572837
the young people uttered a cry of joy while maximilian raised his head but let it fall again immediately   115.9550917175534
and suppose you can not pass through them   130.47308323374423
we had better take the opposite direction eh   181.42749266890917
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator   52.69424216234902
true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit   105.59500806698536
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door   180.27361269941338
we did not see her monseigneur said athos   198.17599990427334
i now repeat that i was born at auteuil on the night of the 27th of september 1817 and that i am the son of the procureur m   220.22330214857107
but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up   128.8466457056296
albert extended his hand   145.12288044386153
trousers said grimaud still squaring his accounts   128.1423727598671
they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions   138.87924423143738
yet i let him die   162.0517808615993
at these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token   144.93374038440177
if they do not bring us peace we will give them war   127.01713534812585
for a thousand pistoles just that amount the beggar   148.56980066576452
my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir   122.77188942989096
there was yet no one to be seen   135.14912710452367
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur   90.30222404519589
well then i am your servant monsieur baron said d artagnan though you have names rather difficult to recollect   162.73052124707849
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted   144.03257206703623
eight thousand crowns amounted to 48 000 livres   132.22231603893422
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution   109.02801523330933
du vallon next me   31.351656133430325
the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau such is the instability of the human mind was the sullen face of grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope   124.01419366660829
i love him   273.5617946915737
d artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen   162.4814330825469
upon my honor   106.57700581885935
my son said anne of austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered here is monsieur d artagnan who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women   22.62081622703596
this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy s ears   99.76375871916404
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room   148.97852614448462
good said mazarin i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation   149.58479274483767
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground   78.8210294312947
and people are wrong d artagnan   81.03702433052592
you laugh d artagnan   122.60803541141883
said caderousse astonished   111.78365520921402
the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard   163.04818546668122
beware monsieur   176.40206125088918
perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile   129.90243806050051
at all events i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner   108.7756338612241
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal   71.91157162138816
the only thing that astonished d artagnan was that his friends had never thought of this   126.19916919419495
there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt reassured   130.4623904599915
go my dear boy said old dantès   155.5201590704112
mercédès who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond   148.21219826031472
unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded   123.26612266308817
as he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said ah   126.86411148374825
and bassompierre was right   173.3841923060154
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box   105.50992173211081
but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise   62.41416246357187
but how did this horse come into your hands mousqueton   90.32102758366693
you will not   100.27492993930557
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal   133.7579246943448
in appearance not heart   140.38594621303554
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mother s neck and kissed her her own eyes streaming with tears   127.63703036169169
precisely madame replied monte cristo   105.00109179086742
and the name of this lord   142.91118453165555
you must be well aware that this requires reflection   122.10625073663219
what does all this mean   116.2146553322684
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone   41.72554381409826
i perceive its utter impossibility   160.53419497815503
then my strength gave out and i fainted again   129.3928223514163
well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow   52.75613250469496
the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance and who answered to the last of these three names immediately quitted the group of which they had formed a part and advanced toward the cabinet the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered   117.12922212674042
it evidently was there i had turned up the ground   80.790161604524
said gondy laughing   178.55487669537953
oh yes yes cruelly   128.90639713248925
then you love me   108.5312687411763
nevertheless or find some one else continued d artagnan turning his back   71.65454964626643
i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandy for instance between le havre and boulogne   65.81936606757945
now then what had i better do   106.49331940608276
my lord you are right and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last   144.53031424905947
do so   161.71549193700176
i am ready said maximilian   73.60244745543672
murmured my father   86.92351520145759
do you not know these bits of paper   125.38194888366229
yes your friend at least hopes so   130.898108734317
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so much   139.06514041117265
but whither shall we fly whither escape   88.44813106369601
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us   140.15646646255163
perfectly safe and sound my good host   86.2362605118284
it was already too late   157.68669405099635
but unfortunately i must wait   123.41188252165354
to travel   13.713368788345775
italian cigars are horrible   121.02624770635045
in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callot s temptation of st   3.251353951578949
the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared   120.25795882684693
ah yes monsieur commissary   132.2254000856799
what do you wish me to say   88.02507563659745
so it is my dear vicomte said athos laughing to make bad ones   51.56262863254344
cried d artagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men   93.47039188189771
seeing however no one there except a musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he recognized at the first glance the cardinal   75.72783842552339
you are a perfect amazon eugénie   112.49829156959731
mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw   54.276100002154706
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abbé d herblay of whom you have often heard me speak   89.44687727814582
having seen jacopo fairly out of the harbor dantès proceeded to make his final adieus on board la jeune amélie distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him   88.51853856817114
the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension   128.98248504232825
come then thou regenerate man thou extravagant prodigal thou awakened sleeper thou all powerful visionary thou invincible millionaire once again review thy past life of starvation and wretchedness revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted and where despair received thee   72.39417341196862
it was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it   77.13313257390195
i don t see what is to keep me here   146.85201165132185
go then and take the waters of forges or any that may be more agreeable to you and recuperate yourself as quickly as possible   156.58062002868814
does he still live   83.38779868688944
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier   60.27869396797658
everything appeared as usual the precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire   70.02586392041584
every article of dress hat coat gloves and boots was from the first makers   81.9767201457189
said athos oh no it is impossible   134.9167298814614
it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl s mind as to the reality of the scene   118.76249868781996
23 germain pillon was a famous french sculptor 1535 1598   180.8733017073451
every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous cardinal mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence   134.45776619019517
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre   71.78138640595989
there now shall we start   56.371459519419375
to the tower saint jacques la boucherie   89.88217752604015
it remains here   88.7639156913706
replied the queen in a low voice   64.62575808905814
you are not guilty toward me and i have already pardoned you   144.36458389409887
dantès seemed full of kindness   168.84387331487935
edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said   60.09364102036403
the hôtel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right   106.27216709685689
yes in life or death   169.98080090410244
can you conceal me   87.97567760990367
0279m under pretence of being fatigued dantès asked to take the helm   0.4968810713550056
asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain   178.53015624255585
take care albert said franz   59.08897032623434
ah well exclaimed château renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied   172.22477091268087
one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat   97.3827159645189
your eminence may be perfectly easy replied d artagnan   102.52431874851247
he asked the sergeant   44.58911956362272
but of what are you accused   150.3802153702364
you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days   92.99189932555034
next morning le moniteur contained the following it was without any foundation that le messager yesterday announced the flight of don carlos and the revolt of barcelona   99.78867384354196
if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought i knew him   151.6980187063038
the conversation took place in english a language which d artagnan could not understand   72.86265671219334
at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered   129.21492144007692
de bruy   75.99707921710169
and yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame i proposed to chevalier de rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze horse   70.97021983641531
i was going to say if i were in your place well   202.8599833992725
i am then your prisoner   115.42656854830288
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort   85.28457319117851
no monsieur quite the contrary   156.5998632593383
anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her   10.838540700705352
but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting master   161.0125440335629
d artagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails   45.7884579024646
he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness   106.56919865665222
the king don carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges and has returned to spain by the catalonian frontier   178.97916114530193
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly   107.36503321452778
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary   150.21535232219506
arranging your papers apparently   149.90421575282346
no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a worn out garment   79.21675275939367
the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence   81.23097925931737
his eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man   119.63963754497712
well said he let us go to valentine   110.71721958009843
grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face   168.46979749500912
thus d artagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means   136.4949746828891
but they were not alone your musketeers   114.3367626384878
yes my lord he replied   186.33973645431598
and strong in the multiplication table which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him   215.21169505850293
he must know where his master is   107.06052759459354
most willingly duke   154.86786751108056
these proceedings made d artagnan and porthos draw back   206.70348871312342
then aloud well my dear aramis do you ask me why i came to seek you   121.2099340426141
are you satisfied gentlemen   155.7731147589535
even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead   105.03428800347501
this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm   113.50106139408736
it required all villefort s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him   90.22405413749797
debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly   75.38146831949935
this door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future protector   80.53446170200256
as soon as possible   102.888013958777
i would as willingly accuse myself   132.20999612597458
my dear planchet i am the happiest of men   126.9544179984605
this is torture to me cried athos   52.78704339287254
the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese   122.18140053144467
the same password   155.6652106863354
the more so as it will be the prelude to a better   168.84318088260176
and by what gate did they go out   131.36608223424048
i said i wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man   177.23625754249258
ah my lord   99.37486037320166
well in spite of that d artagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her   57.6752647416572
if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe   118.86137253144324
it had disappeared   53.068659139871365
one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting   113.75139690999555
if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every point   93.89778685872547
said the woman crossing herself   169.96951038586752
he appears to be a resolute fellow   225.62066087441917
the interests of that kingdom and those of england though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the same   45.404925148463036
but nothing absolutely nothing   146.14872371935556
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany   119.21084647437623
in the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her mistress   75.47901952193271
comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview   34.70554254967054
that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life   54.268287098617435
did you inquire the names of those three musketeers   188.37707890867705
if on the contrary any repulse should take place you and your men must fight to the last man whilst we and the king proceed on our road   106.68023396745481
because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird   185.31732006063322
de tréville how the affair came to pass   26.956149338707192
sir you alarm me   109.78063108451335
what think you of citizen luigi vampa   126.50616030257235
and what are you going to do in paris   89.73800119718972
mordaunt bowed   166.41065858295187
go then sir and god keep you   98.73119633166134
and he rushed out of the study   138.68486006903962
a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept   31.76525277716776
only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else   145.7417679402574
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair   100.103786299001
the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression   127.05151944038928
i resist my father s order and my dying grandmother s wish   107.46062593663571
this is the abbé of whom i spoke said the doctor to d avrigny   107.7788292351577
well is all said   93.8610499781091
you know something of that as well as i do i think   170.10330852336412
how few to day exist   153.64876743920772
well asked anne of austria when d artagnan reappeared what does it mean   132.08771538908366
he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague   153.7226211555436
he looks like a big bug said another   198.03048783815098
twas so then twas so then murmured the abbé   176.59891696057625
hold sire said d artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep   110.58924424372327
the others followed   78.66986021478088
d artagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order   48.85385404176235
devotion   181.52265309426764
you dislike him i think   74.10567082774921
and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love   112.98431394784883
aramis continued and yet while i do belong to the earth i wish to speak of you of our friends   34.675183336773344
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis   59.61675100025455
then obeying the orders given him by athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached de winter s inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word   158.43101182886517
then we are to have no more pistols no more despair   75.40107954949347
i am not at home to any one said the duchess de chevreuse to the footman   87.84657024549594
good god cried kitty there is my mistress calling me   40.406396909148455
paris has been sufficiently punished   94.45387322566114
but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens   84.19198743125796
and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table   162.8686996696557
if it is i whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner i reply that i hold monsieur le marechal s opinion in every respect   121.5906775189885
peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of morra with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto   142.15703445632988
their masters are dead   63.58073666264716
the duke uttered a cry but grimaud did not give a single moan   176.80862850925038
what is the matter with your highness   92.78969356242459

i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me   85.41392030195854
a soldier of the usurper then   55.33903199639089

the carriage rolled rapidly onward   74.6880302855601
nothing i was speaking to myself   158.80847235493732
pale and trembling milady repulsed d artagnan s attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of bed   152.94078585704335
said d artagnan they will miss me   217.73908076853456

yes with count cavalcanti the marquis his father madame danglars m   89.25609025093117
at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened   203.54819299439004
third rate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that   124.58316350432463

why this very morning in my rooms he made his entrée amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement not even excepting château renaud   143.3147052644823
behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her   94.73390687884842

the next morning when kitty presented herself at d artagnan s she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days   183.5762918219218

he called out to the postilions at every ascent   49.383636622057864
the note is changed   85.09208041613792
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise d artagnan s vigilance   166.45764637657658
at the moment you left his house   156.08094867854982
the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation   48.35042585130118
ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence   106.38084117321493
i know it sir   75.23681373479286

you ll be shut up again in the bastile   31.468901013635048
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me   145.37018557345456
and you believe he died of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse   47.701594396375285
franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli and that he had lost sight of him in the via macello   110.35616353780227
so he has   121.76581146148312

he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs   72.3548255545721
my dappled grays   109.55362119443635
the count has only been two or three days in paris but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the marais is and if he does not you will show him   73.40091073467939

the other was an old one eyed cashier called cocles or cock eye a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee hive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it   179.78488011143875
morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study   49.745928077007534
then she rang for her lady s maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might happen   74.94450461976558
the world is a sepulcher   74.03046844803563
a tailor who never disappoints you   91.6570258631563
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis   101.59271736226181
as i rode by the count s house i perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain   145.71345772667746
the discussion is going to begin again   101.26361266898374
at these words he drew away the stone and showed teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror   23.114424734770438
the whole intrigue is political and there is not the least question of love in this letter   132.7542399369524
the queen is likely to follow mazarin s counsels and to have me tried   71.24687312170921
said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before mercédès herself   196.32198099360295
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count   170.08229888671394
i tell you so to prove to you that i still hope   111.76684778771369
yes monsieur replied the terrified citizen in a tone so low that he was scarcely audible   131.7921295113007
then gloom settled heavily upon him   98.54296633197976
0027m how could that bring me into trouble sir   114.71295576876885
but as after all excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable the procurator s wife had been tolerably liberal that is be it understood for a procurator s wife he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind   112.79349819285734
mine money   150.49513959322587
said bonacieux protruding his lip   83.89040493539102
be it so cried aramis   85.23219674416656
perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you when i am married   174.8986001433159
then both mounted and departed quietly   91.14561400541618
adieu dear sister till your next swoon   119.61699655529517
although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual time   135.7318848256405
come gentlemen cried harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be off   168.29553527702427
but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste   108.01687801429512
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open d artagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid   132.38526823218717
it was your excellency   123.82090455122442
prudence is a virtue   186.1109583251493
as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap   66.75074993787449
13 ali pasha the lion was born at tepelini an albanian village at the foot of the klissoura mountains in 1741   110.80373236955897
he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound   61.894391256301844
it is impossible to say whether charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of d artagnan s voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself   48.324953024285804
but you will see him then   143.6410433624594
his fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king   54.51826283437857
whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you   130.50993034838615
he let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury   97.89987280844028
the standard   161.01051000507542
at this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name   174.40501436930296
monsieur de rochefort said gondy laughing are you a boy to play with firearms   48.91675938212937
when on the 8th of september that is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life the abbé busoni whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him   148.36193138687713
i regret not having heard them   54.93417055487226
morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained   145.87149659175165
but what has de rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room   113.01106538948285
i see nothing but faces a yard broad   150.1366600006822
but why did you not dare to speak aloud planchet because you are afraid   89.30114974158406
she appeared to me charming though rather melancholy   133.7514684573109
that is likely said d artagnan   138.63221170543574
and thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my god   90.91809239433387
here s a promising fellow and it is i who have found out his merits said monsieur de chavigny   47.95255388281544
cried the viscount springing towards her   68.62047781387702
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over   107.35595160680312
the result of these reflections was that d artagnan without asking information of any kind alighted commended the horses to the care of his lackey entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight   214.15394247990724
this reasoning seemed to d artagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted   132.6331605001373
now remember that you are a general and do not go and drink   123.94757349854086
well albert said franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels   145.82165424296278

adieu then and be of good courage said athos   245.76049619990647

he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything   222.41867735823223
albert repeated danglars shrugging his shoulders   91.13259490047767
it was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood   107.68729435502348
milady opened the window and made a sign to mme   97.0299452281809

as hope however is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man he finished by hoping that he might survive even though with terrible wounds in both these duels   79.34035591392274

the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugénie used in leaving it   33.448498352165345
his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples   165.59620557559253
charles shuddered   113.00739496392146
he felt the stiffened limbs   136.41292276036725
in that respect unlike you my dear aramis for you are still the same   139.60145135375166
and your precautions were successful   177.2938741962791
i confess observed monte cristo that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful   104.8238655555852

certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by m   55.30483526115586

five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage entered   148.0917285652999
edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison   121.76883916670724

perhaps we shall meet on our road   188.45698773336937
now on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it eaten   106.28203315027658
we will be with you at that time said the major   73.08926969410984
ah reverend sir tell me do you wish me dead   119.95317924974032
porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the king   59.005253079894146
the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means   46.99490333877564
and who told you i had no affair with a lover   100.62490845184705
danglars asked for a knife and fork   109.01383496442519
it was time and he sealed his will with three seals   152.55146731216448
for one second d artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword   152.3592463527138
do you then really suffer   136.66600877417565
therefore when at dessert upon a sign from d artagnan porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone porthos said d artagnan who will attend you in your campaigns   164.021635591205
to send you the chaise as soon as possible   112.96246596820396
voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished   118.7343958279574
i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and i will take m   169.0878749886934
we enroll no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so   105.83848911494547
you would be revenged on him because i do not love you   105.57488886485882
to her majesty the queen of england who has desired me to present you to her   159.40459270887584
but i doubt that your object was like theirs to rescue the holy sepulchre   70.85620371243493
i will do nothing of the kind   140.67671305618725
life is so uncertain that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach   100.62120208232604
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover   91.14246606897564
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother   185.5887856656464
without me you would both have died   83.17118270292133
responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain   190.06690699198816
and i am afraid you will refuse me the favor i come to ask if you do not know to what end i ask it   7.218462377993916
have you tied the knot   134.64597087721017
40270m chapter 93   154.05465642974116
she said that   131.99437527640418
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered   153.9900442040987
well this man   169.99048945347613
he had written to the duc de beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive and he would find paris tranquil   62.15662347047058
i tell you she loves that infamous buckingham   7.843918858966617
whom heaven protect from evil   61.612393299778844
he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future   100.29659056216693
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp   152.85451521911392
god keep me from it my dear monsieur mordaunt   173.17222482331516
you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know   69.62462290408841
gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one   108.26577895818124
my dear count said albert i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready   33.968855093012536
i do not know only he has followed your grace from the palais royal stopped at the louvre to wait for you and now leaves the louvre with you   76.01842551312109
i am told that there is a general insurrection   109.05002137300545
i was uneasy about him   67.4379660302632
i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course   140.2120376380449
the only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself   51.22595410871294
she placed the poniard in his hand   127.95968832448578
but fortunately i do not want for anything   47.04045068856364
some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel   133.62872687224987
is not the greatest thief in the world monsieur the king s secretary le camus who came to paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions   101.79830496921717
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertaker s men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial   172.00910203447177
d artagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had not whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subject been able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence   138.53334732745623
28 rue de la fontaine   143.79431757108034
andrea only calls himself count   70.45019416711935
these two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet de chambre who opened the door of the vestibule then another which seemed to be that of a waiting room and showing them two stools your orders are very simple he said   177.45030658087785
the law chapter 100   167.1071145670478
and i am very glad you recognize me dear m   99.65070009419682
look at my face paler even than usual and my eyes red with weariness for four days i have not closed them for i have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for maximilian   30.09649336051247
asked the guide in astonishment   104.80264107941142
no sooner said than done and i lost the horse   85.37778916856234
very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance   73.44598431962437
added monte cristo   168.64612201453428
night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps   182.48591491816097
madame coquenard i gave you the preference   108.65510620012572
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away   81.30124409895191
no my lord i still plead   148.58948528725546
have you gone mad my dear friend   206.6391642596098
and maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls one fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow   137.50719508976954
de villefort to m   155.4073551201241
la ramee ran in haste to obey the call   77.59255737273597
gentlemen cried chatillon the truce is broken that is evident   146.08269244828873
you see i am calm and strong   127.60381450739031
no let us belong to no party but remain friends   126.35467658074238
oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretch to reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me   109.19604772523701
i don t know them but the four other noblemen called the englishman my lord   81.73261388299301
danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with love   150.80419482991238
and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert s side   50.382919107285886
she closed the door after her took the duke by the hand and after a few experimental steps grasped a balustrade put her foot upon the bottom step and began to ascend the staircase   61.85320765341113
should you meet on your journey a certain monsieur mordaunt distrust him in a letter i can not say more   79.0105353219941
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right albert s breakfast room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden   156.61807600422935
truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone   127.99887038248566
oh no no   118.33299663292635
suffer hunger   48.20899792673039
but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits   178.8459608978336
my house   23.922245616022764
yes replied teresa with astonishment   52.71924676693759
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance   148.9220927791024
i have said what i have said   81.35912046704487
opportunity is the martingale of man   125.31939966272397
one can do it   90.85034789423469
i would swear to it   128.9737219340946
he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber   113.58951795899436
50153m everything he said proves me to be under the protection of some powerful person this sudden fortune the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me gold showered down upon me and the most splendid alliances about to be entered into   143.3739863639014
then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers   78.50311893665787
i am at home there   106.93143927442554
the affair in the rue saint jacques   232.91514151004833
he is one of cromwell s most enthusiastic disciples   79.06402202616074
it is my happiness my treasure my hope   123.42718136407119
to save yourselves to scamper away to flee that is good for the king s musketeers   224.27505090910427
she has been dead a year and you know fernand i have subsisted almost entirely on public charity   93.48782069277176
now jump down athos   75.89209918237783
gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings   134.72013586861465
the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances   101.21361380645256
i am mistaken   37.68046814414441
no your excellency   170.72599242398746
he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of starvation   82.8910389341903
the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five o clock in the morning   157.98063513577108
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden   114.14462996060301
asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance   140.17962055467976
and do you said valentine depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa   75.0766746326315
but we must say at the present moment d artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested   95.2541250766459
then it will be but charitable to inform him   134.05714705659568
i almost possess it   80.47398915000967
here edmond was to undergo another trial   118.35291351316678
ten parts of a hundred pistoles each in ten throws without revenge   132.6406351814098
a lieutenant in the corsican battalion   142.71419044277926
i can imagine the effect i do not see the means   2.70138862097933
we can die but once   134.60448730763605
that of the patrol going their rounds   114.62852938403289
but of what disease then did she die   50.43077519463402
brave athos   58.60820311266703
at the fourth the count knew what to expect   90.36893776531711
it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the jardin des plantes to la râpée   161.85256500131337
egad said d artagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren   110.64450689476516
all faithful hearts with me   122.15659779637387
marriage   136.0616146364255
morrel we shall see   107.64207481495446
say it my father   105.60794780761927
morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten   80.5445611914956
have you admired the rapidity of my fall   154.87487822691202
any other person would fail   106.52878035423383
the baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young officer   108.78741682197686
i think i know him   143.8249255778027
do you not remember him   130.6948409727345
but when you have drunk give me your opinion   133.0881264798368
i understand said monte cristo   109.73738622615954
all three have left the service   195.4438434391529
and let us burn this letter which no doubt announces to you some fresh infidelity of your grisette or your chambermaid   131.0010492810759
my horses said monte cristo   103.93282647448098
i give you absolute power therefore   115.920856335384
d artagnan glanced at the dinner service   136.9495764455558
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied   116.38516481088513
bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow but obeyed   113.6776884302311
now this is not all he said   62.86193384048319
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream   138.56255330542922
d artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided   108.25525370492733
they are compounded doubly strong   189.2391833379089
he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la rochelle   122.57512579636304
i believe in you and i would have all the merit of my devotion even if that devotion were stupidity   120.95913672762522
aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan who was saying to him you swear sir that it is not so   78.50274624833199
exclaimed d artagnan picking up a louis and displaying it   68.1958304635733
the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted   136.15562737473337
he is more than that replied château renaud   5.4250880095988805
no sir he is not with us   30.5237367513638
this box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the box   74.00043936608796
but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered   95.0044097283269
the king motioned him to accompany them   171.82018735610387
let us break the carriage   70.14784974131202
then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold   41.42028821153694
and the third the duke de longueville and the prince de conti brother and brother in law of condé   107.55640633627948
by jove i am falling or rather bayard is falling answered porthos   155.79580287769673
but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain   204.83054743261164
like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellow creatures   107.55555878921989
i should like it early as i am going into the country tomorrow   145.02455493371474
forget even my name and be happy   88.82520864155671
take planchet   126.82672158296579
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel   141.00938358184249
for one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect he threw himself on his father s neck   135.3501275222189
besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them with   48.26305523607029
god save the king   72.3586297595924
listen now to what i say in this my dying moment   111.23916788806311
really i think you are going mad good bertuccio said the count   72.68255565405344
well baron i promise you some good exercise   178.68083114839214
scarcely so much   96.64485195824628
promise me i say   82.60423214455463
i forget   175.70884170228064
many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room   108.44641329142686
then we set sail to night   98.22708190836936
in god s name answer me   97.19782328874012
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice   133.34620782502122
yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham   164.66502881552077
and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain   95.19465502218071
meanwhile kitty when we are about to separate and you are no longer jealous of me monsieur chevalier far off or near said kitty i shall always love you   86.4175440086239
that is to say athos will be chief engineer porthos purveyor in general and aramis governor of the fortress   45.70135681226057
cried mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands   135.709363393582
he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms   51.516298013275545
i have asked the headsman of bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief   81.95085359404503
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank   135.46611010157324
tell him all this for me for these are things which a king can not say for himself   112.68673550609863
this is tuesday well tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at tréport   128.04481396405717
that is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at us   106.2116486197048
and he went toward the door of the second compartment   120.85294066251973
and so aramis you are decidedly going into the church   63.89723369273005
shall i knock   56.900778159299044
so after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply la ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud   85.64253062554182
then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset   95.74473083662092
it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20 000 francs apiece for his horses   158.85792588750223
that it is only the pope who is infallible and that this infallibility does not extend to cardinals   120.26189251296371
who could ever have believed it   158.01733027504648
but we know very well what had become of edmond   28.887863534292705
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur   123.30920455601945
raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit   166.5462352374737
i will do without a promise and voluntarily all that i can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen   96.78359102994
well that has happened friend porthos   164.9851776983928
and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule   82.56818249293138
in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared   61.788874318153695
by him we obey   117.85597597241538
assemble the servants who remain there   39.122866819353035
no monseigneur no it is not he   131.32049224759797
what papers   88.32567071269216
oh that s simple enough   57.51186830293981
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock   142.62140256016264
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments   172.86480891693833
i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles   193.92379818938858
but this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him   98.48034749785165
oh this time it is too much   119.10381341371699
on entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was maitre bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished master   95.58655324414224
you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one   116.01990505439483
replied franz   97.96393558889623
monte cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerf s and then he passed into the small salon preceded by bertuccio who showed him the way   89.679454666943
that which i have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my lord   97.72777431145477
ah here is a private staircase said the count   139.79744783165245
and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so   113.06879210310854
travelling with his sister   157.37779012363058
it is too late said mazarin tearing his hair too late   192.2534307164885
why good god   79.28865189700515
you asked me the cause of my being late and why i come disguised   126.27210534662468
cried the calm voice of athos from the other side of the door let them just come in these devourers of little children and we shall see   90.72323875124226
at this time that is about half past twelve madame danglars ordered her carriage and went out   127.83105770445681
this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as possible whenever he met him or from asking in the kindest tone well monsieur cardinal how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor bernajoux of yours   88.86123555724306
did she stay long there   96.59788932615739
my prisoner   78.83188420808156
cried the sentinels   76.87970161240662
lord de winter thought athos was mad   52.49545438393064
always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart   154.39592950178871
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos   141.87733497095013
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey   68.44904647683919
morrel swore to love him with all his soul   157.6057516459701
is it my father   116.07224585408784
who is madame   154.78572234089404
her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband   106.61386929045284
in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers   178.03572846195405
aramis awoke   115.15367346457828
then you advise me to accept   116.55154122330288
he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace   114.76863520713384
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united   219.60015095535957
that we have as you well know good heaven   89.88800797026289
what doest thou here good for nothing   60.27427147038042
and if you wish for more said porthos putting his hand to his pocket thank you sir replied raoul blushing   207.34617002464472
you were recognized and the cardinal named you   145.03212775237353
anne of austria ran to her jewel case   119.89268804420381
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information   132.96301588984738
his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions   204.99831028778834
who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies   126.20389205926165
i don t suppose that our friend d artagnan has added any of his own to the amount   173.38460810616246
but he soon sighed for he passed before la réserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball   87.52977265089221
when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation   150.18865793877376
well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony   173.29314071129397
as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in   128.06539315571487
but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged   92.2959068933508
as long as they are in prison all will be well said anne but one of these days they will get out   138.4314255043345
where shall we pass the night   137.16262173119185
yes undoubtedly the abbé busoni himself replied monte cristo   58.300484316883214
the door closed and dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall   69.46823984276199
monsieur the abbé said he do you like blows with a cane   139.92523277546454
calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship   70.96082737784485
and how do you like my wine   156.16243042670442
i came to thank god for my happy deliverance said rochefort   154.6971080958435
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion   21.486430357148933
that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead   139.68314660983094
she only told me she wished to send me to london to serve the interests of an illustrious personage   150.49188968912128
the procureur exerted himself to reply   119.06337351223206
desideras diabolum unhappy man   171.6696798040207
do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars   106.80465689252358
i have no part to play   146.75203999813954
as long as your brother was with me he kept me up   98.682074955396
this feast is not very succulent   124.10712378548031
now as you are one of the whole world i mean to say that you also are deserting me   128.8223934190553
gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by lord de winter   130.37423869687456
and who was he   51.68333455148422
then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired   53.08790381584166
no replied madame danglars i am too ill   189.80685973440944
with you d artagnan with you porthos all four reunited for the first time for twenty years we would dare not only england but the three kingdoms put together   79.56555026775561
said andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls   129.18564572180716
at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard   84.31714539857339
d artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing   89.13891966680944
i hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else i warn you i will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion   176.4403818245031
a bark   215.31494255661602
three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre   143.27165508630105
it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him   97.05883551740038
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except monte cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence   131.60015830724436
an agreeable one   86.89443946895122
well monsieur laporte placed her near her majesty in order that our poor queen might at least have someone in whom she could place confidence abandoned as she is by the king watched as she is by the cardinal betrayed as she is by everybody   169.48241877288226
well i have ten thousand for you   161.323074713317
but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere   116.5158496295492
said porthos haughtily   169.37824033045405
he shall die then since you condemn him   129.94292319794852
traitors   98.30639846212424
the procurator s wife was piqued   142.35585414601215
in the regiment said d artagnan he is called porthos the queen started but his true name is the chevalier du vallon   90.76783292923663
and d artagnan coughed   74.67314188725238
at any rate said she since i am to be married whether i will or not i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with m   66.46758691148538
he is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and i will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service   166.76496055405883
she cried out but d avrigny paid no attention to her   164.03646552753304
she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear   81.4930774359823
have you any idea what became of them   103.49556660222422
la ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood   55.33881988719506
the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word   121.63197300513434
under the other cardinal continued d artagnan we didn t know enough to make our profits   96.59458137935181
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers   110.20450443188375
you know it must not   109.24038162245968
the wise man my child has said it is good to think of death   133.85273575994933
and as a far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored   71.34336730164524
there edmond dantès   164.57699049563706
monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation   66.07343085759564
cavalcanti something of the state of your finances   83.2635466846838
yes yes dantès good health   92.72582206866512
did i ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to marie de medici   57.56660793377567
ho friend   97.18382976650207
speak then   114.35163729697636
how well you reason   90.44905645215267
yes let us drink said athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with d artagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful country   130.16479159878023
that this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it   157.43518693081782
bah said beauchamp he played the prince very well   126.78009266932918
to be imprisoned   125.91931615376127
de tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as i have said i will do something for you young man   74.76459721785784
there said caderousse   110.43115110252134
the popular banker found that it answered better than count   105.05122342606472
he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons   114.87376002294938
when caderousse turned around he saw behind him la carconte paler and trembling more than ever   111.66411905025278
d artagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple on the contrary thanking his majesty greatly   159.42153323900413
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore   102.74362513629052
cried aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to   109.88671463557218
who prepared it   29.208229013397002
the horses started on a trot and took the road to the louvre which they entered   160.37864254853628
but can i continue to visit madame de chevreuse   116.91460911416715
never mind that returned the sailor i know their vessel   123.85551575297382
what has he done madame   138.85450716098472
we redouble our precautions   165.77630967363044
from whom comes this letter   122.34462847568862
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue   76.06568509223165
often   203.4524460878035
the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected   45.128923245259756
magnificent my dear fellow magnificent   59.40547005830251
the president paused and the count turned pale   45.56958466342091
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens   221.5053563401833
june   153.32539447723263
i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well more especially as i have news to give him that will improve his appetite   84.2653046523525
madame said he with dignity there will shortly be a ball at the hôtel de ville   24.537858123948624
do i for instance fare better   101.98420880907997
he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner   127.19684178148779
de tréville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal s arms   121.74146704947835
do you know whom i have encountered here   66.04856882858056
there is no prison here   87.18330471750502
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousin s with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required   64.08204858198982
tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with d artagnan and both soon arrived at athos s dwelling   136.89061303701936
i am not willing it should be known i have left the camp   130.2943725614784
au revoir   96.28990849497781
at length valentine ventured   129.8206099099849
she was his mother   102.9294909798324
chapter 89   114.87873512673939
the caves of the small island of monte cristo all i poss   115.63935354253262
you knew the poor lad then   134.21470753407002
milady held out her hand to him which he kissed tenderly   134.14321319629389
valentine seized the count s hand and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips   103.14891844558836
my dear monsieur de comminges said d artagnan you will find that my friend monsieur du vallon will go to the most fatal lengths if cardinal mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat   49.64876912318776
a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by morcerf   111.23494244453236
it is fernand the man whom after you edmond i love the best in the world   92.04783727369649
there could not possibly be any other difference between them   127.84723774842105
do i look so   52.91266614150442
and bowing to the lady he sprang into his saddle while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses   172.2209790467001
besides i shall be there   161.03541929664158
and all the sovereigns of the earth even cæsar borgia himself could not deprive me of this   213.9451427609646
although the musketeer was not expected before one o clock the procurator s wife had been on the watch ever since midday reckoning that the heart or perhaps the stomach of her lover would bring him before his time   113.05446563930056
and i know not what you mean said d artagnan bowing   77.19144592927685
god has so willed it   45.53586162816569
and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant journey   134.0026183885932
there is not a single woman passing   147.96544719231775
then i can speak without fear of tiring your excellency   173.50064631225604
sometimes their play degenerated into battles and in these battles the king was not always the stronger   70.45614869606504
now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself   129.39377343844396
what is it you want dear grandpapa   134.20638559023106
ah your pardon said dantès frowning in his turn   126.63765844166178
meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place   112.52378016872277
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne   103.25938536414158
i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek   152.51403767215598
well said the president   107.34310965779999
so so replied porthos   162.24349273563476
therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice   59.73077362711593
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity   62.76462591389564
but you were speaking of haitians   82.49839391089253
a pallor overspread the young man s forehead and he looked around him with anxiety   178.66947701050344
we shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting to morrow   146.99713223584976
40142m high walls   86.91053427846033
a great effect upon porthos who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood   77.20578420205925
said one   96.56361264026106
he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him   55.12154348204104
what the devil makes you think of bonacieux   92.88988807952435
and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother   182.55317528894471
the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work   123.87376819569154
cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants   174.89627453291178
listen said the doctor   13.93278954306389
she bore me rapidly away   47.57849212078415
cried friquet don t you see   226.9321029127931
and now monsieur d artagnan he said prepare to set off for saint germain and take a letter from me to the queen   87.4786217529547
that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen   146.2014236439761
but with his simple musketeer s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank   111.11057969411237
exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination   49.05890151624146
besides repentance becomes the guilty   147.50658681486408
but that happiness was denied me   160.59677352051844
said d artagnan this is rather warm   212.955837895804
all very well said porthos but i should like to understand   85.03133884830514
nor even ancient greek my dear count   37.25123919060873
i have learned some fine things concerning your musketeers   112.75913372749235
as these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their heads in sign of assent   121.04540866607324
and joy the surprise of seeing you so suddenly ah i feel as if i were going to die   99.30264589939726
you are not a priest you are a musketeer   122.68339284119249
everyone looked at carlini   80.4142262898359
this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal   68.06299904665173
he then took peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the carriage   102.46215473363154
and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face   0.5646328379866503
sell it then   62.8703720622883
he is i think the son of general d épinay   149.5591537426332
and even what i am sure of   193.821270622124
yes i am really he   183.1268435826407
but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me   107.50807579414163
then of his wife the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment   138.86731804146336
till now i have watched over his education and i have made him i hope an accomplished gentleman   138.91557823644814
a cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal   75.14346601121602
the phial contained perhaps twice as much more   80.66716528993413
the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence   85.11794640988039
his aim was to elude the examination   59.14218250181361
the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the château d if giving him all the time he desired for the examination while de boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper   103.67582903892948
the emperor now king of the petty island of elba after having held sovereign sway over one half of the world counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls after having been accustomed to hear the vive napoléons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings uttered in ten different languages was looked upon here as a ruined man separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne   146.19721742156602
for i always understood you were a bachelor   76.0823059243339
the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less   57.61454709188475
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him   166.69869899749764
but i know   110.9488863696796
for women have infallible instincts   8.672254708391378
i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone   90.68138197436562
i promised to come said felton and i have come   199.15662721099454
thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their companions   83.42850097511561
my pastry not good   150.37526313965256
oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any   97.3848074039667
morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars and which he attributed to his silence   94.02001298398473
capital isn t it   59.40257629922511
meanwhile if the count should come in will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me   106.08945993167212
the sergeant had not the courage to reply   130.43460556833412
the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued   125.5013146643199
is he much changed   157.74063236286332
at the cries of m   147.09703185847678
you see the address said the queen speaking so low that mme   156.663118016888
it will be even more difficult to descend   85.34694572863495
but return to your question   62.60884086381009
oh you ll know it someday aramis   144.04901281295338
the man or rather the ghost for he trod so softly that no sound was heard then poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it   109.14869156844371
35   55.17714480109918
we are observed   129.57976755194187
there was no answer and she continued i have not seen you all day   96.6178028899884
i almost hesitated though replied the sailor   135.1150711150371
from day to day he lived on alone and more and more solitary   59.66421173280238
what you do not know   60.262713712016634
anne said he you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease knowing that you can do it with impunity   97.38713217656203
and you will always love him   189.18548910916851
your little charge has not received the least injury   135.8746104650632
you have proved it   93.83862942321193
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers the soldier s throat   149.675744153343
when you are told anything can not be done there is an end of it   78.33255163833151
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden   105.52788362954622
albert left the cab in which he had come at the count s door intending to take a turn on foot   171.22715866849848
and i have no inclination to play   104.72348607638527
and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably not toward london where d artagnan and porthos believed they were going but to durham whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the tyne near newcastle   178.39126661224472
in the rue saint honore athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he was   124.8133908376555
debray you are a connoisseur i believe let me have your opinion upon them   197.21944510304456
your servants to whom i gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the inn   109.7041373067636
and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on you   122.55514598839639
exactly so said the delighted major   145.2942584780687
have pity on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself   168.83967082453688
we are admired i faith answered porthos   126.02025812343416
do i regret life   85.13539796266969
don t be afraid   44.255414589078086
the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket the major part of which arose from his winnings la vieuville said he take my place   37.724279341149014
this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu   153.10297495325375
besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum   147.8003161329751
then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance   62.57181773459499
and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her   185.95587990049313
the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty five or twenty six years of age   121.85522338385618
but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to forget   190.0618168825032
and you sing chorus replied guitant laughing   187.3911568800545
but what s the matter raoul   70.99345011907754
with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of amiens   128.14837033170036
the procureur   173.47992964933914
can i not like pasta malibran grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which i shall be indebted to no one but myself   108.10198621093669
you are going then to offer a prince are you   188.61215406570705
one night more and he would be on his way   114.23037762458311
she cried as d artagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason   97.82630088588553
i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse   168.2440226553749
but cried bonacieux this is not monsieur d artagnan whom you show me   117.49056682685121
and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of morrel were stifled in his throat   178.48173548866967
you here sir   106.09966901629352
they have been speaking of my marriage have they not   98.5059696078537
these names are too numerous for me to remember them all and i will content myself with the first said the queen graciously   153.61070670422663
d avrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips   100.92218350849913
order it as you please sire   134.90993690302972
one of the notaries sat down the other remained standing   91.88370382405583
and when is the wedding to be   131.02074129638942
porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience   106.05896949641664
talk only by gestures or rather always listen   188.23123859075832
de tréville or whether he should only ask him to give him carte blanche for some secret affair   99.31715508182764
but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow   158.10214151464788
an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave digger had found the object of his search   157.9316398029015
athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud my cousin my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them   129.9343750940805
de monte cristo is almost an oriental and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies   125.75071191579181
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti   111.83389155215322
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the table   87.877894533048
he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina   151.86712123762425
he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips   30.57677518617038
i will name you the lucretia of england   175.69276613320352
well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos   86.12798429334923
oh i resolved that it should take place as soon as possible   96.78217786268777
now attach him to our party   152.482859255936
you can not mean that   159.94919807878216
by the orders of the deputy procureur   176.33762276556155
men of the robe and men of the sword on the day after these events had taken place athos not having reappeared m   152.34609780500207
oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly   26.58313160557441
but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m   87.62636337957704
continued d artagnan   192.5219877540356
i confess this staggers me   163.32353401439212
he took the arm of madame danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found danglars taking coffee between the cavalcanti   95.01282500648867
but it appeared the servant did not find him   123.50090321421253
so you will say nothing   110.21701086087286
said monte cristo sighing   139.48179248870954
we shall pass an agreeable evening   53.777896257841554
yes replied de comminges more especially if it could reveal how monsieur d artagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him   129.81416062676664
added villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of justice   117.34732200109116
i have my full power   94.10949042485612
woman s yes   164.68499359061798
inquired the grave digger who was looking on   116.12093948033626
this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape   158.84290429804508
and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his 48 000 francs and the other 50 000 livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon   85.87419257339542
both were very handsome but of quite different styles of beauty   137.02241152944447
but where is my old friend winter   79.28230165587158
i have heard of it   196.86070831290436
yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone   128.52683516524726
hold just above that tree is the little spot where i thought i was killed   63.13659760894533
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day   189.7718618490491
but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which having no other name was called borgo   172.87558641154132
there was a profound silence   38.758774193339875
never had flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure   104.53686632249169
i confess i have seen nothing but the fire   95.00198873380222
you love   154.42271678299278
50101m do you wish to see him   227.20144795160934
to be a bishop   115.46522705635813
mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed sinbad the sailor   112.5002038359709
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men   67.34519884521197
he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land   119.97847042471258
and let him be no longer king cried the queen   109.72225211815211
they carried a banner on which could be read this strange device we are seeking our king   111.69603274946792
he found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound   166.19034146266347
stand off the road   25.167871098390506
but if i am not hungry   215.2896106058148
you know his father s name   111.54905325154213
i neither approve nor disapprove my lord   118.60948368611169
40130m no he wished to speak to your excellency   118.26426043479294
wonderfully said d artagnan   60.43692541519558
one of my brothers is about to die and i come to prepare him   136.50693111578988
oh sire what an idea   153.58280906809847
he let off his fire at but four paces   98.98831035304127
yes your purveyor godeau the purveyor of the musketeers   52.380572311435074
occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary   132.59425045137544
and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a prison   84.1823329958696
besides do you see that door athos   142.96210293184558
he therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill received   191.20180118778342
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count   205.64923993594485
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex   145.65389374461006
at least i have thought so   110.43781703711427
prove it to me   141.40423879734735
he is a cardinal likewise   48.98981998543587
behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames   53.96197792728042
why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered   170.1350937915043
nor me either said athos   98.47590745824472
i am but a poor friend to you   57.20034129385381
i am a daughter of earth i am a sister of thy faith that is all   34.97360519685158
asked raoul astonished   154.1694477833224
my mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my father s heart   24.574817127804664
in an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole hôtel was boiling   162.15000959102244
resumed porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good fellowship   103.20810917099207
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out   94.14444519809771
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal   113.19122700180326
ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less   179.63801088013994
like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of rubens   183.94089958390202
he lives at the end of the yard on the left on the third story   115.40126081589817
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth   177.66354715240482
open the gate he cried   139.65382256562526
each was accompanied by two priests   140.78491256890808
the nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them   81.39755750837976
the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day   133.2709400674466
i had designedly taken this direction   119.25676546392917
the charities present themselves to you through me   101.68765242326806
i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure   76.39138586086155
are you satisfied my lord   141.0551455114359
they told me that you were the man i wanted   116.80990277517944
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me   116.32721082092039
you condemned me to a horrible tedious death   95.0337024687953
louis at st   154.09751407683157
morrel was seated at his right hand danglars at his left   101.77023193095572
i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair   138.86790654994763
of how many persons   73.80311423585889
he then gave himself up to his happiness   4.886107882492681
in the course of his morning s walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted him   233.86967878450616
asked porthos in a self sufficient tone   56.513290043311784
ah that is something serious   103.92173576317302
oh those figures how well i remember them   83.83087474842512
you came from a country where he must be very much talked of and i know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal   131.28209761613934
and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the water   155.27503004034062
you will restore them to her majesty   144.9436713529515
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he can not without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money   40.783763446317295
but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles   80.99272821652798
one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened to you lord de winter had said to felton   108.569595580615
the staircase creaked he descended into the room below approached the fire and lit a candle   20.996764596454753
oh have pity have pity   109.95613832017658
i shall expect you   107.74474416795803
the duke came straight up to him and said monsieur de tréville his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hôtel   120.29821320709775
hush here is our man   106.03264652620653
d artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter   164.7918320355757
you might find it dull   97.27335544898392
de monte cristo king of china emperor of cochin china said the young imp looking slyly towards his sister   116.002530700812
a hundred   75.9858318482376
but listen to me valentine and i will tell you all about it   128.36314972747755
each of them took one which ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee   104.91946541399996
pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer   55.797077043558104
the face of the first was lost to parry in the darkness   126.47701632674485
before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm   145.0698881852133
we should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said aramis   124.29728538769493
but i m his cousin   70.22119465219467
where is the key you speak of   128.5032488102784
i hope so monsieur   126.18947514081945
because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation   115.66151180025582
well she must be at her country seat for she has not answered me   30.549097147584774
when shall we land in england   71.70140545107046
then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the traveler s abandoning his purse to save his life   160.14372511270787
he is ready to spring upon you beware   135.3784927275483
you are ill perhaps   65.74008913908222
he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming storm   103.52895983718915

i have provided for everything   90.70240658697928

at the same moment a well known voice above him pronounced these words colonel i want to speak to the people   132.63123488840972

the middle window at the café rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red cross   93.47555809823184

from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a horse   53.90524116600107
de villefort who lives in the faubourg saint honoré   12.575344540433889
and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortune brilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any   12.430945630016609

feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile   85.51681893887482
far from wishing my lord to quit paris i hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great statesman   85.01451087142789

exclaimed groslow   74.02745964509396
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step   111.39773516385462
the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth   146.93608008455115
the governor of the bastile was monsieur du tremblay the brother of the famous capuchin joseph that fearful favorite of richelieu s who went by the name of the gray cardinal   97.12562536556206
she was said to have a weak chest and like antonia in the cremona violin she would die one day while singing   174.7592942841107
the approach was not such as to prepossess people an ill smelling dark passage a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard   120.87159147307406
every one thronged around mademoiselle paulet for she was always very much the fashion   138.03745136678444
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction   130.4207120596971
that broussel shall be given up to them madame   143.11463910907023
but can he understand you   156.73246652114435
take away that fool   42.17555065796678
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop   143.92198992011302
two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to them   48.75648675498836
there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so la ramee when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss   157.79044941399349
he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary   94.1844909293019
yes saved saved   25.683416603836363
how did you manage to escape that scoundrel mazarin   156.88138400847564
i forgot there were three more steps before the landing   146.12282260619455
and his guardian what would he have said to that   136.44485109993502
you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words   33.48152196547457
this is what had taken place we have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner   111.60594215447935
but what if i were mistaken   183.8531429516139
the vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the coast   133.99697985415182
now said d artagnan i ve one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges   138.92413740529307
albert could not understand the banker s look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectly did you see said he how he looked at me   67.35233307911288
do think of it giulio   139.2556875108843
then said the abbess looking at milady with increasing interest i behold another poor victim   123.74243185554764
therefore he must have made 300 000 livres   90.08788807432643
and pray asked the baroness am i responsible for this loss   191.57032286040365
wholly yours aramis   110.22735158884862
i thank you for having recognized me sir   50.289372097999205
i thought i had crushed you madame   142.24748864061993
but i do   206.97505610837277
château renaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other   103.72045699841482
yet i think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your study   79.8960318656747
that did more honor to your heart than to your experience m   125.6451185353773
caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut   195.48196980931556
i held back his arm   141.13276861237125
an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation   167.43242014613568
his despair when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality   154.0899170371702
d artagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it   87.28017168186908
the carmelite convent at béthune chapter lxii   128.75228201083786
why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body   212.95956369202025
it is a magnificent charity   108.07773534093775
he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman s little finger   128.74644346516652
the two young men arose and entered the breakfast room   121.52926168903316
so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine   141.441006368643
our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valérien our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans   133.9432491557668
at that moment he cut it   163.4118100811087
my livery will be known replied porthos   148.77984075510335
according to the laws of dueling at that period d artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased   178.42477712012942
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step   117.9971398046789
gentlemen and citizens set me free   187.4467671131112
but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other   116.10354351154149
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead   99.77260097255896
think of your joy mother when you see me return with an embroidered uniform   113.50987526776623
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars   201.10152043975984
he soon felt that his ideas became again collected he could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning   111.24129761398027
all i can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season   99.49952551448384
i remained in the room and waited   212.6980546315185
between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover   145.39680084790203
i mean that m   128.97473231650017
god s blood   122.0138215558023
no said winter then he paused   129.54388020340497
selim made ready his lance   94.10991388708958
in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his speech   138.66191345155
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up   151.20206571375843
it was round and a large divan completely encircled it   117.04513786317617
on this assurance the two friends fell asleep   77.53200812549076
swear to nothing   159.39577819005464
still that idea of death madame said villefort   154.74102284619937
i own that this woman terrifies me   127.454862159483
come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as that   55.935122519799286
monsieur de nargonne was a baron and my name is hermine   129.16645054753172
and the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and mademoiselle d armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through   104.16241505258216
never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope   190.34565759303018
your mission is accomplished but ours is not   126.12394538191748
no i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of pascal and the house of wild turner of marseilles amounting to nearly 55 000 francs   121.98721284720294
you will not pardon me   194.3347518725535
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way   65.70080195566567
rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads   142.26139317035398
eugénie danglars   167.0352882258254
you will accept his judgment   53.39199524842806
milady recoiled uttering a cry   23.955334747004002
the noise increased   45.20923848852158
i do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather   169.4670286974585
ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied franz which will make it still more difficult   116.3005686534031
d artagnan s eyes sparkled with joy   10.448059815417409
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel   126.87810889645573
at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king   157.74620436208153
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money   27.862951428840987
but i thoroughly hate but a few   70.92480786325916
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at d artagnan who was counting on his fingers   144.37971502509473
his dialect amuses me   83.27082875616185
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor   143.07696258937062
i see them about twenty paces behind my lord   145.23431483577866
do you wish to see me again   73.78803623071974
said de winter i am at this moment as poor as he is if not poorer   53.20125389843691
that it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a revolt   111.59908475666847
d artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many   151.09436802790609
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir   110.2540817210418
oh may god keep me from it and you too   100.45974839035205
remarked d artagnan   158.09612281683758
he took his army to the priest s where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornet s who performed wonders   149.82762108503124
there he told the chief all his affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins   83.97393191129635
with much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you   67.65387053433483
danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured   158.86267633697298
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind   71.46568799805291
on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped   69.0931731886867
the past chapter 114   218.59636143046936
and now am i to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror   157.91368185701708
then leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly   140.45272387002836
let us go said athos and aramis   177.01017947241291
it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours   40.01299481436419
leave him with me replied the duchess   86.02454628643507
four o clock   82.38664729483193
that is not his biggest scoop said morcerf   167.0249582843503
one of the last as you see   137.54576463101833
gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of baron danglars are two that belong exclusively to me a pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in paris   67.93012354807041
i have not breathed a syllable to them   104.91377013624542
so that since that time replied d artagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host   110.48455871478747
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning   93.87087635127224
he consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded man   85.53002740125909
danglars wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenant general which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chaussée d antin   74.72647706682457
i have induced you to take a charming promenade   114.68526922496088
but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son   145.17796425636482
when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life   157.40985979575314
felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified   190.9854828125928
but go on i beg of you   170.82702209030003
50265m give way said the traveller   108.15650728855171
and he gazed with terror on rita pale and bloody a knife buried in her bosom   157.82745637192232
the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni   160.56630091638206
i will come directly cried valentine aloud   76.98526186337756
if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death   92.38278179634683
i must speak freely to her accuse myself and say he approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his hand   135.3173220227098
another nod on the part of grimaud   192.2291438738716
d artagnan felt himself bewildered   129.34145202476685
both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking   127.52996314592343
he might perhaps have been bought for less   112.06554376988457
cried porthos and aramis   67.68335605385158
all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle   126.83768898682843
the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds   173.461661637406
my faith yes said d artagnan   134.5322494072421
yes cried bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes that s it   90.52837473006976
with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while kitty pushed the bolts   77.80664197931443
cried d artagnan to the coachman   86.73697556016093
i take them said d artagnan for myself   50.34332935494119
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison   81.82928649757457
you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything   126.89948643242327
you buried my child alive   117.46477441033397
he swam on still and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness   163.0579206205099
because as i have told you it has to do with a great queen   100.98989211251536
the two young men shuddered for the same idea had more than once occurred to them   135.4195836113202
i do not feel remorse because that woman i profoundly hold deserved her punishment   105.620260651098
go away now mouston   181.81843560795915
d artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning fever   103.69351521638143
but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him   129.96310269290797
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket   24.831891187133593
you will take your musketoon and your pistols   145.77315147220628
madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the halle six at the corner of the rue de l arbre sec and two at the door of your palace fifteen in all   139.01980831122398
you may retire   107.35762739133743
no on the contrary we shall not answer   130.5812580000513
the penalty of death i greatly fear   110.67657563644927
i dislike these quarrels among men of the church   147.25965455662276
retorted the count   148.74786248199112
if these are spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought d artagnan we shall yet be able to do business together   61.223106100987465
night   136.57018053019155
nay nay   92.26050254170805
gaspard   150.4173856264198
not at all said château renaud slowly   132.71889819976042
but d artagnan was too far off to hear him   25.673211815596048
he took her for the queen   108.52647287163569
but in this world we must risk something   179.11526658964632
yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit   76.75900965374987
meaning to say replied dantès with a smile which but ill concealed his trouble that if i were not a captain eh eh   229.78106945110082
chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor   116.12313913962696
the young princess clapped her hands   118.75233301415695
but you who must know that i am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will   111.09248307151063
it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dantès with the passage which united them   138.41711628793738
at least not at this moment for without you i could not discover the others   86.69220453413423
i agree with you entirely sir   164.01575995905364
to be sure why not   68.90562675667152
again danglars bit his lips   46.251371774024975
mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first   116.31662134000713
you are somewhat blasé i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others   105.19439190171906
ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldn t surprise me at all   125.8340225271194
i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of second rate fortunes   166.3953733533294
here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment   127.66773861963779
after giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me   176.7562915155968
mount my lord said d artagnan to mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding   174.780706574757
that is to say she was in the full splendor of her beauty   151.2704498017372
ah valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles   103.48175529944533
in the first place i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find it   62.23009238218413
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself   153.79552283280725
he can turn his coat inside out   99.09988515864714
sir she said to morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master   166.76269139257073
he shall do what he wishes to do   99.83221544067543
the notes reminded the men that the children women and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons their wives and their fathers and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions   140.40307952424715
this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m   137.29390285814122
have you by any chance been in the bastile   195.7824617723088
my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified d hozier and jaucourt   152.39503714379072
but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness   47.39120656393665
he is going to fall   187.37071492337017
ah said villefort smiling i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me   64.12201193153355
who was your brother   166.52075135190086
you will hear me to the end my lord   90.12105389311378
and for pirates returned gaetano repeating franz s words   81.48881819488808
from his eminence cardinal mazarin presenting a letter   115.63167361735817
major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti announced baptistin   158.28077855565624
this man goes to give his last orders   70.73399008679033
valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear   106.07595107351514
i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky   79.30540728562963
you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning interrupted mordaunt   82.24471278878727
thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history   74.60156384461902
now kiss me   144.8894986141618
but who after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world now i fondly hope watches from her home in heaven   136.0666075015073
i have never seen her from that day   99.56469411573708
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue   71.05097019008306
sir what a cook must monsieur pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating and drinking even whilst he was only called monsieur porthos   101.10496469691086
de villefort altered his intention   79.45788354621175
they begin to morrow   118.71435871358395
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm   108.54048622337386
the good captain leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of m   151.01627494827213
presently said d artagnan   50.35525555376549
debray who has not trembled before me   131.29001651949787
how exquisitely coselli sings his part   126.4735135042099
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle   103.80545767279894
and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti   90.7411996268379
well it is the same with hashish   83.34086278688349
nothing the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions   120.1745824721753
why was i a prisoner   119.95662478126228
see that cluster of persons collected around poor ali who is as much astonished as themselves   135.34263856361167
but be of good cheer   86.75254222280559
require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness   168.35096078457155
porthos we slept six years side by side   103.71226345958326
and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles villefort was introduced   121.21374854801279
let us go   129.67070482241365
poor kitty hoped to speak a few words to d artagnan when he passed through her chamber   84.14476075268013
god preserved me but a man named brisemont died in my place   81.3485754010903
in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new born child   121.23698534176596
when she wakes she can sup   156.87624798261825
meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape   68.18870813939547
like all persons of real genius milady knew what suited her nature and her means   74.27869226924707
why does she love what we hate most in the world the spaniards and the english   58.53030918350608
don t stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet   133.94479927231848
so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it   221.1902285113606
the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times   113.94053968436093
every one was impatient la ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape   49.06945215435793
and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own   116.48354201645645
but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror   85.23219850462065
amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the panes   104.6689041206666
he felt afraid of hearing his own history   164.8540172668575
say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army   97.90123404383738
for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to lord de winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queen s carriage had left the court   47.33960811072549
upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie   136.5694929071632
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step   80.68851878905102
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed   27.02607169618264
about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one   93.11457052399035
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance   69.05804905479688
what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics   108.37296563088793
de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st   196.22549811744443
i have already told you my lord that i shall see no one   172.55576221242723
be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most advantages   34.53795971871999
a horse for your lackey   132.99955206182764
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions   72.23725851144314
his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his three cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons   75.72709656340976
it was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket   140.80859305386346
only one minute mr   52.26856732682154
but for me who am without any settled means and without resources for me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet   189.99581201791187
the young man bowed   115.56507762727809
where can we find another sword   101.69314140206525
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment   41.860046487912925
ah good evening my dear m   101.14100858755097
oh how beautiful you are thus   172.78339262579468
he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip himself   133.00985116646095
then you came here to defend him   117.1599995154884
cried mousqueton reddening with joy   111.48539552772087
that is true said the duke   35.22068209708624
you don t know i quit the seminary   106.71232259737116
it is the talk of all paris   143.67740166644208
and monsieur du vallon added the other   102.6457978727676
well he shall live   144.04973526380334
gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast   83.88492405561138
my time is not my own   75.5523250702783
ah that is true said de guiche   74.41763902436492
the second contained the duke and duchess of orleans the tall young mademoiselle and the abbé de la riviere   161.2089423875448
cried dantès eagerly quitting the table   174.3896577873506
i neither know nor wish to know him   167.7952296070726
d artagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queen s presence   171.79399714260995
he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons   70.78945731263224
but you come from england   48.32737820388432
and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me   95.89947458046576
there s no second constance in the world   140.6898816372684
i came to pray over the body of your daughter   131.06055468252188
i have told you   99.71027856373979
do you want me to go away   157.46774437110165
i present them   139.5434513323182
the last   99.82473271393107
de chevreuse   135.27974656333848
yes monsieur i believe so   128.37540772642936
instantly   114.61185101758387
you are here   158.7968593984909
i am under his orders for the next month   144.4642190397505
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day   159.57585042000957
monseigneur replied porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not safe   199.72832449963784
why the idea of taking quarters with senor perez seems to me very reasonable and for my part i agree to it   92.79795768965914
cried d artagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell who s an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman   96.7997871728092
and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined   36.38069917789471
cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital   100.79738698685446
what she threatens she will do   84.40183478046457
emmanuel received him   44.58945757610621
monte cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep   58.309705720523375
he having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in vain   131.19995891843885
what hatred she distills   113.79973423989486
the bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor ship owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources   134.70254510144622
hence it resulted when d artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard   159.38635813810566
i have read so in petronius said the count   164.87796857475422
go into my study here and i will show it to you   134.74841137315497
taste the hashish guest of mine taste the hashish   144.01393566223132
last year i had four apricots they stole one i had one nectarine only one well sir they ate half of it on the wall   40.92186784291496
felton arose   157.81044584494956
i depend on you   88.60662289067007
the dog again shook his head as if to say no   73.22141934289039
i have but you in the world haydée   79.66830424350599
i understand said athos   36.62414785190485
he had reserved from his annuity his family papers his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary   147.05979332174599
but i see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel   73.24459183073861
till we meet again then dear traitor   50.21812258624148
i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics   150.3219074860628
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king   123.43470278254071
you oh heaven you   159.10433301281785
mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queen like grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on raoul   92.22507911182913
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart   22.475965397924284
that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited   71.05160212501923
let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it   109.94087056919436
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect   111.16425821664431
from the time d artagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twenty five or twenty six years old had been singularly interested in him   170.2475094081119
and as i was about to say by the word of bonacieux i have confidence in you   141.061646897249
it is bad bad bad   132.28596589891418
his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love   163.19192313175347
arrived and was the bearer of the duke s dying gift to the queen   171.85324657491856
what do you think of the plan gentlemen   127.92565404631432
no my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just now   111.02024313845095
i saw the soldier s shape and the top of his musket   94.35350141571321
while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone   106.82197797408992
so saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage   132.20075103787985
i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor   40.87954344341546
mademoiselle eugénie   137.84832573498466
and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the light   130.24015414682736
but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly   124.1757742016423
said morrel in a hoarse voice   124.4895521598857
let her go free and i will exact nothing else from you   117.54379673694972
shall you not go with the queen   46.839587092126834
said morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator   111.88198349911185
thanks replied the jeweller   90.92242561748328
and so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some anjou wine   101.6721642101513
cromwell had two or three of these retreats in london unknown except to the most intimate of his friends   85.22208635513027
what is the matter my dear m   111.22277203308202
by my soul you had made me forget all that dear constance   156.69008278028642
on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailor but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès   99.7740347788435
he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance and that he could no longer say god is for and with me   83.42759546816231
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others   133.1574383741037
most certainly but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant this dear child and myself must both have perished   134.23569185932237
because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow so   133.4064300610271
money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require   91.03445440083058
the duke is english   98.3700998381713
she continued when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier   61.157155173563936
do you return to paris   77.78056427219906
at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade   76.34664473877571
my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk   63.32248210672044
but since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison   50.8108981285764
how do you feel this morning   182.19561171003073
you say we are going to see athos now and if you will come thither i beg you to make haste for we have lost much time already   152.03031994057136
the young men had no objection to this proposition   164.0252799920894
excuse me madame said debray coldly i had your permission to do so and i have made use of it   211.99807748667826
the journey monte cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together   137.61870652572097
but the real adieux were made in mme   81.32163630664353
asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to understand   114.84353819358819
it appears that after having challenged m   132.89584009988448
at these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea   125.10617365166793
she advanced some steps towards the staircase and listened   123.14295697354488
but never mind i will put up with it for the sake of remaining with you   70.32140533455892
but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply   80.88651895538676
of latude from the bastille   109.16464343260108
no matter replied de boville in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs no matter i can fancy it   125.2589265918835
he seems besotted said danglars pushing caderousse with his knee   108.30308038027391
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces   211.9140662255733
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend   171.93366343806815
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table   94.96539842060612
the door soon opened and the accused appeared   62.343468450793885
i am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead   43.72737703344771
whether noirtier understood the young man s indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him   183.85791582232557
silence be silent   51.76968574699582
delirium   129.5709195070398
she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists   102.57409572691705
what reason   138.2492940210514
in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles   100.22099847673212
well what would you have me do   161.90975664751193
and he lives   136.00697732377537
but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dantès i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end   78.0187277265502
i felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in spanish from the enemy s ranks i closed my eyes and thought of you   13.035248485329674
on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to faria s dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen   113.77282429057986
it was   62.98740501129712
the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed   92.54148468445159
alas you will find it so yourself said aramis with a sigh   159.365606739472
if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied   76.6244756540535
he is he would have added edmond dantès but the count seized his arm and prevented him   35.86464077840216
if mousqueton were with us observed athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this   129.14606930127712
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us   135.87856905131505
said the cardinal knitting his brow   154.25989426817725
the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion   33.80940947494037
you have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them   107.61115579632963
it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you   120.35701570474653
madame de villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange preliminaries   120.11269705741269
turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm   127.18874093269615
everything is best in its time monseigneur   59.01707434621925
gascon headed man will you have done   109.23295704294281
then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living   138.55815583800933
yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis   75.01148343332734
i hope soon to see you again my dear edmond   28.008977347894415
many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people   75.75035792583937
valentine cast down her eyes   119.79484608183422
the trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped   125.60840978816304
go and fetch it my good fellow   162.01264316071718
upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone   124.4432406236983
franz paused for a moment   106.50128226018629
so that now continued caderousse he owns a magnificent house no   160.77466447381832
dantès had entered the château d if with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past   76.96298897415444
where he is going to visit athos   62.67859647229939
then you will be besieged   70.37735255248398
i said without your laying out a sou   168.29529684648045
farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror   85.52766665931964
on recognizing her step mother valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the bed   213.85749563286646
and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light   27.1558275501052
supposing also i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per cent   127.69928952137077
swear it upon the cross   177.93099739123494
my brother is reading his two papers la presse and les débats within six steps of her   230.2769409284001
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise   91.53809071472173
today is thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday   127.29152783044715
i know it sir replied monte cristo   102.9717332180767
we every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork and some meat when he asks for it   133.98499509431605
where you please returned monte cristo since i know nothing at all of it   154.4700411802726
it was precisely at this moment that m   166.16396799744084
it was almost broad daylight   213.18928198718584
yes much said d artagnan who did not well know how to answer   110.55654829586732
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes   109.5492988522174
allow it to die tranquilly and honorably of old age and if you make a campaign with it take as much care of it as you would of an old servant   168.1371547793885
you will know presently pass it   106.44540845096599
they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for them a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party   123.0834811010001
as danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your highness   102.7247163006887
it was now athos who turned pale   114.44699336512198
poor young man   164.04431109712
oh madame do not think that   23.986835341172224
they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate   110.08838586454962
d artagnan seized the hand held out to him and kissed it ardently   27.87744197072324
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts   147.44513514848592
raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful   10.190637773523434
danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300 000 francs in a day   96.62259789361866
oh you do not mean that said he   96.99676878185764
this time you have an idea   46.33199744449297
and is it your cook who prepares these pills   190.86853786641223
monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person   85.45816319940712
yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief   184.46298279491108
yes have you a plan   102.62011633013904
the ninny   46.37714504398568
but meanwhile continued m   41.03861453308481
my father s income is about 50 000 francs per annum   116.0790390730549
rising and retreating to the very wall   143.55372036060777
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her   128.05694433889622
you here at this hour   148.72080910624445
do not forsake me   164.53442743307411
oh yes my friend   181.23702051485623
is that all then   51.77440020943796
but is not your eminence going to the queen   27.56694220229444
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family   135.92483609315622
near her was mademoiselle louise d armilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy which she intended immediately to make use of   179.59325515089367
at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened   87.59763083896527
and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh   109.55883051856442
think you it was the poor servant s life was coveted   157.60295875214877
monsieur de gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret   159.0460723952147
i will describe my captivity   142.01155912992553
the most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans bless with holy water sprinklers which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers   151.42469731092814
nine tenths of the english people are horrified at what you say   108.05126166592223
i shall have nothing to fear but robbers   115.0460956147578
this was too much for the procurator s wife   145.6227086848269
there and elsewhere   36.849019439022456
mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries down with mazarin and pleased with gondy s suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have   133.5361089534655
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face   158.25921118664877
observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order   76.87339593504477
at length the shutter closed   82.77114192293317
from the comte de la fere said aramis   177.67764212615106
certainly sir   109.16547073117707
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment a conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation   69.67762813375217
a great pity said monte cristo   65.66880100056386
it would be a curious idea and maybe i should find my friend under the name of achilles   134.50749171794155
yes you know the amount   135.07418124137325
the rendezvous chapter xxiv   186.06182459046073
fie madame fie   2.8130350003584397
the thieves had already approached andrea some screaming la savate la savate   108.84395120501671
to what do you allude monsieur   150.18440726126323
come just acknowledge that i could eh   171.56656791765184
in honest truth raoul   107.22168289709407
nevertheless the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not rogers who stood before them   174.89460166177406
the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la réserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar   93.58659270663915
villefort went himself to find her   64.71932505980192
i should like to have seen you in my place   117.67155385071361
the hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence   185.1739282908353
i shall do so if only in gratitude eh   98.1365615528324
satan bowed his head and groaned   197.74950158059357
the count praised bertuccio s zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month   168.1909264701977
ah i shall know how to make you leave your home   138.44235203759763
lost beyond redemption   49.91859076270515
it is like that turkish phrase of molière s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance   143.319818576109
have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for i may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when i in my turn may require your aid and influence   101.15932348020833
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard   70.82922596447058
my lord cried the queen you forget that i have never said that i love you   170.5450147003063
your brother   160.28037527878007
i give you my word of a gentleman   155.49952995015474
what think you of it   132.19696182642988
danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon   122.20650708537633
the three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look   54.08551132023505
as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the luxembourg   177.77081393238157
said porthos raising himself in his bed   88.79598701290467
the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed   188.55864036276438
here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel   114.1983513712277
he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth   83.58111399028924
the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table   120.80108131700293
now asked porthos what are we to do   111.0308670497439
dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment   154.94998611762674
embrace also our good and brave porthos   95.15484089923694
aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of athos   48.96245137981508
a week passed by   56.27587458932773
but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday   89.317680808682
d avrigny warned me of it   116.71713703059393
leave the rest to me   87.44673968514792
that s very kind of him   214.31762092712876
40196m yes was the unanimous answer   149.48438795754186
he was at least forty   124.75981966807231
peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most men who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion   108.41082376440671
franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air   178.08266832362474
it depends on you only   174.19422808900194
no matter i was aware of his intention   136.15060517970312
this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage drive   62.256707011611084
but i will tell you   163.339488796871
said madame danglars signing   120.66198897122783
two other clocks slower than that of saint philippe du roule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent   116.93279133228768
you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son   123.93162236228532
now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it   78.5173694604274
adieu mademoiselle   84.15918593595173
three of the four horses had already arrived   116.40694483771007
good day m   79.63907080577788
and i give you absolution beforehand   132.8426818776886
come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel   144.7132393754144
to me to a brother   191.63406664104082
de tréville and ran quickly up the stairs   138.83341416496523
d artagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier   92.63782921629122
it was then nearly eight o clock in the evening   271.13332817677457
at last he heard the voice of la ramee   134.7187419013275
there is the wounded man said de guiche passing close to the augustine brother   100.72067520850311
remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympathies   23.191210713986592
it was simply yet richly furnished   116.76276102694011
the house at auteuil chapter 44   110.76109638588224
long live blancmesnil   128.81934625643785
he went on his way   70.87590668765182
said louise looking at her with admiration   130.7542318098845
he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m   163.57856008559207
thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model   57.19921348944427
be assured of that   92.95630242510143
not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile   156.87913496220503
your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to you   80.35785029274265
but did you think there was anything particular in his look   60.73825112039239
nothing could be better done   130.94872430127845
20081m oh they are simple enough replied the host   98.44653458584163
replied the marquis let us lose no time then   177.12324171025094
is it not tempting what i offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only to do thus   218.67064368471466
yes i have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me   126.82603511835498
then i must give up the idea   147.34067121729024
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush   195.24975227261615
said he on perceiving d artagnan   95.14390300623178
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman   104.75362637589612
speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend   125.40534250247009
to that i can say nothing returned d artagnan who knew the vanity of the new baron   66.83910080158154
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady   106.48601143694486
but you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus   165.23235615954036
in three hours and a half andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compiègne and four o clock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop   162.84449845081073
i have a party at my house tonight and therefore can not possibly remain till the end of the opera   161.79522332498698
but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets   122.42094867684011
the more reason you should fire the first   55.20137339526858
all were still   130.76048995576073
morrel advanced towards beauchamp and château renaud who seeing his intention came to meet him   121.05271431607105
if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino   86.52930706671981

well my lord said la ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them   190.1075624670019
said milady in an anxious tone   147.16249684921326
which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the englishman   140.65730997179855
i do not speak for him but for myself   157.0394433826985
the scheme is well known said the inspector   59.9804303030865

he dreamed that he was endowed with wings he wished to fly away   115.52727497795735
but the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his eminence   86.8276350997947
each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy   127.11289315065518
he must have one said athos   117.36695950618754
well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal   190.6079344391729
upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of affair   132.51514025889355
you can not think so dear love   167.96438223795096
the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back   149.6926276594383
it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing   162.3690251205517
from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise   105.70258329101776
in that case i will go   207.0034971045254

but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek   92.90321037587867
d avrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning   124.83807700677465
half an hour after the night was quite dark   105.7951172881549
he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a tree   61.57615145777964
the mendicant continued to rip his garments   132.8073274467317
so that he still expects his money   215.57548124934067
you know he always has wise advice to give   160.2469524310892
in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock   165.78282168156275

but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre   125.03164156309887
it is too much to ask   103.95055930541993
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo   115.68102072543242

edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps   42.4108517018193
and what is it to you   203.1343535010746

but if they say it must be to me am i no longer king   168.07096376617636

you must be aware that i was ignorant of that madame   82.15443628223099

de villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and caderousse   76.16466471156672
their own m   150.96958932772213
a nurse of the doctor s choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven o clock when valentine was asleep   135.8923580727125
at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed   137.99200887357003
then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out   121.11948327396027
the minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal   71.80197673518398
duke said flamarens you forget that to morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the queen   94.2107917687676
noirtier had stated   74.26860512695154
said d artagnan pressing her hand still more warmly   121.20266736618504
he then rose and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness   159.9014862619444
to the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silence unbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above   110.68684049336105
i think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment   63.225474048643534
i believe i know m   91.5995806032921
it is indeed   171.61518053849127
but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know i have taken orders   130.466148854804
you see the cardinal is about to make the next campaign helm on head and partisan in hand   167.28863853439486
the young girl hastily took the letter from him   28.383445401343366
my dear friend if i am you must not laugh at me for being so   71.180183530887
an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me   44.939799942328364
scoundrel   134.30906388193443
only as the question now is not of rank but of quarters you know the custom come and seek for yours   63.78454029669694
then you never believed in the principality   145.1295745849057
said kitty for whom have i exposed myself to all that   230.01706332212336
the three gentlemen then shook hands lord de winter taking the rue saint honore and athos and aramis remaining together   63.3031359371092
that s useless said d artagnan   127.63041370969773
i believe so at least   76.5114505516748
d artagnan obeyed   83.99016034362235
the servant drew back and said if you wish to go alone sir i will go and tell my mistress   128.0844920965707
then as they had been accustomed to do they had recourse to m   180.2184376062678
i was told there were such at the last exhibition   99.40565518899099
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note   88.69817887267482
there is only mademoiselle eugénie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me   92.62184638462136
that pretty little soubrette whom d artagnan had already observed then came in   148.79669737581338
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinal s cap   144.68664496951146
exclaimed he turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the host who came in to inquire if he was unhurt   38.496477303308836
the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor   124.87330314352475
i saw her   153.07339191185378
i should be ashamed for anyone to know your baseness   154.8798938361893
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m   92.35687909858038
d artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army   69.56628733293948
live yourself your mother and sister with the most rigid economy so that from day to day the property of those whom i leave in your hands may augment and fructify   84.9508014237537
at precisely six o clock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door   116.54340071019597
it seems you must always be playing some game or other   82.73741766486171
and it will be even a disadvantage to you   160.6412042141897
the note burned the hand of d artagnan   102.34237756791232
maximilian said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles   65.73582150793254
40094m what has he done to you   158.64120053209197
then up the rhine to strasbourg   131.26692535674712
it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england   197.33292292455792
and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everything you are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven   103.19873002642068
we should command an annuity of 175 000 livres   41.63798130374283
valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it   148.86522094636013
chapter xli   43.90078565998445
i do not retreat mordieu   84.17288388355229
danglars is his banker is he not   62.57359166195399
murmured she courage   81.04152014903792
the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera   113.47687512032296
he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world   161.6549519108992
i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you as i do   123.50515763717617
here in an hour   180.76506195498678
from that time he received all who came   162.56218777223833
this noirtier was his father   135.9940860556403
do you wish me to speak the truth   91.8497997611551
franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them   225.91114126880365
tis possible   85.0910287732113
and acting upon this principle the banker s daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise d armilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company   106.82937475881965
we are going with some ceremony   111.29430863637018
he belongs to the fronde and you to the queen of england   143.62134379735082
excuse the remark   142.70825312753541
at present i shall appear to sell myself   91.56172369018559
you are sure of your enterprise   159.02693866202145
the man standing before you valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of   90.71164178366533
it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will   32.302954762201864
the four lackeys guarded the door and the window   61.465973012377766
he was charged to tell the comte de la fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations   90.90027252693629
but the ink said dantès   126.55365649450377
i was brought up here   202.41529373135336
your excellency it is done already   162.2424076712652
well thought of porthos   40.924603732292965
the conviction that they came from m   82.18373734866086
benedetto will be punished   159.78727025450496
when i am insulted i do not faint   217.72216309646006
oh make yourself easy   157.11993722052512
it was a mixed mass of blue red and gold   51.58341607302379
the communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you and which does you honor   153.7564218146148
was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task   165.12537962833153
what have you done with monsieur de bruy   56.60920736034589
he turned a deaf ear and contented himself with laughing and between two parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword here cried he parodying a verse of the bible here will bicarat die   100.97874351080168
she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir   63.72640157099369
why have you not done so   138.99080273049347
athos was scarcely aged at all   108.87832832588884
the second because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring if possible to fathom those of this woman   66.91214195188196
i am sure my dear albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious   129.9332146547176
alas i look around me in vain   112.22715080149283
de tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes   91.64526959749739
accomplish the orders of lord de winter said felton with a gloomy smile   57.8042604508022
but once again that gentleman where is he   65.94803362644095
at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards   91.51262101039168
bah you are wrong   148.56477988542414
i became angry   62.77938293643457
mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror   141.04504165185725
return on sunday   153.79189733971782
it was the marquis de saint méran   156.48659235555175
he can always be found as tréville says   75.09862305013291
however fugitive this homicide flash felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this woman s heart   23.926053367142316
and what is it saying anything you understand   43.57936813775714
i don t know him   170.39171963960518
i confess i can discover no other safe and satisfactory way   102.03371615461009
this time kitty was nowhere waiting for him   177.6263469938635
they are like a great child who only wants humoring   121.9282061293676
i do not tell you this madame to terrify you   112.93081413502674
oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian   119.46184005673746
unfortunately i didn t crush him flat   127.07185094937964
d épinay that during my life time my father s will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained   161.12222510940148
but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired look well among my uncle s papers   97.5842613442307
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino   106.18097754659598
it was therefore on the footing of friends that d artagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois   132.78003665249375
the baroness clasped her hands   84.53003814884327
the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs   194.17068912404423
the stranger had written to lord wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten o clock   126.37679020716847
an old man decorated with the cross of saint louis now rose and proposed the health of king louis xviii   113.6020960509485
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truth   70.54988655606552
because i am he who saved your father s life when he wished to destroy himself as you do today because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the pharaon to old morrel because i am the edmond dantès who nursed you a child on my knees   157.97516141187475
exclaimed aramis   98.84358457487492
with your lasso you could stop an ox   59.902160047364255
he will sully it then returned lucien   157.7124553416532
who told you i was there   119.88580473944901
d artagnan passed a very bad night   137.80550217486487
it will be nothing more than a sign from m   62.86848428681814
give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned dantès   110.1028814027806
that is just what i find fault with   126.26922105368851
noirtier made a sign that she was to do so   149.32704371818863
in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow   56.78158111120463
at least nothing in good earnest   47.36652456323408
if we choose replied danglars he will remain what he is   186.4659635357973
on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph   41.53232010301532
the price of his blood   139.3609766670665
valentine hid her head between her hands   142.4830570246037
you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hands going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me   114.03107381062262
there she must always be   85.52052434962926
chapter lxxiii   135.43917250308297
as usual this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company who hastened to the succor of their comrades   145.17671518987942
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way   83.78065515417103
you are right said felton after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her   81.57924150577281
and i said planchet with dignity i know them and i answer for them   202.8366545476556
i am hungry feed me   50.66667613792163
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour   56.64708123210373
a difficult commission my lord replied d artagnan resuming his serious manner   52.26311085345131
he then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the left   93.50126313090618
but if i accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place   184.75196671048752
the other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato   76.78600318696436
one hundred thousand francs repeated peppino   116.63202725638646
cried he striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong   170.2500217389789
but amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme   171.73169697299068
let us go count   25.457887017825385
stop an idea   70.64537955958482
an hour passed during which dantès excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the waves   73.74160756201915
he was alone alone with these countless these unheard of treasures   100.98851784447832
in the midst of this seeming hilarity nevertheless people s minds were uneasy   132.05868527148903
danglars dined here   74.45560204368249
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting   117.99921669989739
then pretending to see raoul for the first time ah   141.62587426848395
i was born for a diplomatist   122.92534816124042
but in heaven s name do not expose yourself to danger   242.5857925390693
d artagnan believed this cough to be a signal   146.97305223619875
our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna   47.237234962443594
to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen   116.34612709287296
when i think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe   121.35058020892215
your bills at least are the first that will fall due   135.97864873130894
they have killed them i think and taken flight carrying off their booty   141.68088471128632
but all the italians are the same   138.4733961515392
we know the count s vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man   107.55483315223324
i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer   54.40903019581371
we can not see your signs   73.94171030896453
he was crazy   117.34768569972559
i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and i pray you to do so also   92.26848654439804
yes said andrea   181.22922069442623
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away   157.76863006570866
have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours   99.95918499932753
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it   158.5391927068265
therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem   76.12452251132609
and you think you can catch him   76.67450197567409
pardon me said d artagnan   72.12729856806942
once upon a time there lived a queen a powerful monarch who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe   54.993832825283405
it is kept by a friend of ours   81.61811203344854
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor   223.23865910972688
he had his foot upon it that is all   92.50410463867432
in what branch   82.83578522191635
well pursued caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs   72.48211535979848
it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly   189.46345863105694
an hour had elapsed since her condemnation   57.36359504881182
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety   190.7263537471161
that is to say of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom beginning with the king   82.96495654023104
an h and an n surmounted by a baron s coronet   138.41580923267537
let s fly the feather before the wind   187.5682975057764
i do not remember if it is exactly 48 000 francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference   140.9761438490123
he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling   156.47175528270256
a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible   73.87301681212594
for i have the proofs   60.14181951080222
monsieur franz is his friend you know   116.45649471724069
it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it   105.53669527800693
those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country   158.03105255581474
nevertheless i confess i still doubt   127.72709954981045
whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching   156.28026171521964
beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas   186.57912790260468
d artagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out   116.93422430972251
are you not going to put up at the arms of england   45.388778661354735
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth   151.44032541176605
my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful   33.077636493578
the reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it   75.17484721871793
rochefort recognized the voice   86.68128828469622
at last i mastered my agitation   63.12556023397712
to which do you belong   48.62570809358243
danglars appeared   65.79477948343123
i will not die alone i will not   202.0665206411519
one day you will be able to understand how all this is   93.79105573362233
d artagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber   116.55401332670006
i regard them as invaluable   79.29168694569542
that s agreed   194.0414460390126
in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him   69.51233559568198
for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to mazarin as every gentleman ought to be   173.31913076392584
anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it   33.80113323414976
yes i am aware you may go alone since i once met you in italy but to accompany the mysterious monte cristo   132.72426417230122
do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison   164.52074585416887
i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you   110.80004236740331
you at marseilles   185.37890575240442
and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters   133.87198483751894
do you know that monsieur   99.3069815406982
to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de méré or a vitry   169.20407511469023
i did i promise you anything my lord   40.97213091513916
is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself   198.64578089264532
come answered mazarin i see it will be necessary for me to capitulate   98.40186743730024
asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments   86.70127946010896
a thousand pistoles perhaps   138.32799106476327
come come signor pastrini no joking   71.91606985793227
a strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city   51.74630076965758
at two o clock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of monsieur de tréville   128.31411606433306
you may now retire   143.9556461967829
he did not dare to write for fear of not being able to such experienced eyes as those of milady to disguise his writing sufficiently   135.70720095150278
i was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained   79.99216774693804
nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows   66.5557824647282
i believe you said mme   99.10986846178419
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dantès repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word   62.40008222204682
now to supper said aramis   54.43411493840323
planchet was sent for and instructions were given him   155.1191975106693
yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end i wish to attain i mean the remission of my sins   80.28166155966827
send the case before the judges   68.13691976897864
can tréville have set this gascon upon me   171.8630252352246
you were too young to know about such things   135.3907707876217
you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my lord has authorized you to look into her bed   42.07748590997869
tomorrow monsieur   160.82472682497874
the some one is coming   39.894171511121684
and have those who have lost their lives lost nothing   136.9325591957066
but where and when shall i see you again   113.13909162170128
the fact is mademoiselle said barrois i am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me i can not say i should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it   156.99798404092576
we are no longer in the middle ages   118.24838806477193
noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir   143.57910355420438
did you not say something of an infant   104.13930209219644
what sized man is he   176.4666792646151
look here resumed d artagnan   80.5355629838202
i will obey your orders my lord   41.68238820783935
d artagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends   80.37117392646064
to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at   97.86591137729793
monte cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his heart   95.40090264665712
i know not where i have left my hat and in all probability i should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me   120.56303339984127
sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them   145.59804017192445
i won t go unless you give me the album said the boy seating himself doggedly in an armchair according to his habit of never giving way   92.39654320053455
repeated buckingham   139.39673946808136
he has then charged me to take it from you   48.7053088616492
de rieux was inclined to do likewise but i told him they wouldn t look for us where we were   135.1202854541715
major cavalcanti both the count and baptistin had told the truth when they announced to morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served monte cristo as a pretext for declining albert s invitation   85.97820244730082
yes perfectly well intimately even   179.56581726092375
here is debray who detests you without reading you so he says   191.4391818254469
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection   55.33872578270139
chevalier d herblay   120.29475194170172
noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentine s hand   168.52610326378053
he is a miser   163.18868466415915
but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity   108.89981620979243
then he has not returned   183.54170671244339
and she left the room   124.45839138294454
but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint méran despised all who were not noble   97.15426325464122
an old acquaintance replied grimaud   84.1941466193424
a lover s deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive   46.09426652955956
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots   172.46672219453927
ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty   40.18047368504031
prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father   153.14903036800496
i am i am no   178.02894721227793
then i have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees   148.5818553946897
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended   133.86769377218013
i m not such a rhinoceros as you are   115.34962250288807
it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill   108.89509976520735
it need not be said that d artagnan was still thinking of the husband   78.8768074315582
with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it   80.63840863765556
but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that m   185.90293363926915
you can restore it to his family said d artagnan   75.52014851573142
at this movement which nobody opposed he resumed a little courage and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other   72.00163360598374
i have been nearly mad   124.93070454123554
i did not like to say so answered dantès smiling   124.18557895115809
up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice   178.94559859208948
you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom   74.41444618721385
40268m the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition   125.55329387765784
the idea that tomorrow i shall no longer suffer is sweet to my heart   180.5364584958328
an instant after the count entered   135.97767738222743
d artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge   129.19039883316728
well then why it does not much concern us do you think it does   130.63038131810262
and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added caderousse with his unpleasant smile   215.64667342389242
well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword   104.84838978319007
at auteuil near paris   266.43318374220337
and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised   91.36840737902061
still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partner s murmurs and lamentations   121.16763550606419
and see here it is said the count   119.76975170322297
20301m our expedition made a favorable beginning   125.16933201564379
that is doubtless our boat said athos   132.54206563143885
the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea   104.9121758418864
i should find myself therefore more at my ease facilius natans in a subject of my own choice which would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to metaphysics in philosophy   143.97623841427944
you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping chamber   154.7414166454571
i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here   72.18102904449735
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood   16.881397702118633
then they embraced   78.0428422799718
at the voice of this last speaker grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow   119.05782276382256
i beg your excellency s pardon interposed the steward in a deprecating manner for venturing to observe that it is already two o clock   107.32825394709107
but he seemed to me cold   106.73431090613795
alas said andrea sighing one can not be completely happy in this world   88.95673821239888
and believe me monsieur coadjutor the court will give from fear what it will not give from good will   195.62952950425205
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread   97.68625571795789
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table   122.4183475662645
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half open door and told his master that the horses were ready   163.3149055182149
for in that case i shall demand of his majesty permission to plead for him   190.73121658060742
your engagement was for breakfast then   111.12113595635715
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things   116.7291446729527
in reply i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich   129.94815160134544
he was nay probably may still be a bonapartist and is called noirtier   168.63063884615764
is there indeed my good fellow   83.02702814339409
unruly comminges smiled   59.016435755279105
or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be   60.2949000846312
have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself   208.63654626974403
the man who lives to see shall see   29.032044289717476
0039m ah yes continued caderousse and capital offers too   129.32188132377883
really athos you would make a singular general   164.55739412797422
napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans   161.9493446567884
and now eat and drink   174.57593007797848
and i too exclaimed porthos   143.92227427621404
the coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting on the jours maigres on account of my health   72.97501039231327
the whole world conspires to break our bonds   145.8498423627828
he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled   194.92503968564134
barrois made some steps towards his master   134.52659994509264
and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom   162.96102318107285
leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret   165.55637521591157
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him   150.56709267424876
from m   78.78130872052334
aramis and his thesis chapter xxvii   214.25579249870765
the brother did not perceive this   35.24711638797781
ah said the count i see that m   227.5768189639052
what diabolical villainy you have performed here said porthos when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone   151.36767512168373
and he gave me reason to hope that at paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince   106.4601985507443
a man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services   89.69795112824988
bertuccio remained standing before him   107.83528792838014
this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow   238.24118705036295
but listen   87.94484902075206
this was fulfilling the intentions of monsieur porthos who had desired us to be so careful of this letter was it not   138.37252663868614
explain yourself mousqueton   226.7826504174484
i am at quite a loss how to answer you i admit said mme   104.75497524394814
his countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principles a wicked nature subdued by determination perhaps by repentance   88.50104058344265
oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years i have felt the least approach to joy or hope   177.93816115978223
ah that said the prince i understand that language thoroughly   144.24451691969506
we have so many means of gaining information   148.68295932591192
besides by the faith of bonacieux you call yourself bonacieux   133.29312935141513
i hasten to comply with your excellencies wishes   155.82646412243642
but that must be a princess at least that lady with her negro boy and her maid   87.87446813085559
we shall require no arms   146.66007147026204
of the great cardinal   77.68571295289547
said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration   110.04748384773978
morrel relaxed his hold of valentine and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain   130.7858327874666
i hate him   193.9266876955562
he understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to rome   110.01272082613463
how do you make that out   128.53844007822786
i wish i could say as much for i do conceal myself   123.9335336586845
beauchamp and it is always well done   211.71136891008723
cried the wretch falling on her knees   124.91938429566044
he guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurator s wife of the rue aux ours which was the more probable from the church of st   102.31188708623299
i give you my oath that i will not   35.48296702806569
five minutes after it was down   171.05891420840013
at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited   105.76441738274781
persons whom i do not like   92.62300232886868
you are right madame said the king and i am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me   42.16181370876927
as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse   98.09612543812108
you are going to leave us   72.32312271244103
scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son s room and inquired from laporte if the king was in bed   86.23135457367131
preceded by ali who carried a rose colored flambeau in his hand the young lady who was no other than the lovely greek who had been monte cristo s companion in italy was conducted to her apartments while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself   15.280120888908883
two gentlemen   188.2903834174518
so many dreadful things have happened to me lately that i am on the verge of madness   179.32308237269208
i am frightful tonight she said   95.96416771506622
but you have seen him   117.50166428341741
make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield   164.5142407947516
d avrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind   181.40843806919358
but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade   115.00237396234718
that s because they don t see us said athos   194.4625931315956
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes   164.24874755382092
franz de quesnel baron d épinay   144.3860686697346
de chevreuse and mme   103.77678417894508
when he was quite a child and only a shepherd i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arms   75.46803938557986
this fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon   0.003360651789293456
you must give your recipe to planchet   63.521502158801965
that you may be sure said the gascon means something   112.22123800724233
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence   51.47379145141923
however he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night   144.35225304349945
albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when morrel seized his hand while beauchamp and château renaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back   101.89458860863846
now after what you told me this morning of your heart i may believe well count replied morrel gayly i will not dispute it   101.13914174379929
fool that i was   71.33561266622877
so be it i will erect an altar deo ignoto   14.80683797889867
in truth said athos aramis is right   101.04178813021058
the lieutenant of musketeers   166.61731980168327
in the first place monsieur athos is arrested   149.04365106682235
certainly said morcerf   127.01409379311961
said the host bewildered   170.3031608386825
0289m chapter 23   106.76196015868926
yes you wished to speak to me   61.65659009862727
it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest whispers of ambition counsels of selfishness   116.98655294438633
the infernal demons   105.99519033648465
i will live   134.63433370162505
these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young man s death would be placed to the account of the enemy   91.90825888529534
yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity   59.911842854234415
but he was stopped short and he stood with his body a little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched hand   113.96320989158771
now i repeat my father is named m   177.6077430437346
athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door   155.11221109001397
you knew it   148.2938911638908
what is the matter monsieur   143.32496430736356
and seeing them dantès sighed heavily   105.19130890822498
god sends me this and i hail it joyfully   113.45877787699908
and he levelled his carbine at dantès who felt the muzzle against his temple   164.42831887359256
he shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments   160.74047596934412
tell us about it   77.99500879750474
was killed   110.99387451460271
repeated porthos   81.58318585711794
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose   178.50542176978297
hear me said he   124.05014474628693
so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality   172.45760109813804
tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you   144.5090485340188
the four muskets made but one report but four men fell   135.89104506386016
they both went into the house   39.03213083620483
oh added a third voice the shrouds of the château d if are not dear   133.67279534087345
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said albert   152.62545132141622
yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and i have performed the commission that you gave me   97.7688872201645
monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly you see i was praying   63.11085562775045
i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else   75.05300922784426
when you please monsieur said athos putting himself on guard   177.596400594015
said he to the host who advanced to greet him   125.0888216398361
caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories but also cross the court   148.01278650635481
bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive   99.8264445421769
then after having led monte cristo around the little garden he returned to the house   72.64004370232104
a smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen   198.6843770000276
ask my beloved sister haydée who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day while talking to me of you   112.86906493671702
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men   162.1274259886468
but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish   87.356716655609
now where are you going   185.91854667008607
yourself   170.30268951827162
he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours   127.76914259080516
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting   106.53473203445687
as if there was not another house at auteuil than that of the assassination   100.19741692243204
ah that is my affair   119.750467437457
on the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in front   139.44458356016034
the duke more and more bewildered let grimaud loose and took the note   122.56357220726224
but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers   178.31693905418507
how can a young man live upon 5 000 francs a month   116.5471129882747
debray told me apropos what has become of him   80.00810821274683
the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking   154.24808746371477
discipline is the same for them as for everybody else   141.64317445335976
remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue   72.89079208261569
was it an entire army   52.98004766345429
40108m i promised him to wait replied morrel   95.74118159196175
but on our way to the piazza del popolo i wish to pass through the corso   48.0287132869766
thank you said the young man   178.96155777487604
but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs élysées or by the faubourg saint honoré   129.6770774577011
now pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for madame de montbazon   241.29959986210767
upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman   109.55389476712176
the abbé uttered a kind of groan   49.49457771390253
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience   115.13843569920758
the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river   114.69323308030935
i am alone said the abbé and i will again have pity on you and will let you escape at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to if you tell me the truth   119.74900056930632
still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness   162.65553320617465
well porthos follow my examples   151.91801082144474
he will never guess what all this means   58.27562497540786
you mentioned my name then aloud   138.08567548918708
behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation   131.82112640255858
but he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers carlini was killed   145.51936377032249
and the major gave a letter into the young man s hand   165.6686145956023
the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre   28.080139137181618
it was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand   103.99813336598996
and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters   110.15442244227731
you pardon me   145.2923610098934
cried friquet suffocating   113.06166950233519
you see i am generous am i not mother   109.13854555676483
de morcerf and is justified by his son   103.51906414029787
he was charming   175.23952257313607
then you really lost by that affair in spain   95.89091914614663
never to leave the prisoner alone   113.46154629913802
the third of my friends although my rival was much attached to me his name was fernand   119.76026986799613
noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed   107.53992515554063
and i would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice or even three times than they should be misunderstood   128.02370491089843
sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword   90.5191583975827
i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my merit   77.96208452098465
at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker   73.92928994693253
you were saying my dear friend no   6.405202710338273
i agree to athos s plan   194.86435691102457
then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends   93.70596805684326
and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them   114.41487243109862
i make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me   127.07421134859781
a few hundred yards beyond the town d artagnan drew rein   109.86891510621919
hop in and we re off   144.86021204560984
so you refuse my request   96.71682951221496
but if your body be not greatly benefited by it be assured your soul will   157.8999235239886
then you don t know me sir   117.46844899795568
ah you are his son   235.0773131369245
let us part good friends   154.83017041073975
is everyone here your excellency   167.1603536716717
will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men they will carry you ashore   51.6049816581191
have you not yet divined who he is   152.91156586202968
cavalcanti said andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father   76.14481493167375
i dreamed that i saw you lying bleeding wounded   166.5749149706853
the sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening   110.49870640213707
twenty good pistoles already without reckoning the doctor   65.71686717971747
she gave it to him at once   112.89589728801825
you know bragelonne said athos i never speak without reflection   154.46749321448854
break his arm wound him but do not kill him   95.48654062582807
for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me   150.86180785716044
ah indeed said d artagnan   70.52842880629831
not all   91.56627717510719
the marshal   190.35958216238657
the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand put his lips to it and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine he spat the liquor into the fireplace   129.05188584383276
parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened   51.34105485976526
now since the affair of nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses   77.96367615795305
goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand   113.57473610847094
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me   115.10770895627341
well tempter what more do you want with me   113.1756980400867
sir replied monte cristo coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs   76.28199208059223
if we have no news of them this evening to morrow we must start   80.05343103262314
athos after making sure that lord winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said come aramis now for the honor of france   97.22267577041605
come he said to himself let me try if he will be more tractable than the other   155.06986788475615
go on monsieur bertuccio said the count   95.90606966288877
i could defy a nation   96.34473041035464
he was softened   188.69945406684258
even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at d artagnan with an air of reproach   121.7738595273094
the president read mr   108.50291590507338
but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood   78.52355720104404
no i am pleased so pleased that i wished to congratulate you   207.02161769154694
tell me what i am to do for this   103.88231727005521
as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and i picked up a million from which 250 000 francs were paid to you for pin money   190.83194432391213
just now before i came down to you i drank a glass of sugared water   83.5510015657008
he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet   72.99320745445686
and of what did he die   89.37997135975112
as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great   123.03668403739984
finally farmer louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and thirty   172.38805156155212
gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late   94.31222703780043
and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors   75.14139176815985
when my father with a pistol in his hand was once on the point of committing suicide had anyone then said this man deserves his misery would not that person have been deceived   80.37085344777503
we are well mounted are we not porthos   89.58262439329005
and i also have reflected   98.87435536560622
the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner   131.99427046696414
do you mean at rome   153.44815605448542
should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are saved   147.5306110035609
besides i am a picard   155.92567923257832
but replied the owner glancing after dantès who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone   137.7406124672112
since we are recalling names let us remember them all   151.14085842015209
but as la jeune amélie had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to leghorn   153.91759869188837
he would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life   145.90029074742816
i have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other   29.273107948380172
but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening   91.89033869456044
it s for some purpose rely on it   27.6043297112178
exclaimed d artagnan putting his finger on his lips   124.94002921635558
he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch   133.4314837747889
arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high road   98.19353288550244
monte cristo turned to haydée and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in greek πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖν that is tell us the fate of your father   18.968852503970197
and he hastily quitted the apartment   122.97859849598198
the priest stole the sacred vases and sold them   130.87426072811064
repeated mme   97.99676794200931
de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin   26.383508885822792
i fear it is a conspiracy   100.12088183180008
this letter was in milady s handwriting   194.76199816033636
oh how feverish you are   191.2544042309272
we chased him for six hours and when he was near being taken when st   179.20328625793456
but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner   103.45589162969253
he had stopped like raoul at the hotel of the bell and bottle the best at compiegne   77.94773114751354
vaguely   157.03770482180585
capricious and unfaithful the king wished to be called louis the just and louis the chaste   113.56805239773533
no try this hare which i had killed yesterday in one of my warrens   199.37473428789934
you may remain   115.67878561204401
repeated morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness   105.51211768890605
but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand   104.52833481146635
where is this lemonade   150.29161337964092
but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her   143.77218221110513
the moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano can not be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment   8.326935445740276
you are quite decided then to leave it   136.3601446111375
italy sinbad the sailor towards the beginning of the year 1838 two young men belonging to the first society of paris the viscount albert de morcerf and the baron franz d épinay were at florence   137.66731852765
and andrea continued his plan   177.00499870575896
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear   94.07323479157455
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion   166.6225856194377
but these monks are subject to such degrading practices   137.60680065222283
i believe the storm is over said he   63.799518278831975
anne of austria lowered her head allowed the torrent to flow on without replying hoping that it would cease of itself   119.00003165883655
her lips were cold   100.47534800010932
and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss   153.45397410633052
that was his favorite word   33.56357531583025
go on said the abbé   128.32448366277228
why here is the simple fact   84.00415157765107
it was about half past nine   133.93994239123919
if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire can not be seen from the side or from pianosa but only from the sea   85.98937362908678
and i imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon her that i had imprinted upon my poor brother   49.14501152124406
then a voice reached them once more sending this threat to our next meeting sirs in england   214.19378667837637
faith no for between the culprit and the victim i have no choice   131.97826807755135
where is athos   132.18041641377667
and matches   122.73595516276582
oh cried the novice as to friends you would have them wherever you want you appear so good and are so beautiful   26.923495633005658
for he said nothing and did much   149.2918051480848
perhaps he may   93.43627475237558
that is true monsieur you are well informed   112.40015475120971
good thought he   97.58714340197454
i shall replied d artagnan and instantly   166.2512430428855
another   90.39627369128702
and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them   66.70297628374989
yes yes said athos   43.349651549253664
i know too that you are a good marksman there we are about equal   112.37915898012189
if there were any danger to be apprehended on the road i am going i would request you to accompany me   113.98371257428875
i come therefore to ask what has become of him   61.230565075930734
the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count   153.6532800223439
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still   84.4831521263504
he received thirty sous per day and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch and affable toward his master   81.43408785761459
muttered athos i may be mistaken i haven t the unerring eye of d artagnan   112.80842189679863
and therefore i said were our object money only   179.12392363933807
oh juxon said the king seizing the bishop s two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety   124.74600610672972
athos on quitting aramis went to madame de chevreuse   139.8701618360208
but the latter went on without pity seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence   123.1924829235566
you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight   135.71328637210067
go and promote digestion by working said the procurator gravely   169.32357586559755
so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth   156.8234425032361
d artagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m   126.88636079102831
bravo said maximilian   109.80075045741812
but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it   228.2914546089143
but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination   194.10976418461303
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhône   181.46681803585398
ten minutes later the curate of st   140.1905995984226
take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor   121.40630960180107
had entertained toward mazarin and he endeavored to receive the minister s homage with civility   88.03629241347973
king s attorney   85.87476255215681
we dress the king in groslow s clothes   203.97464773498848
and i believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which i take my name   189.19321949650322
but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth   134.05586784717593
but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience   183.63636727833222
the vicomte de bragelonne who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty is the friend of my son who owes to him his life   177.67379128679423
it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman   1.8390614733436053
hold on   145.94929331615717
the youth looked pleased   81.55918916195625
look at the comte de la fere a type of nobility a flower of chivalry   79.24480748111716
one plays with anybody   127.17685942781588
how long has he been there   115.50900988880466
the thirty two that we shall use tonight are its progeny   175.50971165033658
and where is she then   59.76939220271372
oh i am sure of it   75.16002115450337
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said porthos   89.88098299345478
no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now   179.81738044362172
i am at your service sir said the abbé with a marked italian accent   110.13986425797657
planchet yes i have found him again but he is lackey no longer   117.32019526036724
i doubt it   146.2685960275965
because having neither arms nor password we shouldn t take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel   95.96794697678158
why yourself to be sure   88.66190185345073
it must be aramis   38.06641947803497
beware morcerf he is already an old man   91.17243130873405
no your excellency returned bertuccio   62.86423691409027
bonacieux in an undertone   85.73772054845665
the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat   73.10393081277296
yes sir a fearful misfortune   137.1270036222775
however you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the tent   94.51829127535419
but still you acted from motives of self interest my dear maximilian for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us   84.86168755759998
the way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of puritan congratulations   120.97745398398922
but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations   158.47340536906572
the blade was round and of flexible silver   95.48107726239537
at seven o clock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled   165.0024110339678
your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired   195.03145980576522
he again   225.84692589688305
really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success   48.931116923668
but where can i wait   123.4391990233608
dividing the proceeds chapter 107   44.215095213800566
i am sorry i did not follow him said porthos   79.94831880256353
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here   107.4400437258973
perhaps said anne   99.8650765672508
felton reappeared and without observing whether milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready spread   20.39488008694576
and he knows the full casks said blaisois for he has already been in the hold with monsieur le chevalier d artagnan   95.58951858720832
i have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts   185.66387981918103
whispered caderousse you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played   104.17673588764505
cried groslow rushing to the hatchway   122.5790516017585
returned the count   64.64401600320106
what are you doing here   104.95175565930614
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do   141.868670913335
be careful   110.30806073962056
and he named several distinguished gentlemen and among them was m   82.62525975637908
at ferrara tasso s prison   123.07952963689763
and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me   88.56387256734789
though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead   36.05568457007993
we will explain in a few words how d artagnan had been led to choose that place of residence   120.81923931733483
the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the ante rooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop s palace   188.001712519522
those who have died of hunger   132.69272279246343
as to groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from d artagnan what he had lost to porthos and on leaving reminded the gascon of his appointment   91.40180510340525
i was not praying   127.85536130721374
but i confess to you i am now almost exhausted   161.4273276944581
from th abyss he ll give ear to my moan   132.20773876951438
for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvre all which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it   160.6768656366799
willingly   117.03740165994533
exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan   85.88328557237536
so much the worse so much the worse diavolo   48.55603673590407
the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering   55.306974747067116
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together   101.65965713096612
edward cried m   106.43969006248383
cried monte cristo stopping suddenly what words do you utter   63.99976576772282
the second was the man s conventional abode or rather sleeping place   76.7142419747444
midnight sounded and almost at the same time the bell was rung in milady s chamber   101.51551378212766
when franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon   78.20001832563753
occasionally he shuddered   164.2464188554213
because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired   64.46835488989075
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp   71.91052196923994
bills upon his majesty s private treasury answered d artagnan who reckoning upon entering into the king s service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood   65.51952988299902
his deep set eyes were hollow and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face   161.81253783471266
lift it and judge if i am mistaken   54.14010421337838
athos listened to him without a frown   96.39950144114407
20029m as to the note which accompanied this the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dantès situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt   213.39188817343
he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors   116.31079130742167
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment   39.80116521388564
this man named emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he was superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated   77.50419259813695
danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated   112.24771670458642
morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding   86.91484584552049
are you not a christian   51.054853505803635
i wish to be there i expect to get something by it   78.16584239174655
he is in safe custody answered villefort   97.87545114972572
40190m these words restored albert   151.82763670079385
i was trying said porthos to recall where i had seen that mendicant whom i must have killed   98.96377091130478
i have seen milady   141.1369763371198
ought we to go on   125.7839466664164
in the french or turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling   232.61965441995028
it concerns your treasures does it not   106.27593724078616
lord winter is killed then   104.32291029046638
fifty feet   200.41279982839194
i am lost said he   202.57091284495522
after dinner the count of monte cristo was announced   208.9303898904741
one by one the several groups broke up   87.01936543097332
on whom   20.97077040053732
de tréville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress   81.61857943372223
the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden   165.5048376506463
said lord de winter with contempt   173.53043900487532
indeed i expected it for it is a family inheritance   55.94872757316353
you will see said the man proudly   179.23479943612153
if i guess rightly will you confess it   63.60701448453466
be it so said athos   51.80119971009198
well but what does that matter   62.802886736977015
cried the duke opening the door of the chapel patrick   65.96466376619526
your wound   104.85569302376254
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes   145.11777912893376
resumed mme   97.6162219914997
come speak my worthy corsican speak   80.265442377952
this chancellor was a pleasant man   123.65168532538067
i have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator jean moquet   175.2101571661317
no said d artagnan and yet i am certain it is not the first time i have seen that visage   165.95963501133656
against whom   28.080569403154
we are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires   123.57261325331632
the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass   145.9206014716175
no vampire cried beauchamp   112.5307279347393
he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face   189.994408954953
if perchance m   46.81672200369316
he may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck   123.67697147730837
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of albert s eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat   117.07582332588183
i tell you what i have been told   130.51273030264304
he knows her brother in law   110.78597371400724
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle s saddle bow   94.35914813488655
tell me valentine for it is that i came to know   96.90545290338706
athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind him   213.79719164690903
he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a musketeer apprentice   104.12110426909693
at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade   119.36991736644639
i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or man s countenance is no longer to be relied on   65.86682790374968
and so dantès after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven   184.33795720332853
it was faria s last winding sheet a winding sheet which as the turnkey said cost so little   103.2866871485756
and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me   61.445031162707956
her wrists were bruised   127.23552079915203
the bride blushed while fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow   145.80947805166576
a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five and twenty years of exile   52.27136967558911
this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing a make up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of geniality and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill temper   44.102156828615676
but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison   86.54011399901432
then as they were just passing the round tower the young man shouted stand by there to lower the topsails and jib   161.90686104812738
no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount   31.182899281300948
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris   158.0985828771403
i offer my best respects and services to you my lord   199.59308005206478
albert de morcerf or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man   152.12162736349788
mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place   73.77008160166862
and as we are in haste to rejoin the prince s army we must continue our journey   34.08927722251883
but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope   105.76071560760019
continued m   132.58166325732677
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity   99.09636575396792
come aramis   75.7058297207547
let us be open with each other   102.48927009092799
then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment   214.96536610594913
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity   192.81755785201173
doctor i resist no longer i can no longer defend myself i believe you   190.21299962801632
i swear to you again rather than betray you i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces   108.17435297259613
ah that s all very fine retorted the woman   61.42975334223035
cromwell turned as he was going   17.89312205449899
it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo   143.42765125031931
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him   80.25890540306844
he is beforehand with us said m   179.14891227022113
i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew   147.9619545020235
the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m   56.98875754586145
danglars do you not maximilian the banker whose horses ran away with my stepmother and little brother and very nearly killed them   77.80146522763012
d artagnan said the minister sitting down i am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer   92.69549732201286
i need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money   26.998929238179542
cried buckingham   128.01691007183013
and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them   83.79820283991107
said he what is this   132.0214623024468
it proves that we know how to keep our secrets   43.52006824560594
none at all   44.106560875892086
rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his button hole   130.64994298178212
but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four o clock to fetch him from the rospoli palace   96.41845761973752
i do not go on because it pleases me to stop here   38.41146476508919
but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances   115.77213642266007
and milady stretched out her arms to mme   174.6032557223116
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him   220.8545218603387
resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host good night and mounted the stairs   94.77802342314563
asked the comte   108.07040556630145
but she is dead and my duty regards the living   73.57279022733586
the coadjutor bowed   138.9216762185714
add another day for landing and that would make four   185.10627844995147
meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following day the day appointed by the judges   97.18396684359698
ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy   61.99863081507397
madame said lucien playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a friend of the house expected to be caressed i am not the only one who makes similar complaints i think i heard morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed   123.13302967113388
said caderousse twirling a plate in the air between his two hands   37.179815333998036
he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma the one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery   185.58368772572987
he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night   156.33208431599928
the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door   97.8616857296213
let him signal   75.60450389727471
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned   166.91152033179623
it has four hundred lines and lasts a minute   174.551923966724
lord de winter went out making a sign to felton who followed him shutting the door after him   99.25520037032665
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette   90.9832013210074
but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste   102.04052841586171
and you know the axiom non bis in idem   170.00017027392087
we have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her majesty   121.13010077790177
he had married a woman from the village of carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village   102.08404578104589
milady was in it   81.6654141962205
i recognize you perfectly   81.68657683683307
you know my devotion to you   159.72617131782738
the jailer advanced   128.87336782866947
read that he said   154.07219051328124
and i madame   94.55403706676555
did he receive you ungraciously my dear friend   117.59056809098466
the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended   148.05748175067203
the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music   32.592287386067326
you are mad dear friend   117.55390514805055
i speak of monsieur de tréville who was formerly my neighbor and who had the honor to be as a child the play fellow of our king louis xiii   138.82857035933108
she made him kill the duke   184.57041591624585
and what did you do with that letter   115.49646986888106
that we couldn t go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves   157.93404940553086
she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of d artagnan and even gave him her hand to kiss   106.36332994828949
monsieur d artagnan belongs to the service   104.44799973441607
in which the plot thickens his visit to m   168.06880086547858
the consequence is that when i saw our laborers which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours i had recourse to a little of my old trade   148.65681971287424
stay with grandpapa maximilian   117.18187724156539
d artagnan was over him at a bound and said to the englishman pointing his sword to his throat i could kill you my lord you are completely in my hands   110.11349535522042
is your horse tired   107.11749501742814
is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information   34.18595782265305
but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with   153.17198933138894
i am a priest and confessions die in my breast   74.04004076626157
i shall be delighted to have your opinion   70.38568230839522
i entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if i may venture to tell you so i also feel anxious   90.65315121944755
the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution   183.55622953837377
come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature   152.59004837162058
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which porthos went to the gaming table   147.52565881299557
de morcerf said monte cristo quietly   135.6905845352168
no tomorrow   44.12903659398235
to the palais   70.50594429554957
the child was small for his age and unnaturally pale   103.31247910435326
for don t you see renée the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale   86.04992311273456
the abbé scarron   76.04524867867147
carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few words to him pointed with her finger to teresa   63.332897286426444
he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help come   136.19267285230316
and raoul fell back trembling upon his chair   83.78926783162444
they did not scruple much in the case of athos   94.12921888566743
do not open the pie till you are alone   132.76404807034618
richelieu thought d artagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance   77.82410034234373
let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask   179.6383580800407
and by whom are you forbidden   161.42147267932893
although d artagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words   158.50025203450218
do you not father   104.38324228188499
for my part i declare d artagnan i think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom   79.64466709828073
the king will be delivered at the tribunal said athos   150.7709411636562
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend   100.24670337797629
none my lord   42.06143998624232
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair   192.08634432401962
d artagnan was a woman and still more a mother   136.21674317327566
you are free to night without fighting   91.58249065136592
by five minutes   128.88836767491085
oh delightful   97.20114567556513
this manoeuvre transparent to the duc de beaufort was quite unintelligible to la ramee   87.32121148510276
and he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper   117.97934391436849
isn t there a great and grand one the convent of jesuits   169.78980459082038
nothing has happened to him i hope said the count frowningly   161.47260610965213
now here montaran we will do better than that let each take a half   23.969862001568416
i believe they do   123.82718167138995
then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event   44.1332620164068
asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to bertuccio half to the notary   49.6757689777417
adieu my noble and generous friend adieu   173.84597475271815
they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word   74.78364423963473
true replied grimaud   161.06698545855022
madame said villefort believe me a fortune of 900 000 francs is not so easily renounced   120.18907838891609
he said to himself what chateau   46.53970286391801
at last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threatening still like a panther thirsting for blood she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate though they had never done her the least injury   150.20174387868377
four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration   110.70250778059034
then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligible home home   167.731674386907
nevertheless they felt convinced that all was as it should be as it was done by the order of athos   105.68137297771095
but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me   116.3295307804776
overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of fear   99.92508017698205
your courage can not be doubted   140.822469508871
no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure   109.09033284151042
the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door   150.731287850789
milady asked some questions about the carriage   116.69269961392193
are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw   153.9577612496711
if i ever find him again and i will find him i swear were it in hell   53.80477341475081
it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker   96.58016012537068
do not let that disturb you i have enough for two   114.22207483326265
my friends monsieur   106.20159221490073
pity me help me   116.02798197564887
here monsieur mazarin is everything   122.85470187307214
indeed i fear 40028m valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmother s last injunctions   215.6752703876751
my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house   186.30477613097273
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly   100.53820418153688
yes monsieur said mousqueton but in a very ill humor   109.0996469979724
now continued carlini if i have done wrongly avenge her   104.93602667513684
this man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under coat   156.67863578302266
it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it   26.16016336983155
for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures   115.2897492087389
then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress   128.34796004871856
saddle our horses take your carbine   115.6904387044901
first my lord   74.83176539321774
you wish to know what i will do   101.71227060456602
but don t fancy that i am going to take you on your bare word   85.50902098687648
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentleman that of the army   100.44001051624187
but that s impossible   80.31182028881747
the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter re entered it   78.85845311801769
here are thirty francs   136.04673395638173
this woman passed for his sister   68.06397792718342
so that three of the king s musketeers one of whom was wounded and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal s guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth   117.2367268827026
he would have stayed here fifty years i ll answer for it without any attempt to escape   153.3329548643945
30183m what do you say   56.74293612655901
an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss   63.79262485139233
two feet of earth removed and dantès fate would be decided   60.930944062430974
as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom house officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past   26.32991017117159
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night   210.30257908136159
that angel resembles the one i have lost   149.32267388675797
this evening said the governor when the task was ended   121.92331015447402
so you are free now and rich   141.87393303296304
then i renewed the search   60.567587895424666
bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at porto longone   170.74479125830572
in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your fellow citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled   90.80769625358714
but you my dear d artagnan   126.62464471761191
but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier   100.00202631034853
while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince i laid a few snares in the runs   111.0485675867806
it is the truth however   179.1479132635975
we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly   61.953255126967655
i have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women   135.86236774028947
it is not here   131.9555835646212
tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger   90.80906686924556
no i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the cardinal   143.51710926589254
did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem   38.24084857757151
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux   100.7326193531316
but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion   70.33436716942387
if you reveal it to anyone in the world i shall be lost and perhaps yourself likewise   123.90007914498547
de villefort even would not have alarmed him   231.84423809243503
i am accustomed to adversity   82.41678487211627
is monsieur aramis with d artagnan   127.64673406149784
and so he was murmured caderousse   127.15175992094876
you notice my ring   69.68692639750711
did you not tell me it was a family jewel   60.901844533007285
when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son   133.0305851061769
to day i am engaged in a different affair   171.00436916982403
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep   148.52217993827946
that assassination was a mysterious affair said villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person   156.35622580878106
but i really pity this poor comte de wardes since you have ceased to love him   129.97082375728473
which is to say that the gascons made a king of me myself seeing that i am my father s son is it not tréville   147.11419050217242
five minutes afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart   104.21411895456954
the crime which i have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just done   54.514162992814875
though i remember in our affair of the rue férou i received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same effect   120.35337687084794
there was a silence of several seconds   129.34972849704914
and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air   74.27311924693345
hem thought monte cristo he begins to conceal his losses   132.0507094724898
alexander vi   18.515299227914056
dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety   76.82513785629403
noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage i forbid you to understand him   140.07690478285735
four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first room   93.16324294739141
ah monsieur returned julie it is treason in my brother to bring you thus but he never has any regard for his poor sister   86.10408686809198
that s correct   67.44300169904733
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father   149.1558088189343
canst thou speak any patois   68.02247626506855
no but he is proud of them   69.14183585504928
chapter 37   108.60047099526209
father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you   42.039103240081914
yes my good master cried bertuccio casting himself at the count s feet it was simply vengeance nothing else   48.8680825473174
the south was aflame and to assist even on his death bed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès was stigmatized as a crime   103.11374701412956
it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond fixed his eyes   92.16033835740294
the visitor was about fifty two years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe   147.58789864324342
above all she is very rich at least i believe so said monte cristo   86.13618569625532
i feel easy replied porthos   143.96793002575868
peter   114.55253800101866
for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous   120.42187768096018
but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive   110.05476772723743
but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper   18.493199309267823
franz d épinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will   119.63930910403181
your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events   99.45987487261152
replied mazarin with his italian smile   107.24643271743132
for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his eminence had rarely recourse to such means   198.2956512294843
my lord escape   82.14808761886451
replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity   105.38399894238918
from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd   19.922085547417396
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth   77.11681270099808
just like the women replied d artagnan coolly   168.40468326747072
he is a priest said bragelonne he has worn the tonsure   79.1900420124272
that is perfectly admirable   112.16725944408853
bonacieux entered   191.12152554280652
d avrigny show yourself a man   67.48514657938465
i dare say such a thing might be had   216.9562679132921
no the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it   148.85744306039962
you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a rider   99.16443764853963
the general doubted my fidelity   205.55091509301738
my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible   95.31462000522835
our expedition lasted nearly six weeks   143.22982729302504
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way   93.44914765739576
i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders   47.59207751316073
the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands   50.5262963008731
dantès read it   120.50043939681396
d artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment   97.92994641970274
noirtier was a true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had predicted   159.4916033266659
you have nothing to do but to overtake it   189.62474566546194
i only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all   90.27689882508396
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects   99.6000550940343
la jeune amélie was first at the rendezvous   133.71842378127062
yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say i told you   84.20846906506121
what do i want   93.6458020944696
the curates asked him what was to be done   121.93305802143419
no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters   31.510571600906573
and if mme   16.250740087503004
de morcerf as the officer fernand mondego   144.76401837802754
it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us   217.9782689490047
so much the worse said valentine smiling   167.28509468574248
my very own   90.09569307080733
said grimaud who had not spoken a word   108.8544692475657
but then we know that understanding was not his strong point   69.88494849337067
the ante rooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards   141.84855755129092
don t lose a word of what i m going to say to you porthos   103.42612894955417
what is the day of the month   150.343441153512
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake   67.4019226787737
her face is very pale and i have listened in vain   151.7235286811365
cried she my god   85.53116967236643
gentlemen said groslow i beg you will take your places   132.42445805916964
any way mother   106.67293410191635
now then said villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook i must have another   175.85593830429656
monsieur i implore you do not stay there   165.81848990576043
treat me in the same way   96.89526442455053
and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs   93.78693641224373
at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started up   144.61524456864416
i have avenged myself   117.30747089803327
20295m and what did you do with the child   110.59781048347133
julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster   78.56509502340441
50209m the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the street   148.22801560064568
well how is he now   161.7249156910117
what do you require then   227.20148538762146
i wager that i uttered a thousand extravagances   61.14997053282142
morrel did not turn round he expected these words of cocles the agent of thomson french   151.5997654715527
it is very evident that it is the letter w which m   161.33784670628916
but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a man s head inside the carriage   208.32942500316366
shall i suffer like this long   156.1759909625135
the english do they dislike wine   131.18450051860884
do they know him   44.455427144000026
parry bent over his master s hand and kissed it respectfully   134.6827370551715
he would have written or at this instant someone knocked at the door   71.6380713852095
but you guitant are not a courtier   175.73772293275525
the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz d épinay s possession signed by me and with a postscript of m   149.73773601916167
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier   92.74612015813409
but what probability was there that mme   176.21170965868154
decidedly and honestly   114.07283842786248
on the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their stuart they shall see him   47.5216610704272
forget them for a time   171.15803780949477
had we not better lower our heads   133.8554697452014
do not forget that   86.30807813245993
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint   108.16092133835777
alas said athos we depart alone   56.209706406551476
is my wife s fortune five hundred thousand livres   110.6925737455806
there said d artagnan this is capital   121.87258055810149
i promise you my lord never to part with it replied athos   205.9044344768289
if beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will the satisfaction to you will be the same   161.54987771804258
then turning to maximilian with an adorable smile   211.6672376087006
i faith the treasonable word is out   69.86804746683009
i have it with me   94.91976013969445
then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp   153.6793260812853
a great loss   104.31267425455333
oh as to that i do not engage myself   75.77786493028071
by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness   210.366356121938
and there will be fine doings if you do not take care   97.86803647155499
d artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle   143.0063204027735
at last louis xiii   49.69378302660756
will you tell me that your three damned musketeers athos porthos and aramis and your youngster from béarn have not fallen like so many furies upon poor bernajoux and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead   125.80828444724388
ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy   58.95143503981129
that was no reason for staking my diamond   191.3344510408259
so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize you   97.66461645001029
tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old man s madness   133.70753831027173
aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud   91.35034947266296
he made a sign to cocles who went first   104.24065772914254
noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m   62.98959195485999
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her   74.51634495634406
d artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy   102.68941170372597
from their beds of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading cæsar s commentaries and by danglars studying the life of alexander   31.63998074249926
it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down   134.4914700554136
she is then now at malta   139.0087427985183
the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner   124.73045002493362
opposite the tower of london he found the vessel that had been named to him delivered his letter to the captain who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to sail   131.66286439023855
he had gained much information but not enough   88.66842838627697
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that   79.5020206600962
the corso was light as day   90.08486377597812
every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village   175.83288130207126
beware said m   137.26246889885638
you will go to marseilles said dantès for you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them   134.71028758510784
where do you come from now   188.03160376544653
then seeing his son he fell into his arms pale and trembling   90.35327558899532
they stopped on the road but you continued yours   143.3285586903685
the fortune of war my dear viscount the caprice of fortune   137.25857889446021
then i will go alone   141.85567682216276
the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything   128.2046692389784
replied the young man where are you   109.43204780505025
and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos   111.39029459497917
it will do me good   78.13185858574025
there was a third point in view which will appear hereafter   120.61717321949985
demanded he of the paralytic   137.2488785893923
it is urgent that i should have this money without delay   34.27087126395281
danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart   173.97371044163887
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier   1.2457417395862507
keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of man   69.12211843558401
you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive   172.04901305428768
well well said the count who told you that   148.94993692164152
and i in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me   184.84664223659067
on whom then   31.23985679604027
said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good   107.1309754038103
without this danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his cell   97.9580753285877
very well until the moment when the comte de la fere resumed raoul said come bragelonne draw your sword   118.0040491406991
the first advantage had been gained by buckingham   121.33233642222993
and franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day   144.61635814834125
then i shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother   188.5493787366034
athos looked at him intently   82.51826334482813
there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third time   195.9803664551162
please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin   83.11545654720244
do you know this ring   112.60458288352625
he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter   80.08560415221014
i said porthos i am entirely of d artagnan s opinion   175.24676236444355
and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothing   148.55155703427795
what was the expression of his face   211.96979927746082
but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness   117.40472023982227
valentine shall come down into the drawing room   135.94373836627096
it is my soul that must be saved   124.55506699362961
among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him   124.51038803171156
it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria and in making himself loved by dazzling her   98.5670972752589
another gasconade   99.25220783156209
monsieur was already such a good theologian said bazin almost weeping   86.67742795096909
i have parted with him   105.29073900821422
mazarin breathed again   126.25411173911151
and if i make a promise i must keep it   175.0604349327583
and taking it from felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it   21.150533128488988
that is reasonable since he is an only son   160.01843157970194
you are not a priest   154.78966349185748
it was the day after that upon which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto when the latter was to learn his father s name   94.87928009107067
give me the letter   136.77593620038266
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance   159.27860106363832
you had nothing left   99.17624626331296
well listen baptistin what did i tell you this morning when i called you into my laboratory   137.7773832967705
whatever happens let us not leave england before the crisis   122.99258013569856
she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide   59.988664071103805
the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided forward   130.41947023837045
no madame   107.74511868454404
undoubtedly i know it but it is a mystery   135.04330776631224
this however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his majesty s health   118.19572940663502
the warm pressure made d artagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked himself   101.07286125299727
de villefort and i am ready to prove it   96.23230502452697
jean had struck three quarters past two   40.48345818488467
in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study   41.13563187601967
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard d artagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal   179.34288450554806
good news   19.72988252949736
impostor indeed   139.65694492453238
yes but he couldn t understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return   76.19647235176903
you were right he said my dear monsieur d artagnan and you can not set out yet   112.16532434020179
he might have been taken for a statue   36.88584603482879
tell me is not her father baron danglars   87.22094755764459
no but i was brought up in corsica   97.71255617908449
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse   87.29578021789537
but i like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves   77.57588404427781
well and what are you going to do at st   131.17062778342685
we need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels   152.07229487409603
he had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach house ready for him   17.10777087250935
arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to ali to stop   72.49424484393138
and as he said it was an ancient name   168.1277026932571
valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening   79.61309379848254
whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve abandon the exterior the material appearance for the invisible principle for the invisible principle is everything   143.7133924005398
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd   133.78217920909967
that woman that woman   54.657694551108214
but her cries were soon stifled   104.41766664796671
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s mousetrap   73.20254220668264
has he wit or not this demon d artagnan   123.46555755841707
those devilish scotchmen are always thirsty   34.27266143500378
excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary   156.8010215211237
caderousse signed it   86.53217651822165
asked porthos who perceiving that d artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two   107.1162504879594
are you ambitious   124.89831771542029
but he did not appear to recognize him   137.81783362230743
oh yes with all my soul   74.71874605870622
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard   133.2364954415983
let us rather persevere in our researches   112.60063376049297
30065m but i remember it perfectly interposed the darling edward   40.23709283644435
that would be nothing for us four   124.53683918069686
aramis and his thesis d artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurator s wife   148.06307050516457
one drop will restore life as you have seen   90.08881219500658
no one can say that m   131.35330394887296
you would do so   165.0054927280736
on reaching her room eugénie locked her door while louise fell on a chair   118.27191508384718
assassin of buckingham assassin of felton assassin of my brother i demand justice upon you and i swear that if it be not granted to me i will execute it myself   173.65009548540766
chapter 53   133.6133871779248
well since i gave you a fourth of my gains i think you owe me a fourth of my losses   107.24317000452145
do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him   131.4995520306475
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong   148.3973362014741
i fell upon one knee then upon both   102.59350189602078
morrel subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy monte cristo exercised over everything around him did not endeavor to resist it   114.4051376098022
the palais de justice communicated with the prison a sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clock tower of the accoules   74.48823407295939
all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office   193.28949981612774
dear excellent friend murmured albert still burning the papers   130.76748087512144
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty   133.07883415585394
already rich he held a high official situation though only twenty seven   117.14708048822114
pardieu gentlemen said he   166.3715955692766
if the news be inauspicious we must fly this night   78.95781631575134
said she in a hollow voice   95.56039752974088
and what do you mean to do   74.70300692063535
in addition to the levees of the king and the cardinal there might be reckoned in paris at that time more than two hundred smaller but still noteworthy levees   40.21972271922927
they went out   146.7449586922395
i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii   162.90102353192486
and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing   144.78393277974683
place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me   131.268961034671
porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture   104.61792261181257
things look black enough replied porthos   96.37279420867046
it was in his service that my father made his fortune   223.2686777043054
in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks   96.15516792424073
at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris   178.95139156670325
take the detachment and conduct him to his place   96.14994004856634
the four walls alone remained as he had left them   174.48490870098732
it is the counsel of a madman and i should be more mad than you did i not stop you at once with the word impossible morrel impossible   139.780382326935
continued the old lady with a fearful expression that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty   150.01934231012342
but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in society   101.11177822940934
de villefort the object of unusual attention and we had almost said of general admiration sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him   140.81459239335797
in your place i would do one thing   116.59756444913974
in that way i discovered that the charming traveler was marie michon   108.1941576083145
tell me now can you deny all this   118.28231660984859
mercy   22.70990418086464
you are really too difficult to please   156.98252053040227
baptistin appeared   61.02237394597941
holidays   82.31067399213185
you were seated upon cushions in the spanish fashion   118.39166817292435
the arts change about and make a tour of the world   108.22635782489623
inquired monte cristo laughingly   64.66673649779506
during this passage felton related everything to milady how instead of going to london he had chartered the little vessel   48.81859437023351
each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle   187.74859889149795
he likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little mme   163.99514908107233
he was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected humility   144.80797537701696
d artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes   149.2215628519852
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful   117.04376257229208
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp   35.59470385806465
everyone turned towards the procureur who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his nails   85.75491685466582
but mousqueton forages and brings in provisions   80.06776229006552
if he persists   82.02441955756207
the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her   159.92549450565082
there was no time to lose   100.70344639641907
yes i heard this news and knew it even before you could   132.39629012176482
dantès gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing   94.07388517856856
cries of death   89.96486683688445
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression   149.3689576923993
cried athos my son i entreat you   126.02406653380396
i passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind i dreaded   134.63673454104563
you are a prisoner   168.9605348610894
now shall i tell you something   82.95466485783373
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins   169.05432547023796
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber   75.5839732707586
the foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back   52.21414390553779
your eminence may believe added d artagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants   141.1441260943628
unfortunately there are great words as there are great men   134.01029817359833
all day   116.50479919072885
the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene   50.68087259231068
that of the telegraph man was horticulture   74.89151817166967
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves   130.17439013491577
to morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent   93.33054284477357
i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome   118.30180280002183
it was the letter written as our readers know to julie and signed sinbad the sailor   121.11793900621436
it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franz s host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges   134.43726930481614
a burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain   101.53829611032181
the door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared   139.6820326862127
but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so   131.5699472440245
then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man s head he slowly added by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you live   79.21397229747868
villefort knew not when he should return and renée far from pleading for dantès hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover   104.55675944995548
vampa approached the corpse and recognized cucumetto   164.49327356992825
at present i no longer think of it and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government   99.29534942586685
all the other guests followed   87.67395722913525
with those studs   106.74322906402124
there are in this bag three hundred pistoles   172.4646870001857
grimaud translated the question and groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered some full others empty   167.1427317570118
assuredly said d artagnan i admire this piece of prose   147.4611945672122
porthos followed chatting with aramis   72.12825473743096
acknowledge it beauchamp   113.44630754702777
and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent   81.56700893713
there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithful all of course on the part of the hostess   145.05991643613217
in the street   84.52276599375895
carriages now arrived in crowds   152.5666690361914
they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin d artagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens   67.57083934031871
cried d artagnan raising his head and regaining his self possession   82.2968346037849
my friend since i killed chatillon adored of the ladies of saint germain i am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly   78.35084496341264
do i wish to know him   116.44611668473156
cæs   85.85233951901601
have you not seen m   100.01227243615637
he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither   123.40919744876498
athos then shrugged his shoulders and without putting himself in a passion thrashed grimaud   98.34362161274814
and with a rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another subject   121.08361175915879
d artagnan interpreted it   105.58355190974365
heavens   88.2259003774344
a great poet   49.78705465450345
it will soon pass away and as he said so the old man s strength failed him and he fell backwards   178.21301731757893
i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo   137.79867481572415
you are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen   29.04027514088834
teresa with the chief s consent did the same   137.06620127398247
the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt   107.46097584136707
the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first   172.63782788911743
ah yes said a light horseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly   114.3258525279136
at verberie raoul desired olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them   54.656175719532335
when i shut my eyes and think i seem to see it all again   49.6558949038032
i am not very clever at pretexts   81.938460753534
yes the queen   140.27920338374219
and what do you know of him   197.32735382341718
for i only am left and they seek my life   77.24411930329921
then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly   141.50272222759622
farewell monseigneur   131.11204983805192
in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client   135.41979609578854
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides   66.41693941591895
take the hundred pistoles my friend   98.45738574725311
asked andrea of himself   104.32441088297242
all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off   145.2030830053666
no sire for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity   177.33457296497005
i have nothing more to ask of heaven i have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were   55.92856933401938
that is never leave him alone an instant   143.84064699707358
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises   120.87490182058156
the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself   162.19665492347218
ha ha ha   15.197783161700897
some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know   27.733432413791974
faria gazed fondly on his noble minded single hearted high principled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose   116.14065940684974
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people   169.6622218054687
you have kept the secret   92.16496674065974
d artagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands   18.68035565521471
and was he not so   139.83011268668966
then walking towards morrel he took his hand   65.2293466314529
why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way that s all   25.182189272639732
even on the field of battle i have never done that   106.95875041493474
that s because you haven t served said mousqueton   121.85059781729247
there has been a crime said monte cristo   143.28681539198635
is it to do us some ill turn   161.44193397848363
read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger   91.58183349968134
why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed   111.16720806625777
and what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me   126.15647978010308
sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter   152.67758728533846
la ramee came into the room   73.52216515792097
de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m   120.74186837632885
it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together   157.17732662990193
i try to be beloved not feared   139.27511229388375
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god   151.76247478915138
i embrace you with all my heart   64.98897069575693
to saddle gentlemen   168.54153338320407
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance   151.96640377888386
for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees effaced   70.32102478570917
said albert entering   138.48468967479988
since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all   68.11187736563255
felton lowered his head and reflected   100.24438809200393
and my only heir are you not   180.5042641560865
said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment   110.63825141304699
mad you mean don t you   30.922130541680332
said the queen never   73.22678515581639
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined d artagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal guitant and the rest of the escort   87.55651546870914
ah yes where is my sister   172.06638059736278
nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the rochellais continued to advance in quick time   77.05181324096385
rochefort obeyed and retired   70.41917420032883
d avrigny i would not accuse anyone   87.60141493576639
take away vasiliki   96.12625817701756
cried valentine calling her step mother and running upstairs to meet her   155.91179788838542
it leaves its track   102.3895280119157
madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago   62.55708868566519
and then some son in law or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a king   109.94212651438758
come then said d artagnan you are right   192.03196128992488
no on the honor of an officer   159.348115258768
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment   135.11663801769748
let me pass   89.58766218265392
asked mazarin smiling   160.06197861001485
take all needful precautions replied the inspector   132.15098975850378
he must be a vampire   78.05218812165126
40194m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered   67.73215720498517
cried aramis and d artagnan at the same time   174.34468763735026
all all all are thine my adored mistress   18.8161303403037
said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in d artagnan s proposal pooh   116.88589725865506
morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance   69.20781606702273
and tis a child he loves   82.28028972699573
what is he himself   150.77919996641523
heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o clock   165.11782105802527
oh it is all my wife s fault   157.88584892167506
albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand   115.60801224469334
oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renée it matters very little what is done to them   113.78378813704968
muttered fernand   125.62064808371221
she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with   143.58538587040863
but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools and with an air of supreme hauteur said what do you desire monsieur and with what object do you present yourself here   108.39574900575724
all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next a sublime spot a resting place full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking   167.01454668630592
true excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that i acted like a coward   106.81917039889781
said he to the young man who since the death of buckingham had regained that coolness and self possession which never after abandoned him wretch   148.10918275827171
and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me   122.24798738784698
it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress   56.073996482456785
cried la ramee cold sweat upon his brow   88.59727346725455
there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor   141.1527946164237
then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame   81.17745981401521
and moreover it kills said beauchamp   220.88064355130683
by guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight   128.5302726910245
so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are   156.96823577744362
i would lay a wager he has stolen it   91.94039558372467
aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls   76.97961264292942
cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven   121.75658404748113
for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains   109.1149914339027
my child my darling edward   124.67408208481473
and that is why on account of the living mercédès and my deceased father i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand and i have revenged myself   138.8650147314855
but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune   80.37853626324656
let me see what it is   106.13171213186752
monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law   107.11108207022292
you were asking then   93.93917819977906
such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them   198.66975344020435
madame he said i am an abbé it is true but i am so against my will   153.12773142449913
i will introduce you to them   130.56932500714873
is it a suitable match   187.05385601252237
replied the secretary resting on the stairs   186.91636887206406
i will never confess that but to the man who should read to the bottom of my soul   69.67374307447221
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start   105.68251778795764
major cavalcanti   121.22340004644843
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the louvre to demand of the queen in your name our broussel s release   142.6525079041328
oh you have some design against me reverend sir   124.45502463698607
anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head   111.40130777732031
but the culprit   26.26954749634824
and the count began his defence i assure you albert in a most eloquent and skilful manner   60.41662389892595
again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head   157.64263632629525
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes   80.11335842850983
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him   113.04362432330899
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city   163.29377389181627
but upon the first step he met lord de winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying i knew it   79.0701709886232
but andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent   171.40303807951724
said the host in spanish   107.13292458223899
you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the room indeed i fancied i had destroyed it   145.73933792146866
what are there no grottos at monte cristo   78.35644322360864
he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over her   130.06995121448702
there is a third and the most terrible that is my condition as a mortal being   105.48391315554095
we have still a word to say to these gentlemen   52.97365123563123
i am her best friend   121.26036301927793
but d artagnan had reckoned without the wind   125.54181818298048
said the colonel   149.47349452085393
she opened the door   95.34129632332868
what do you think of monsieur de tréville telling me when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday that you associated with the suspected english whom the cardinal protects   76.83717068248453
yes he murmured yes be satisfied   77.80773249156304
but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence   111.65109105408297
there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others   104.50202993499897
never had morrel witnessed such an expression never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face never had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous nights of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire   135.42312547720428
and he as usual has refused   51.4536074421985
but there he is in the hands of justice   201.33998089298268
of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg™ name associated with the work   69.61269865051747
what do you say to a thousand crowns   210.34496338723181
where is the count   187.01391670224638
madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted   165.0369253193605
d artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal   107.30079236981729
he would not come up   101.72391880415066
he said what is the matter   67.41595055965136
madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action   97.98262429387265
raoul gave it up reluctantly   183.5307728588976
and be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventy six years   93.77980390762141
of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment   165.26673897796294
d artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said here my dear athos this naturally belongs to you   113.53402031137777
thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too malcontent   111.69646086314418
dicers oaths   113.09584057927722
if i did i should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do   55.87367994922664
plague stifle you and your latin   124.80806615201492
well then we will go into paris   135.92921491521255
they had not long to wait   182.87732197849977
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope   115.7902925881795
both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope   72.01847162474957
i mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked it   93.0376796173351
as he departed danglars approached and said well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at porto ferrajo   119.31524900421914
let us hear the means   150.54984930805685
the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of raoul   106.43020436122009
suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth   7.212332632244966
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully   97.93979934005861
she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the thousand and one nights would seem but poverty   40.02810384499226
you may even say my lord replied athos who stickled for propriety   215.67387486468863
he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abbé   125.23539929759441
at all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother in law with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy   90.52747707429995
after the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from m   184.83093073931462
you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to return to africa   60.30795884326207
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere   136.15694133536488
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote to mlle   195.69353134251008
oh i am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller   61.967526935531374
there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii   149.38178370949092
such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it   120.67868345600414
well albert inquired franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall   156.87615811116262
the monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly go on i know nothing as yet   116.78699317357166
the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it   87.56994627213774
it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock   141.05583309085938
but consider d artagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her   145.2885577765017
precisely answered bertuccio   75.6710853089661
you would follow the escort   114.10946822474878
it is possible haydée that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the east may not be practicable in paris   77.54241906406077
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman   171.42873303609048
as for porthos i believe him to be eternal like god although less patient   110.24133892605052
you remarked that we were all active vigorous and armed   104.37984196823298
my good fellow said château renaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly   135.72624326115033
de boville the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome presented himself at m   128.29427516129155
proceed sire i beg   168.1332064986742
and d artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one   73.55248683667149
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water   186.04004713107818
you know dear d artagnan i am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman   176.12406208820448
my wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in thought   90.12802793289136
said athos to his adversary   96.21606571503867
you will take a biscuit with it will you not   132.340115166085
i do not know her name   121.82509242052036
how so general   76.68713167034245
at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard   168.2723438728977
felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord over the handkerchief   172.0876111049954
during the daytime valentine s perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m   91.86065881559398
twelve replied aramis   104.27564000886073
who then has so correctly informed you   110.38431023740316
did you know her   86.21599109977782
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only   255.23673975652886
he was very taciturn this worthy signor   199.2018025029493
mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general s face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything   168.32528039237155
bertuccio said he give fifty five thousand francs to monsieur   63.504066003484624
come in my host   158.09822723135346
i like everyone   165.09511930176745
returned the prince   117.20516623537523
if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of france   130.27045778202466
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary   103.97632383711154
she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner   76.23738267187319
in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it   124.4247319567526
though he was in his own element   116.3924120540463
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand   132.57886480777026
where does he live   89.19053316781634
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman s side   92.16548148912078
i did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir   73.51935915219798
now as a half smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined   132.4470439317925
and madame de saint méran   160.29715420927835
i had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor   128.7362278836039
she then slowly raised her head which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance ran to the door to listen looked out of her window and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair she reflected   157.44953409105446
as to the key it had disappeared   112.27040946470977
in ten minutes they will perhaps be here   119.70536753789956
a great effect upon d artagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady   106.74965562977204
pretty mysterious initiated in almost all the secrets of the court which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved   74.79790077236102
kitty entered to bring some sherbet   172.1250580816734
and the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn   77.9776156645926
come in exclaimed d artagnan   82.9911807060609
yes it s true   126.75214671512852
mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one   224.35934649901787
he pressed aramis s hand and went in search of porthos   175.54840147936156
no nonsense caderousse   150.05870935409118
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great lady for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass   70.73293718987864
and la ramee resolved never again to disobey these injunctions   167.25634244916253
said the major   156.95222980669706
asked caderousse shuddering   131.70449202365342
mordaunt replied by trying his opponent s weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble   18.753541611566106
o reilly   128.53514845935604
but there are four against you   106.28699164677579
what i have said i will do   79.54437766973248
replied porthos   146.27908240686799
i don t see why   230.07538724973793
for of course you know   119.81832782013069
where is the child   217.7256782675786
i have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire   93.4728037382055
if i am victorious he will not marry valentine and if i die i am very sure valentine will not marry him   172.2417275638818
this very day   156.36562470970074
but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living   105.37322860008662
let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously   156.3107933722882
the world is not wanting in attractions   112.1294078135587
get me out of this in heaven s name   73.72540594128725
you tell me said franz at the moment signor pastrini was about to open his mouth that you knew luigi vampa when he was a child he is still a young man then   129.7145890469406
i have been made a baron so that i actually am one   153.41583277377885
grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time   53.08957258600322
i must have wronged you in some way at marseilles   96.40786992864558
during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts   169.9961832636199
maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss   96.47484159186229
it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor   84.44580582049325
cried d artagnan yes   70.96906487471804
unfortunately i have no idea where they are   142.5487450436437
my friends retire   92.58690684532714
and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice   8.081229688703118
what a devil of a face you have porthos   190.9197401876207
well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name   101.64777469215805
put an end to my doubts   79.09583366520769
wait an instant said the host   163.45505983424874
watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can   30.709014419507028
thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly   209.8156837583901
sensible   98.58405667834967
said mazarin i have been proving it to you this last hour   96.03018451503641
i was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur franz   132.80102457517268
i only speak that exact truth   40.67644670407951
i had forgotten that england was an island and that you were the king of it   107.750964843937
he ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boatman   138.74708607666926
so you see we must do without this little superfluity   80.54991339776299
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career   117.98377877331085
is he still amusing himself in italy   137.3500086833804
it is true also that as i did not then know his eminence if i had been able to dispense with the visit i should have been enchanted   34.677959614132575
madame danglars and eugénie were going out at that moment   112.81642716510801
your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment   8.943281375958236
besides my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes continued la ramee and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort   123.22839359470278
that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight   129.62392845666392
may we inquire what is this recipe   144.9487850750997
my father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire   77.26808493664797
the colosseum franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire   84.3164521850677
i am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living   40.94052233346888
may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it   191.45283466186748
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardes he whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governor s country house   179.31716030289755
bonacieux called a long time   94.14168851799056
the musket fell from the soldier s hands who yielded on the instant   87.62214617415876
employ it and you will find that you derive advantage therein   166.9098262719723
jump directly down close to monsieur de la fere or on the honor of a gentleman i ll kill you   128.5703543464372
volume three 30009m 30011m chapter 48   123.6191535290042
little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians i should not have thought this the place for such a demand   93.31856052490275
my friend said morcerf with a sweet smile that is what i wish   226.5958415057333
0329m but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention   114.330771984162
why do we hate   76.3705732413273
his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love   123.88891229118798
an expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of milady   110.25583738099205
stay my dear count said danglars   141.37531495648233
madame bonacieux   142.75728750825525
i believe you are right   75.89382083086964
my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me   101.88048782178885
with the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of france   113.05228016070765
it is chilly this evening   168.08340349788944
you would wish a notary to be sent for then   133.0084468938886
nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey s visits   174.4341078761353
yes said the queen   171.65999705191376
dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work   114.91871547689277
i knew you were a corsican   87.34845023197178
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man s eyes   128.80180840803095
and who is to pursue him   60.674557846185905
yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and i would lay down my life for them   204.76554680821113
gentlemen said d artagnan you shall have your turn   199.9614647083808
milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme   227.77493817706673
the three millions are probably on the road   125.10951752095342
i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile   78.89426727457169
if you come from ali himself said selim you know what you were charged to remit to me   196.20500917239
yes yes continued morrel   104.0191526451613
try me gentlemen said he and i swear to you by my honor that i will not go hence if we are conquered   137.6366909200342
you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money   90.81455426606996
and who brought you up   156.33825604059334
and make la ramee eat the pear answered grimaud   85.32954803669718
a quarter to ten   84.14358853664265
at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself   12.01147141797567
and thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were   81.71133514048893
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis   146.61429506318953
then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right   161.69581917601852
a giant had seized also aramis s two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp   110.36465568308637
as i am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if i do not understand all the subtle refinements of your language   124.00968496084221
god will help you   102.46197408604745
i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability incognito   62.582018708111605
cried buckingham i really think he threatens me   70.45025143414068
cried the steward   164.15675483687292
cloud in front of the pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of m   126.71957706129768
and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i have told you of my love and my hopes may i inform you of my intentions   199.92903423708577
perhaps i turned pale and trembled but certainly i smiled   135.0119840871864
they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville   41.10029507286265
beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness   169.3927951050724
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head   202.04165987380324
madame de chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile   77.11046386035945
why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden   188.7925014208386
if porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said athos   89.22223274913323
he exclaimed thy vengeance is sometimes delayed but only that it may fall the more effectually   149.60580124019833
no no she vociferated no you can not wish that   120.82925860952123

on his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses laced   117.24164417612872
and then immediately the eyes of porthos wandered anxiously   6.857186421903748
demanded the swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry   90.18627433395491
i ran to the hospital and learned that the same night the night of the 20th of september a child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half   110.64978209006004
but let s get back to the subject   90.41369686492153
well then said cromwell i promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request   141.1164521984308
cried mademoiselle paulet bitterly he   141.280888297333
general said the president we acknowledge no king louis xviii   87.50866477724588
franz d épinay i am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villefort s absence and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me   85.32622805997266
you speak of him very much at your ease aramis   47.45440033834714
why then are you about to betray it to me   96.86950491746337
we have learnt nothing forgotten nothing   85.34582612450397
on the evening of the day after the arrest of poor bonacieux as athos had just left d artagnan to report at m   109.74473451088343
that gentleman is the abbé d herblay replied he   41.34447200967794
then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all   38.11179164389101
from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his   122.38172294184479
then said d artagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal   85.35353980698116
noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night   127.21069198829613
sketches torn from the album of dauzats travels in the east that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosque in a word all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past   136.5106708200597
it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot   50.785797158157735
i trust you have brought this rabble to reason   132.32812403037488
stay said monte cristo here in this very spot and he stamped upon the ground i had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old trees   200.8533277384625
valentine could not reply   83.96348781346258
noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary   85.28628730325917
since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his servant   201.52063000131076
it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him   147.9096550147582
oh yes i read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my memory   82.77574677486896
and pardieu i picked up two that i sold for ten pistoles each   127.84427154672761
when you went to fetch your wife from the louvre did you always return directly home   64.51724481606692
all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament   160.4202128862936
and now where are you going viscount   115.1411509826259
because i would not annoy my little benedetto   56.02429686429006
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past   112.35847971595842
de tréville in his office contiguous to this antechamber received visits listened to complaints gave his orders and like the king in his balcony at the louvre had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms   149.61201617486068
if the king consented to see them they would only have to be called   91.94618945882692
you count who are more than mortal will i am sure lead me to death by a pleasant path will you not   47.52980289344494
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husband s father   140.26650965962287
marie michon oh what do i not owe you aramis   101.23834114228893
i have already recorded sentence of death five or six times against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart   45.796712480647955
i know that name a son of monsieur de broussel s servant and a lad that i promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs   122.14374148487029
she has answered you   88.32381280947075
do you believe you have anything to do   91.39221043107518
it was then half past six   163.47939368530552
the same evening andrea was incarcerated in the conciergerie   147.66673087968397
we are alone sir said buckingham   104.79017670124134
the look which m   92.19092228088414
i gave her my wealth i gave her my name   48.608082182268305
mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying little   51.09740851696165
at this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and space   138.58570640497567
the appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation   86.33401299888087
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof   58.80276178527536
and the consequence   148.54867308269473
have we ceased to be men   115.44165152640157
now let me try on the dress of yonder chap   70.39430740080928
no i did not say i was a stranger to you   90.19377261128541
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates   164.56703635416676
isn t it reasonable   87.45251814399181
the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known   119.01814413834006
the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion   145.9838627456704
he must be about twenty three years of age said athos in a low tone   97.51336796238414
at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry   41.77593000553969
de villefort and his father exchanged looks   92.83204571172284
had surrounded himself this second or rather this first king of france became desirous that he too should have his guard   131.48906247084489
shall i assist you in repairing your negligence   113.40212183530517
moreover he is but a child said aramis   131.00588209574505
my father said the young man bending his knee bless me   140.73190015829155
asked anne of austria after a moment s silence   108.78420468629889
he almost believed in the crime of de wardes   52.46243167208054
and above all mademoiselle danglars   127.27818203472167
it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise   96.01297150114956
then sir since you are so liberal i ought to offer you something   174.69432252219224
a horse for planchet that s all   99.65421221302597
athos did not even turn his head   172.7679214199245
the officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy   97.61446135487287
the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant   92.49945466221908
said aramis hastening forward   172.2713987269275
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior   119.38651415200482
and he conducted them to mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece   94.52127584436556
the expulsion took place and i pocketed 600 000 francs the day charles v   82.5682993796101
perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them   142.24798447237453
exclaimed the man half suffocated   111.87440534268285
that will do   108.262432567239
happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry in which he was secreted by an old woman together with his brother the bishop of meaux   155.86849499367452
i confess it openly   131.27863059150252
he gave no other name answered julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letter sinbad the sailor   170.0781186968426
no my dear coadjutor said mazarin   105.48121412989553
nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak   199.06901142331031
14 besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself   121.87293674232218
he inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs   167.25920997952502
ah it s all one said the host   144.31938232044558
nothing replied the count   126.7201273832356
de tréville a long history about the queen   96.85985533882574
but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth and making a powerful effort to control himself he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips and went out   131.64771087333742
in fact they touched the sloop   75.52394948073581
i do not know you   174.59263314700334
mercédès has no fortune   82.32373891453977
why we can not tell   74.04314614169408
de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentine or still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to 80 000 livres per annum   116.10563987794659
more likely he has been speculating on the bourse and has lost money   116.55923820975802
they killed six thousand angevins in sicily because they pronounced italian badly   137.10142107074478
he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing room   85.6812806665512
and to give more weight to his protestation caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé who remained motionless in his place as calm as ever and pursuing his interrogation   82.01276087292393
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all   144.08162235977193
excellency the evil has arrived   70.81168683283505
but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms   128.71815266426904
but i did not expect you   156.86968740366433
will our help come from you   175.7718275330283
said porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands   118.33179107151315
unfold your plan my lord and we will see   70.55487861611341
private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business   156.64241110328592
i was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you i acted in opposition to my orders   165.00535342625227
30325m no she replied it is for my poor grandmother   103.16038889720483
she told me to wait and i waited   144.70945675100918
proceed said the president   128.7854343668273
porthos yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator s wife as a bark yields to the rudder arrived at the cloister st   173.93911452304607
so can i said the englishman and he laughed too   135.22303816440404
i will tell you all said valentine   154.08219265782256
bravo said beauchamp to albert   143.84820199949837
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name   158.65300785996175
he found him completely surrounded   154.13737222982138
i believe he s swimming toward us   101.80253501393365
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round   56.10714244128887
albert was punctual   131.09040539959815
you remain minister   50.52733258478381
the gate of the enclosure was shut   172.12080534072732
yes i think i received a flower pot upon my head   140.3746533600849
as soon as she saw him she seized his hand   103.28771043576506
but is this all that is known   139.48491010123666
yes as an augustine monk   153.40554544135298
then madame said the abbess smiling be reassured   32.832272810724845
if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister   61.251384153330285
besides is he not a butcher s son   133.43668424489564
and dantès happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend s mental instability glided like a snake along the narrow passage   134.61460672018825
the man resembled aramis so much as to be mistaken for him   153.35193314665815
a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings   163.87926248752873
then putting the 4 500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs élysées   111.54244884024882
valentine chapter 103   65.75753059577184
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time   185.37070629810256
we were in a place where it was not very cold replied porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him   199.6692496680551
or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes   97.81483141111642
grimaud signified that he was not mistaken   101.97034891536985
he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy   80.54065108752188
the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida   91.87812869233825
while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum   94.79550640339644
st   73.43411566973563
i think he is a delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably   120.10549375644173
i have pursued it for six years only   88.25997948293214
well i must mortify myself   103.42397919891849
the hand of god caderousse continued to call piteously help reverend sir help   192.66496549343339
say absurd since it has become useless   105.36874318483954
but where are you going   196.60011396486232
you must manage it all   67.05632081501668
you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont henrietta   138.23497624608495
before you leave me tell me what you are going to do maximilian   149.6306760900676
16 the god of fruitfulness in grecian mythology   81.12279171370852
the valet then left the room   76.43663790611615
well have you made up your mind to this journey   139.15126874240988
he was a man of execution this worthy porthos   189.36275239623347
as for me i should have been incapable of it said château renaud with most significant coolness   96.88989222618821
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like d artagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light d artagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville   97.19812885501005
i am precisely of the contrary opinion   89.04900969306442
grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened   131.9923831210378
that would save us all   182.69620928040658
in the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more   177.6115170133007
inquired the old man   117.98355624694912
he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest   145.7304117498731
he then looked at the objects near him   109.02033186953489
therefore i will retire for i can not endure the sight of blood   83.3621812427687
there said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire   114.45952156254853
go and perform your master s orders   170.17120136039392
she is my betrothed   182.80863861563026
who is this athos   117.67328893051489
at ten o clock in the morning the sieur de la coste ensign in the king s guards followed by two officers and several archers of that body came to the city registrar named clement and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel   181.5581402034589
tis true my lord answered la ramee that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent   123.72878227068604
what is the matter my lord   153.09849207519056
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case   72.75979585954374
the beggar the evening passed on   150.69664782157463
they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not   125.15801044570881
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champs élysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel   73.16701844133124
five minutes after andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus   166.07307308308597
then in a menacing tone he said sir   107.24745504220282
but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet   133.01020141199982
he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles   118.2894082415416
did he come to arrest me   119.42558135795977
yes doctor cried villefort clutching his hair yes   151.82812480078732
aramis returned home and athos and d artagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire   157.48175943328863
when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door   86.12995483461974
at which the cries of the multitude were renewed   100.95112413816238
and where was this letter written   82.20817807053798
20335m i have the honor i presume of addressing m   101.40071269284955
never mind continued the man in the cloak   161.2476958796441
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice   66.42881942474105
felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the prisoner   187.901342377139
do you not know the race   91.77026717351043
there is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asks nothing   125.86511284551983
at length franz arrived at the word myself   97.65679206992972
if monsieur aramis hesitates to come he said tell him i am from tours   90.15002497661148
the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great coolness   151.74768181834816
it is the first time he has ever been in paris   114.80078035369553
how much have we louise   144.71923076269488
my lord said athos do not let us disturb you   115.36033804500326
when they opened the window they saw the poor lad lying senseless with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork   161.45841997047313
the landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe   107.71631026533332
returned the influence of m   121.84114142086864
and to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floor all undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way   45.26594779265044
it is to be found for the searching   129.757750713514
we must be discreet with this sort of letters   87.62998392406578
every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs   101.9137656932663
that alters the case   88.85164268235475
it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed   111.1962657637491
indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping   96.80780857340409
monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman   0.5682368124734722
then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold valentine   36.442598276302135
no my prince replied mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness   114.04315261787049
i have seen the bastille   86.62945192909062
he drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood   205.69439990452025
possessing five and twenty thousand francs a year besides your place   154.95418854627047
what are they your excellency   113.92865313931267
this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering morrel   175.78177010723425
porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this sword   162.67569560762382
what says augustine on this subject severus sit clericorum verbo   139.4171377348975
and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers   17.082937503063903
but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation   69.60013944706375
villefort   97.93219930126637
it is a long time since that has happened   159.7423462616584
asked villefort with a last effort   142.31606106134683
but d artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m   76.02666804509145
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters   104.71205633469333
has he gone intending not to return   164.43052605700302
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor   12.227542792413757
he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it   76.24721897205102
and you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons were separated by a distance of fifty feet   165.32890276433272
you are deceived morrel that woman she was dead   64.34550693473818
you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening   93.71330380469661
for his death   189.57190126837247
he used to weep he now laughs   139.6156594182834
are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau   111.1122086866382
but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent   106.39908212796092
so then so then pack up our luggage planchet and let us be off   89.98105575382402
i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud   204.2343203540961
and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not   111.26718026714622
ay that smells good   126.3472082562721
and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain   170.37674889918384
the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the custom house officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at beaucaire   80.50127533260097
the young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment and to be branded   139.98911769733675
go sir go   119.66306962229592
and now how are you feeling   96.97944781049246
there was only this blow wanting   192.4035206639012
but at the same time my boy i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it   114.98818105225395
thanks planchet thanks   73.99892882344619
will your eminence be angry if i read you a lesson   120.11687790558994
my dear cousin   192.72459201712445
you have said that my son should live have you not   134.30473662854348
see i send a ball into the moat   120.00340549378541
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step   102.43902515824955
she was my mother   76.83373328705726

resumed morrel   81.82589206926207
choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best   145.15435227540706
with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night   141.64494325143156
yes that poor duchess   131.30670961788877

good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you   77.9821121419086
i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musketoon   114.10313992429239
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina   96.89240288440652
it s a piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much relieved   117.07126208891735

let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of france   64.8731980565405
well it has happened to me to do so in our blaisois forests and i remember that the first time i encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me curled up swinging its head and pointing its tongue i remained fixed pale and as though fascinated until the moment when the comte de la fere your father   132.43758510941595
the boat is waiting for us   64.93084373461143

0081m you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken   61.62795897241953
i must have said the duke a proof of his connection with buckingham   68.43387285197274
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk   88.94877114468267
only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables   151.75351218568602
they arrived at the appointed spot   139.72891189185
but he will not avow it   84.93425408677987
ay and a very fine one   113.08468768249428

however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover   61.13501657511538
no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts but such as he really was at this period   41.668915987075565
once at the house of monsieur créquy   53.97962095199807
sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns   157.7582030271045
danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end   123.96061361746634
and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased   192.47723792689314
some one drew near   151.7707327141308
having thus spoken d artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village   134.01617909478495
how is monsieur bernajoux your esquire s relative   43.866019280203275

a desert would not have been amiss said porthos   141.91847849746785
eh monsieur eh   99.2825291189339

at any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for i have made a rare acquisition   105.28883347551398
order was re established in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another   123.38456982887767
look at monsieur du vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage   61.57813064623674
he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall   111.36102234919312

the clock struck half past six and a lady was announced a friend of madame de villefort who came to dine with her   109.21335744569355
i like to hear him talk said athos   59.826085918430486
i would rather do so was edmond s reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me   124.63493234266737
caderousse approached him just as danglars whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room   51.5434004465576
some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the théâtre italien   182.8220630023843
the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea   167.5478023658822
pity me   106.65714446417222
yes but calumny seized upon all those follies in which i took no part as you well know my lord   121.28443538787093
lord de winter is only her brother in law   107.22713080754816
d artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal   87.95450176473317
asked the jeweller   55.65399718963625
felton was then mistrusted   125.02016933943325
50056m and with this raillery andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd   113.67841723064883
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person   64.75234149423872
what a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his hand   206.47130025340113
there are several branches of the d artagnans at tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal   136.07957771931308
so far i have appeared to answer his purpose   102.06465317818522
and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone   121.81419156014773
he cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall   170.0122828007118
he s one of my most intimate friends   52.91669755199202
the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction   20.44212788167306
the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject   184.27223498014934
of fifty large sausages suspended from the joists scarcely ten remained   102.01005964361354
so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary   33.245491344025865
mademoiselle eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d armilly   64.96286244717186

it will suffice then to tell them that at the moment at which discouraged by so many fruitless investigations we were about to abandon our search we at length found guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend paulin paris a manuscript in folio endorsed 4772 or 4773 we do not recollect which having for title memoirs of the comte de la fère touching some events which passed in france toward the end of the reign of king louis xiii   57.50078000119653
what you say interests me to the greatest degree   173.80708667210834
she would have cut your throat and after that everybody else s   102.21273095931656
though i might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger   126.77627803729037
it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us   189.80084848449127
i will facilitate it by repeating the question will you or will you not retract   138.7645221957162
the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said but where is madame de longueville   81.25486390331334
he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived   208.3238965736657
on the contrary i request it   116.74663961381705
d artagnan said porthos i must out with it at once for i can t keep to myself anything i have against you   127.83223528234501

aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishop s place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at whitehall   96.2820834655605
he will not return until the evening   51.30539592374096
let us see said the queen what the count says   176.22463894074417
and he presented to dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which edmond read as follows   118.12167890675319
cried the queen in the fullness of a broken heart   145.32394775075025
and d artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to d artagnan to serve him as a safeguard   124.0118610573878
lord de winter arrived at the appointed time   206.506311906458
kitty said he i will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like   201.8432060006468
that ring comes from milady   12.842893375987074
your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune   72.65813119872575
but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance   69.61522340784998
no no i will be on the ground at the proper time   96.47669346379112
silence and go the same way you came   142.13099696926417
we did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully   69.21484546961764
on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out who s there   115.8895907358217
i am a priest resumed aramis   46.20467971564723
and the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of contempt   101.09205813976129
i would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself   101.22194718577937
and then i have thought that considering three months lodging about which i have said nothing yes yes   88.32858080923373
because i scarcely know why but it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it   113.08170018302962
should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you no said monte cristo   111.05515993789537
who ever heard of such an occurrence as this   117.96363115029784
how many did we crush under the wall   53.57582541661154
all i have is at his service   136.8817687653298

nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself   112.36623154403503
and now the ranks began to open   173.68832728260315
that man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night   57.577657560697375
aramis related what had been agreed upon   82.73489991112201
i say i am entirely of porthos s opinion replied aramis   179.83142849787828

in the corso   107.66668062933265
sir said madame de saint méran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child   80.6113721413513
and another voice which like an echo repeated dead dead   198.7757020711732
unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself   75.27871044344788
gentlemen your hands   91.4542766450719
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity   130.37307906160407
gervais replied d artagnan from behind which the rochellais annoyed our workmen   73.94927329375912
haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver   27.56375521948563
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work   104.21539386919385
asked the postilion in italian   114.07643953867029
he preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence   95.7275391941505
and you have no servant   128.07012636262579
at this moment the landlord came in   119.664868413611
but what ails you   134.70754881337905
in fact as we have said the whole camp was in motion   82.63448766953346
these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust   115.78557846000682
at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright   189.79105746204866
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way   79.59102270082666

it was a very near thing but he is not dead   129.4473382416742
among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance   174.0554817142341
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister   156.17085602335064
thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures   124.67249717624236
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct   97.77256526446452
today her delirium is almost madness   18.959345111831325
the rabbit died   116.65926387186738
twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half hour   30.835311959137584
our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada   102.64177550945526
he replied he replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what   152.76640661848202
but have the kindness to give the abbé busoni i told you he was not at home repeated the valet   31.830271972200478
command we shall obey   75.1811012881862
noirtier do not complain for it is for you that i came and my journey will be your salvation   98.80338445821053
inquired caderousse with a look of surprise   9.828347365230655
a thousand things   121.96465991287496
i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome   128.3959190096202
however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long   47.2261127355853
it appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves   82.86830710658998
certainly replied albert seeing that without my title i should be nothing   39.84695087411495
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse dantès whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbé s chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick man s couch   131.3407365885611
i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these never ending labors   58.5653680693318
it was then that d artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it   59.65738526282738
ambushes and violences multiplied around me but i resisted   57.585552182939736
a new governor arrived   127.28118396217384
but our mazarin impossible   17.31051614654774
thought dantès   84.69403394746016
but on two conditions   36.923962388486885
the duke however was not dead   53.69477526967396
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back   23.797349058506782
do you require my services now   117.74112724649372
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc   91.74768319640137
you had a new livery yesterday   111.34835556316757
yes i inherited this little property when i quitted the army as i told you   153.26011549504594
on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away   63.78983038723718
are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth   81.38136406401517
the pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her domination   91.66229038152971
chapter lxxii   58.75266230645229
asked the fair traveler   90.46347353894672
great god   80.72078570835016
are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient   159.82217624742805
caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold   66.1471561927464
it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and fernand who put it in the post   104.36420806671198
torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked   62.44731417987795
but you how did you get rid of yours   99.59144851264392
but in accordance with dantès request he began to speak of other matters   113.04745217205908
the cargo on board   139.46606883598122
all london was crowding to the doors of the house   75.89844161707106
what mean you   154.09192323898554
from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize morrel   147.969997995346
the three friends looked at one another and laughed   173.5851333689212
you say she is only a slave   186.40937321552082
well now you understand mother   158.296395218222
d artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys   40.13970069238337
yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a garden you must know it   60.50452275430049
with such a vade mecum d artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait   136.7107077482772
i will   85.48253881973676
i forewarn you signor pastrini that i shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us   160.42607811474286
aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam   145.9507522973519
come in said franz   34.03877822210647
and i idem said aramis   97.59815609747434
she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant   21.184206622441394
and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchet s adventure   146.98504150233313
no i was drunk   79.65643744985522
and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites   57.37458528215485
then the door opened and he appeared   172.9047061744199
wait my dear sir wait a moment   174.97831129664667
whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people   149.32073049001121
of former days my lord   121.4197132693867
well what s the matter   88.50471771248999
he has such a short neck said she   123.73385505476321
at this word apologies a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis   149.90891678539754
here are the horse s hoofs again it seems athos he said carelessly   160.72391285488038
the wounded man smiled sadly   255.45296532769999
rather say that you have a new love   11.293167265453988
exclaimed the king s attorney   90.81323697264361
twenty times he interceded for edmond   106.87196212891313
cried the host at his wits end   70.10819494587093
he therefore told him all   172.90803823165047
sir said comminges declare yourself at once   152.9999379531701
well when you receive the remaining 40 000 you shall give me a receipt in full   78.19220561058195
mademoiselle eugénie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance   175.8842161734449
who sends you   40.679765707512246
i pardon you for the attempts upon my own person   210.4688752379131
are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us   169.5881925838766
that was an oversight certainly replied the count   148.45509672133173
my poor friend   117.89077747316307
five or six minutes elapsed   127.55761428854039
but à propos resumed m   93.1576813449826
you see i am dying   103.66563817000922
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac   60.836713685949476
you approve of him   152.53291553829212
and he withdrew sighing   109.03449375766998
there is no doubt of that   150.43971111876863
said raoul blushing   37.45019641121945
de monte cristo whom you just saw leaving here you did see him i think   133.00768352005034
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance   46.909873973747835
do not speak so loud madame   27.477859210179744
permesso   162.52816139644122
well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends   154.8304223699765
this will change the aspect of french affairs but i much fear it will do nothing for english even if it does not harm them   105.43900040205102
i sailed for the island of elba where i arrived the next day   152.46141448205628
if this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do   155.4200638303082
you are my son dantès exclaimed the old man   114.65676278307537
mousqueton heaved a deep sigh   168.6631322366788
said morrel shrugging his shoulders   152.69762658510686
the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france and also to escape the frondeurs who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes   146.84908633420613
my lord there is time to draw back said d artagnan and your eminence is perfectly free   107.47145112745
excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocket book or dressing case   110.60254419685222
well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever   67.44058972413184
what matter if you are paid for it   111.15673452642166
as i came into the public room i saw one of our englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from bleeding   211.0534789644856
on the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious   104.96390252892259
but we owe something in this house   97.70476901329903
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated   75.55668569648981
but of what   106.1387017315589
if you must have me descend to earth i submit   179.3882642946129
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head   142.13345217252967
i furnished myself with a light   75.98520258118131
my father and the baron d épinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending said villefort   130.3735969567893
oh that is not my secret   124.5206684127842
what does he appear to be   111.1541653558564
each of them had a ticket attached to it by which it might be recognized   195.0805164394444
from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anything   40.41386480870099
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property   74.3460493058333
unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber   202.37439197084916
de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless   186.8416100570238
noirtier s eyes demanded the nature of her mission   125.01711101111574
but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you do not speak a single word do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant   95.73818550647164
well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister s secretary   150.0395976534256
there was a stream close by and a bridge across it   12.311926185690936
yes but not against a strong dose   102.59768172252282
sir replied mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall   151.97875675613048
he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall   148.9341676874311
immediately he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion opened it with a key he had in his hand closed the door and disappeared while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder   166.90454205530753
and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out   49.164037567506455
cried d artagnan seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous   139.50468895079484
inquired the vicomte de bragelonne   86.60062866805067
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct   110.59065826497277
don t try to understand it you will only lose your time   122.09398744584605
it was important that he should be informed of what was passing   223.8787288213665
for a fortnight i had been at that hotel during which period i had cured my valet de chambre of a fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that i really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician   163.20672703409295
the journey chapter xxi   178.46267811660232
all the way along d artagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in m   123.56403887875582
i shall never swim again replied faria   110.57899086652841
nor i said madame danglars   108.16785531228535
and as those could not be sold by auction they began to murmur   218.46066588157296
bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired   143.5187745072483
this policy of louis xiii   168.35862579038505
his costume of guardsman in the company of m   66.99260675205004
d artagnan colored   111.35103789966178
he seized the inspector s hand   183.59756587872982
but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies   158.48899672321934
good day dear d artagnan said aramis   243.90082700558978
a last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them   55.407989740223
cavalcanti will bring without touching the money   90.38073550395168
ah cried benedetto his eyes sparkling with joy   141.09199717951114
and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table opened it with a feverish and trembling hand drew from it a small poniard with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade and then threw herself with a bound upon d artagnan   93.30324545451015
it is you who are not a woman muttered mazarin   155.5149204210141
and yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two jewels   182.78628268548448
he was a great man   58.33239350603275
but really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival gentlemen   125.60802385757533
but the woman left last night and the man this morning   83.80822749128166
i quite agree with you said morcerf   67.09596450933734
these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame   115.24193094594365
to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor   73.1550111221398
when we went up to the enemy it was slowly   19.87352772279945
i admit it   66.31015993158316
the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice   22.62934473787098
some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire   89.75976522705783
look at that large clumsy bed hung with such gloomy blood colored drapery   192.59236869031108
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not   151.40219750612113
we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post   121.73147763427282
now sir continued morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like valentine   109.12315745133303
there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure   174.06834692948144
so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more   116.58355003302465
no monsieur le comte answered the servant i think not   151.15892886724305
you are in no doubt on that score   162.65264490169292
you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied   74.44738737851928
indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place   130.21797270832752
the four others were french and wore the uniform of musketeers   152.78902848476386
since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further   85.26701472873175
i have not seen you   102.87118420726239
in short if i go will you go too   106.95423050514006
and what is the pay   148.50669981915348
we will take possession of it and cut the cable   6.802600453935597
all i seek is happiness   61.94150391947734
de chevreuse was at tours   122.20991567767717
very well said d artagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me planchet   135.12572358714635
no not perfect was the count s reply   31.5889195215141
that does not concern me   142.6671902679266
richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man   25.676179382120438
a written examination attests it said the cardinal replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his majesty   116.4479084554527
i worked at night also replied faria   162.16434935931835
arrived at the staircase it was still worse   175.3274552008109
that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shop people and the bands of mendicants reappeared   131.8369718734447
scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him   94.00824045078275
remember said milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin everything   201.78290789113282
you have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late now   136.6797689159026
i buy those horses he said to the groom   122.78446858854612
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle   210.27700415296954
well and why should not you be free too   114.96517234737192
as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general s words   189.83943301113356
said d artagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended   136.8578792992768
only by the count s orders in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads had been fastened a large diamond   175.64796617017544
monsieur if she has escaped it is not my fault i swear   63.666256670545145
cried the executioner i think i am dying   61.56158123360603
meanwhile valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed edward s room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little staircase   153.7258081597295
liar   75.72949262889898
and who now unable to kill anyone because his hands are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity perish   95.12983907236968
d épinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation   117.4038391420127
said albert whose brow reddened   109.71191429463855
whilst lord de winter turned to her with a glance which said did i not answer for them   88.91592521566503
it is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m   119.88016598299218
nobody by the faith of a gentleman   79.10834324781044
i have indeed   31.250050200811003
no replied bonacieux with a self sufficient air she is too superficial a woman   102.2282423710844
once on board we drop down the thames and in two hours are on the open sea   126.65150999978052
taste this and in an hour you will be a king not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france spain or england but king of the world king of the universe king of creation   146.28332412999654
but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you   88.0128798270243
and the cursed italian   59.38029334441861
monsieur de beaufort   132.72026040442836
in madame de villefort s room   142.24194822402526
but for d artagnan all aspects were clothed happily all ideas wore a smile all shades were diaphanous   100.12751749104905
said aramis truly you are a great man   101.63485184417131
edmond said the poor mother who tried every means when i call you edmond why do you not call me mercédès   153.92695733814227
that you found me sad but resigned   122.57338919499783
at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was   76.22992261136233
it was soon time for grimaud to recall the past   114.15172679087473
really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here   112.24951867224345
he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action   95.16615923929372

his fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever   72.71796797715174
the abbé burst into a fit of laughter while dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment   138.4638673938543
and as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house   148.9125406121883
no it is unnecessary   92.1852902189998
a ninny indeed   121.49843338024351
i have not your confidence   45.201933231445395
instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts   144.14644009377173
mademoiselle cried valentine   121.9214967038222
franz silently assented   191.68571041106844
40152m as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room   96.86074348078881
a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent   39.094608952323156
he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look   51.937700012666475
tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative   111.8797021476241
they must be enemies   88.61045410994701
no objection was raised and the infant was given up to her   106.33919207643085
and what did monsieur d artagnan reply   182.9784032033931
porthos devoured d artagnan with wondering eyes   120.58823376877908
the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire   99.15457278584587
that a stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and murdered ali   92.50988682615257
then turning his eyes from milady to the paper he read order to conduct the name is blank interrupted lord de winter   13.025858119595
a double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet   108.15114766740885
upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own   94.04956874196355
the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said you are monsieur d artagnan   114.0114429970311
it s somewhere in the chaussée d antin   79.82740884568238
it is surely not one of my friends   129.30576354681352
my god i am dying   64.0854286064268
d artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off   128.8580567959478
remounted the throne   102.51662903035249
there said the king that consoles me   36.12103506005292
could you have swum so far   133.52815078087792
morrel smiled and shook his head   41.85055798760855
no if you have heard me distinctly you will understand that you are not to die on the scaffold   98.30843583221545
said d artagnan with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it   132.91555679480444
d artagnan i have always loved you as my son   100.2303414964563
to poison   141.75321409185162
whom you so much admire received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold   131.81682953532567
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner   113.26915875439963
some gendarme   200.86062500498687
he that man   178.9943278681151
it was the only letter you had   125.33805118099258
all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stock jobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow   126.49292189922996
the cardinal spada buried no treasure here   107.2368657741891
i placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men   144.93684177511446
tell me i entreat   112.59892825901818
i have just made a little excursion to the borromean islands18   94.77488339133025
he perfectly understood them and undertook to procure for me a man s passport and two days after i received this to which i have added with my own hand travelling with his sister   118.20936880950825
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark   148.51760059271774
being the last comer it was for me to make the first advances   183.30399607448925
the marquise de rambouillet sends him his tisanes   141.00620568162995
he can t go out without being mobbed by his admirers   101.89088264769866
yes my friend returned the count   170.81121165291376
yet conscience remains remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh   145.16901190745534
come you do not flatter him   67.0540159163875
and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land   104.40971446019418
but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you   161.63950851080898
milady is fair you say   152.9007631761511
this time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows   109.39547545790558
better than that   78.0107374297363
the perspiration poured forth upon the young man s brow and he felt as if he should faint   89.73587383788623
said franz inquiringly   153.30681953321266
good said monte cristo to morrel who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which danglars had been the victim i have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand francs for which i would have paid a hundred thousand   77.47830636393928
as to aramis he never played   124.50324902992237
you talk very comfortably a hundred and eighty leagues   89.97269235474994
rinse the glasses said grimaud   111.09985309999453
to my offer of liberty he replied that it was nothing but a snare and that before he came out he intended to impose his own conditions   111.82634175538719
he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars   44.74300992242783
how do you know it is the doctor   65.72321490158262
my brother s servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed   113.452046198472
the woman who was here the woman with the embroidered handkerchief   84.86054250294538
my king said aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they can not make an executioner   98.78199033471645
feverish and excited i rang at the door   62.73697934509879
for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first which must much diminish the face value of your bill monsieur porthos and render yours almost null monsieur aramis   75.08994050368074
valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror   160.70323256828198
yes yes i see   115.48609932238678
insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong i sought not to shake it off   146.4868466659815
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought   51.238291126744045
and i i swear to you before god madame said d artagnan that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone   117.50294719535736
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you   52.35775284128684
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity   88.64910277876427
on the twenty eighth of october 1628 the capitulation was signed   144.97137862369328
there can be no doubt about it thought he   188.40081525010015
what rank did he hold on board   136.90214555175848
it was offered with good will said dantès   183.653377554563
to the champs élysées said the general   217.5419793615506
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands   139.990824444057
planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses   110.53990307537372
so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed   199.64278906128078
but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot   142.67121183503008
two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle   78.3987821743137
colonel colonel cried mordaunt you are betrayed   76.91270087834245
but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned   141.12646641019666
at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him   132.61606624189162
séguier keeper of the seals looks more than once for the bell chapter xvii   77.73905513283742
the illustrious planchet   116.92020101875025
the child went directly to him without kissing his mother   121.08930840075077
this treasure will be lost   109.27007617892357
and porthos turning on his heel made a step to retire   34.14731674488658
eugénie became uneasy   134.27476633137476
no aramis replied   146.9728996120075
de saint méran before you bought it   65.97463936849091
the englishman is overflowing with pistoles   18.832666412417666
and as during three years that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion   155.5140255756458
it will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit   137.20523493646257
more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever   145.4820855058079
you must know something about it   70.29150325729847
and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard   132.4248865192343
with one of the clamps of my bedstead   144.15065756509688
nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer   47.60016358503135
in one respect you are right for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today   223.3327134140534
bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after him   31.077920193369323
explain yourself my lord i am listening   175.92868810994622
milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips   137.2219396331959
come said d artagnan all this leads to nothing   147.73184618185115
i was much more really so two hours ago   143.3461758004397
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan   115.49254431341059
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter   2.9744400766818586
d artagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is   62.94819042592282
i wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence   113.86055053292742
and now demanded the count are all the forms complied with   47.12063038801044
restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered julie to monte cristo   141.81822995537965
they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired   98.05030346147997
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges guitant and villequier mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man   106.47167384458771
for hardly will the people of paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them   94.57307250885432
call the prince   71.88566098125486
baron danglars   71.52979173243415
do you say the procurator s wife is old and ugly   121.36166436627857
we hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the académie des inscriptions et belles lettres if we should not succeed a very probable thing by the by in gaining admission to the académie française with our own proper pack   113.79458127489923
i even think that with economy i could manage it with two thousand livres   83.26383007291477
bonacieux the one he had just picked up   84.74241114274845
perhaps he can not reconcile himself to the french style of living and might prefer something else   155.04022367867103
he alone would have any influence with them   101.25280609322014
please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you   136.8753606392064
it is so simple   163.9113116217892
she went to meet the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham   130.05632488631295
do you see it   65.31171699202251
we will give you twelve piastres for today tomorrow and the day after and then you will make a good profit   21.53113987903376
valentine uttered a cry   120.806324886669
well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties   113.49945821559577
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo   130.0277632162317
perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thrown it into the river   64.23986806257446
if she objects to your marrying m   82.71270545157957
they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose   66.09077359901741
perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of fate   119.8221627723312
andrea made no resistance although he protested against it   122.43257424572397
the same cabriolet which had brought villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment morrel rapped at monte cristo s door   82.26909414205738
beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage   130.74517164357795
thanks count no replied de winter   181.6577363932331
just so take it and go   131.5580279184241
and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids   86.38806451291956
be content i will do my best   6.602603553042584
let me propose it then said d artagnan   84.1458319512119
the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs   151.90561245512686
porthos and d artagnan roared out both at once   78.55589130443835
do you know that i was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the bastille   178.20282803811617
one only needs to be sharp that s all   66.38522591611908
have you seen anything   148.73111059138245
monte cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm   151.62316439599556
tomorrow this order will be sent to the duke of buckingham   136.78426609541341
that is to say when you have received my instructions   123.46818139026333
mercédès courtesied gravely and said that is not my name and in my country it bodes ill fortune they say to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband   137.142962765509
everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts   59.69375252457655
it is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good   123.92371092575164
i the heir of an enemy   129.74160972325
who calls me   62.10365524009033
the duke walked so fast that d artagnan had some trouble in keeping up with him   158.44806611475275
why it must have been the king who made you such a present   96.68809803437429
albert laughed   64.18926884060822
for the rest he was dumb blind and deaf and of unimpeachable fidelity   131.91374046471253
a circle was immediately formed around the door   113.8303174319775
de tréville and that of m   173.4629633637643
relate your story and i will applaud it if it is a good one   128.15855728128292
bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain   123.03255079413447
hola lubin my pistols   103.81959003618931
faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed   110.14055074362366
cried raoul courage   118.18118108914067
you believed me to be dead did you not as i believed you to be   175.15809155815606
asked beauchamp of château renaud   89.06708886382484
they are three superb animals   116.59338659542983
so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion   119.66249920203978
but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced   6.419132212943779
she was the widow of the marquis de castellane when she married de ganges and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothers in law was forced by them to take poison   73.15189880415284
your uncle   198.495542525327
then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest   159.29164403434544
and with regard to the past   194.1276705411974
my words have not convinced you   164.11124766388008
andrea scowled   171.4922985473698
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge s door and which merits a particular description   105.00957017774189
i feel it by what remains in my heart   103.00394159544551
quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem   84.84680167142194
immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire   119.39495973574877
thus louis xiii   18.19150134704435
you have described him feature for feature   150.5430725521217
major bartolomeo cavalcanti   129.30450517863622
then raising him up as tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he can t cry out   148.46099753381895
haydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors   107.90812061490428
at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string   74.32781959302298
is the king accustomed to give you such reasons   137.39803685880608
asked valentine timidly   89.42951920228323
and now said the abbé read this other paper   55.678191107050885
was it possible there could be two answers to such a question   108.04672498647246
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore   88.38181539982745
at this moment a horse neighed   197.06141324373198
and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind   186.22834442853969
nothing replied maximilian   122.6462686781457
yes i understand   56.38040496338204
but remember signor pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for   125.95263995355066
what hinders it   102.84666739071463
you could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling   84.23402470188607
on tuesday the theatres open at ten o clock in the morning as lent begins after eight at night   111.58526007300681
then he piled up twenty five thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the effigies of alexander vi   147.42150904861293
i can not endure his presence   85.56736523564382

planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of d artagnan and which d artagnan from that time made shift to do without   26.529800670675655
suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious gesture   127.68770643767705
then d artagnan told m   165.5543262141504

on the day after the morrow by eleven o clock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was   152.47736318161273
plainly enough   124.05164082547316

oh what a clumsy thing i am said she with feverish volubility   124.14545242146178
neither you nor myself but fernand   84.16858928442305
d artagnan took out the parcel which he had desired bernouin to place under the seat   74.31157940255068
it will be as well if he is not answered caderousse   83.31244178371726
asked the traveller to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted in a melancholy voice   86.82090401709975
thou hast no confidence in me   132.8225608757194
50267m my friend said the count i have still one doubt are you weak enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings   149.905448316734
when mazarin ceased speaking he said to porthos in a low tone never tell mazarin that i understand spanish or i am a lost man and you are also   94.94712153209159
because i am too young to die   127.23097748724594

i agree with m   150.46693679223392
the officer entered for the fourth time   81.01491079935529

the hungry friends followed by their lackeys were seen haunting the quays and guard rooms picking up among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with   48.56904914994283
valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but morrel s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them   156.78629405138818
he knew that there was a trap door communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the orchard   70.32538952758969
let them wait for me at the pomme de pin   252.79146382911392
said monte cristo you will see him return to you gay smiling and joyful   152.2401812333759
but d artagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of athos   66.72005293632725
yes sire and one wounded man   145.10319172762942
the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head   38.77079517587913
in two days and by using up two or three horses that s nothing   139.48321426079266
a friend   101.83205521792269
but if the plot had succeeded   124.34205559713133
i will go and tell valentine what you have done for me   86.15452910885597

very well returned dantès dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad   92.71938113457962
sir replied haydée the count of monte cristo my foster father has been in normandy the last three days   134.01942041126955
so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind   120.54304308792554
a propos add one thing what   156.03812827437847
inquired maximilian in a faltering voice   54.972784564003454
i will do my best to obey you madame said the youthful king but i have no inclination to sleep   115.84442173291302
i don t know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table   132.09812649819276
and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will   128.0429369760197
and peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of danglars   66.13320520042382
explain yourself my lord replied the prisoner with majesty   114.5225810520307
the aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of october   101.67761047159907
athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte   79.40897482478505
still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres   136.07856388019974
cried the young officer   134.6813648557823
continued bonacieux throwing himself at his eminence s feet ah how truly you are the cardinal the great cardinal the man of genius whom all the world reveres   103.025356160005
then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him courage sir   171.60723170719845
my dear raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked   57.018057098875445
he took his way toward the hôtel of m   145.00545420240405
scarcely had the door closed when m   137.15239380792192
if you know a prayer say it for you are condemned and you shall die   141.72124404151828
he passed over my head and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps   153.24084891243706
you can talk to her she so delights in your conversation   165.22203100082828
remember to go to the count on the 26th may at seven o clock in the evening   91.01911959131903
these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the count s forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt ali s blood still lingering there   151.28351796137395
athos made the sign of the cross   120.20473363275015
her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water   72.46900376712986
take courage vasiliki said he   120.93012303872787
joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased   109.67911491914104
do not jest about holy things my friend   167.85784794187114
30221m is it not so   202.01266013470882
his things and his bag are with him   160.20610261138762
the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for athos   171.19906715190666
it is the same   164.9544221450268
so then said he the letter was true to the end   184.23767853174226
a piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place   129.09352876584884
from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum   100.62555222057124
the four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of athos dominated all the rest   135.73168974844194
org license   120.65717761460272
albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand   54.75009781164939
keep up the dance then since he will have it so   121.08367885765863
from madame de montbazon   122.72686782990769
he appears to have fled by the window   113.39883516508127
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly   146.70993016181149
his tastes and his profession require it   122.72260193125138
i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest   46.90039656149061
he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation   142.63002621583018
then the thing is easy   135.73507636338917
and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos   126.52134055817989
they are alive that s all that i can say about them   117.44555019135382
but take away the young man   116.03333762985618
then he double locked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in bank notes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed to madame la baronne danglars   133.10332068229863
de tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair   121.16165699446825
de winter took us to the house of a spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots   162.27375076378033
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived   138.01555462607013
s restoration a visit was made by the inspector general of prisons   147.1967962140356
of the middle height about the same stature as his excellency returned the host pointing to albert   47.8132506809896
then we do not see those beings to whom you allude   155.36404094297995
then said villefort nothing further is required   134.97092902302805
there are fifteen of them   147.32970844883357
scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun   51.544952377983776
it contains the number of my new abode   115.57893417215847
no i didn t know that   151.13833180184412
i can not stay here any longer   74.63551365026305
de villefort s marginal notes   132.9545207110093
so my dear mother i am going at once to ask franz to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants   125.74387933889574
is what you tell me true   71.36811918555878
oh my lord my lord   62.27158133789313
lieutenant   79.51179783272619
monsieur d artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity   28.739760448490742
poor child   171.91821617588866
inquired charles rising   124.33748676849238
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could   106.55245240185705
we listen monsieur athos   60.03640362175917
aramis and i are very unhappy   74.2110239983491
it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked   142.31334449229448
but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven o clock of the morning in the month of january   107.38524358461537
but listen to me listen and you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief i am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon you   110.62516763956287
in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha   84.18341366088765
and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you   79.9375208175531
the host became as pale as death   46.79208342984741
the two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities   122.86450506318943
i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti   200.0759102516166
it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease m   132.17389121620454
you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a prelate   114.15602838678666
i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london and i say to you live sire it is the will of heaven   126.2696447163717
thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it m   189.5661362067109
yes yes my boy so we will so we will replied the old man   125.81240597715995
beauchamp interposed this strange man the count of monte cristo bows to none but the count of monte cristo himself   139.60845594361928
and his immense riches whence does he procure them   148.74100589854322
then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves   92.77049573277657
yes madame replied the coadjutor   108.18502232334698
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women   103.24198226933322
and you will seek in vain to evade it   29.984818711505696
yes said monte cristo i think m   134.03960958800758
come and rejoin me   43.31065505427398
resumed d artagnan not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead   123.88722938293274
instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your course you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend   129.18167859978277
athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst d artagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully   205.77966391464298
the horse shall be restored to your lackey monsieur   28.764332195708818
he took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the house   181.28632238248795
do you not remember that while you were seated on a stone bench and while as i told you mademoiselle de villefort and your young son were absent you conversed for a considerable time with somebody   88.82139856911147
still added he amid all this i have not yet been presented to mademoiselle eugénie danglars whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make   212.00798521722055
will you name him   39.46061692426406
yes my captain   81.85605239704167
shall i leave you   64.88588736357157
my dear father i think i already know what you are about to tell me   100.17023616066032
the fourth and last side of your cell faces on faces on stop a minute now where does it face   104.9989782927138
you must look out for yourself   134.19871857413966
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms   110.37790520226046
be easy said d artagnan he will know all before night   179.6876379990703
with these words the baron went out   175.3093749038108
my friends will be there i hope   207.38605771499505
those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious   83.8832703244363
the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage   129.59605846678394
then i must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my departure   71.43311219026484
the president rang the bell   99.46463534249266
well sir replied eugénie i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible   33.51081598194095
his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel   147.99675840510855
i knew that from the mixture of greek words   163.0859575313188
i know you now   171.30665216405941
by the torchlight dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes   38.28855540860846
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty   214.0896493566893
and if your wings like those of icarus melt before the sun we are here to ease your fall   114.34327819714748
a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood   46.69467259264927
he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be going   33.70119836158982
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise   129.49546120897335
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with you are either cowards or traitors   127.23532359834739
to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well   80.28563991220317
the coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses   66.4190453406382
yes i understand grandfather said the young girl   155.10582036184655
it is the day my father was murdered   130.26134019471723
asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table   153.80920937557528
my health is well enough said fernand clenching his hands without raising his head   88.4680885883389
do you know what he has done this child   123.51022777640527
the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as wasilio s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing   93.64498861073017
so replied de winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that white skin and that languishing look have not yet seduced you you heart of stone   124.36700760555955
and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action   146.07908200241923
one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville   126.3058321665899
jacopo pointed towards the horizon   89.72244294992659
d épinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations   111.58392514636184
true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe   118.39921993730013
now mancini was a nephew of mazarin s and was as much hated by louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister   124.96917549278086
merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure   93.92743361516725
then you will start after the queen   123.06288222777042
you are good and faithful servants   130.27179943201665
in a quarter of an hour athos joined them and at the same moment charles brought in a letter for d artagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered   73.00506180446641
speak out answered d artagnan   184.63724787410192
yes and i would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence unless from deepest hell   95.56010184964063
de tréville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as specimens   118.15584934817792
ah sir said the minister of police to villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by luck s door your fortune is made   183.6149593598886
the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin where they expected to find the prince   75.18009438276525
the diamond which glittered in the window at marlé s or fossin s shines with more splendor when it is our own   161.132938302522
this malady admits but of one remedy   121.75477785126974
and did you not remonstrate against such infamy   143.2328639247872
it could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion s words   145.94355863318543
madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you   167.6695306557691
but how do you procure a light   105.6789368392092
when i wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to i go to sleep   33.37098711959797
the countess bent her head as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts   176.75061825049315
the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist   136.78668755882143
which compels us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of letters   160.00244626441668
the fifth of september the extension provided for by the agent of thomson french at the moment when morrel expected it least was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him   126.31776850193665
do so then   123.50384966839827
franz smiled   128.86055790013432
as to getting him drunk the duke couldn t hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it   86.88740285084535
but pride but self love but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs   131.01085036911917
punctuality   96.22642779479816
said he approaching the cardinal eagerly   103.64058550316082
the novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said don t you know a gentleman named athos   112.44123451926079
do you know athos   112.62902209126463
you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness   193.99733475482554
and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow   89.00127738137611
this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome   104.40497498344222
said caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it   116.61041510305267
porthos placed his hand on the pistols   78.47154305391916
we are returning to his eminence monsieur the chevalier said athos advancing   62.452433119491594
speak to the governor then   118.66850493512021
then all looked at each other he was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart free perfectly free   137.69305617652284
d artagnan half stupefied without his doublet and with his head bound up in a linen cloth arose then and urged by the host began to descend the stairs   134.63174390380468
you have done since i knew you not only your duty but more than your duty   74.32703492007779
the young men obeyed pulling up their steeds and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop   175.70210311704892
but he was pleased with his falsehood   41.33898298847694
i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed   79.36248572221206
grimaud came rubbing his half open eyes to answer this noisy summons and d artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lackey   4.208309669810745
well then with the first money i touch i mean you to have a small house with a garden in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle   103.0269954579569
the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yew trees monte cristo recognized him whom he sought   121.6546053926529
a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and aramis   204.0566226022103
very well let us say no more about it   84.55520435290138
that is what i want   141.4913904002286
we have a king ten years old who doesn t yet know what he wants   72.40826497167768
stake both pardieu   169.00759148355786
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said sharp   59.33023628623819
yes for an instant i hoped it was so   174.98893783252666
i found myself again in complete darkness   176.37801008714013
it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars   93.29110135087211
but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us doubt   170.2453675197178
i haven t seen you with so cheerful a face these five years   133.27469145332734
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual privileges   97.96729553702536
count he inquired have you any relations   111.65207602743159
it is well replied mercédès with her eloquent glance   107.03533654381388
flints and pebbles had been inserted around it so as to conceal the orifice   156.13085982020763
so that this strain of the knee continued d artagnan my dear porthos keeps you in bed   106.9759754919051
the king himself   73.10580453260148
his cassock is a burden to him and i imagine i have had enough of mine   168.00544391596696
the two friends recalled by d artagnan to what was also due to porthos pressed his hand in their turn   101.70514647471103
why is it not done already   104.74167405022565
impossible you a favorite of the minister   114.49296672142957
people pay here before they eat   125.19093588738961
milady ran up to her apartment quickly   91.3461932718897
in the principality but not in the prince   124.65230319724097
this person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with flowers   104.28945895374582
he hoped then in a conversation with anne of austria to obtain some information from that conversation and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know but which in either case would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister   154.26919106043056
then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon   125.45821276552907
then cried franz it is hashish   116.66294460262328
he fell down this morning and broke his leg   131.8618091378668
fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth   141.91134384352915
he was evidently ill at ease   28.189552601914414
the lackey took his place by the coachman   108.32696757814747
besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a tank of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin   95.74813005916246
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken   137.4791499549556
said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents   29.791822383381202
he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission   176.4505922335341
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth   134.1156893537906
but for heaven s sake resumed aramis   109.28197358421497
said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth   106.87191434131962
caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abbé said can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself   137.63701387853916
i am not so much at liberty as you suppose   124.25910462380962
a mantle piece with two modern sèvres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each side one representing homer carrying his guide the other belisarius begging a grayish paper   124.81236606245336
monsieur she said i i do not understand you   99.47392381608513
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth   89.76774377064608
tell me what it says   118.12151514845054
charles shook his head   25.837110774688824
everything   136.32582594754996
you would expose the self love of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle   184.65048136766313
and she stepped back to retire   80.27274259807336
madame said he i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant   61.435833138010516
but you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with him   46.12802643210213
planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same   117.45671365981052
and said the prisoner what talk is there of war with spain   1.2758200884948252
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about her   138.04939751227096
it is a man then who expects you   187.31674842405351
now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club   138.55725285117424
besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship   172.52690758428474
well i follow its course i track its passage   139.23190404770588
as to d artagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive   153.93560524452192
oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort   172.97724816368827
my poor grandmother gets worse and worse   99.82398361266885
fortunately monsieur d artagnan is in our hands and you shall be confronted with him   94.95788992839493
that s good said albert with a gloomy tone   184.67916016581967
cried he throwing his sword upon the bed this man must be the devil in person   90.88281523493177
it relates to mademoiselle marie michon   142.90050084364594
at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus   126.09116793447745
athos is right you have my adoration said aramis in his turn pressing his hand   141.07715985251218
at the footman s announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity   90.60914876519617
now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities   53.69127544753402
said benedetto   86.64393775403533
he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause   196.33768554467383
is there anything extraordinary in a journey   38.34514050946572
demanded the baroness springing to the window   151.79284720189605
come come gentlemen remove the fellow   85.86719218877971
all right said athos   94.5519836008321
for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of edward iv   78.50251478319488
said la ramee shuddering   169.68101442333023
scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight   214.2924671725674
so i presume said athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you   150.07511497032104
grimaud can take care of the horses said planchet   46.12677668787022
bazin sighed   116.54897701841548
his fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young companion   113.82951594123232
i was about to give it when you anticipated me   137.04248977243822
these men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none   68.19634650328055
they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letters from the island of elba ought to have informed them franz interrupted himself by saying my father was a royalist   53.79389929216021
you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them   71.63644954058458
bah exclaimed monte cristo that s a fine reason to give   132.07803975009992
this time we risk our blood   123.3023831332802
said a voice   47.81375600401799
but don t sleep as you do all the time   112.5112328095563
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles   78.7831226850051
open   146.9820419993822
what could put such an idea into your head   136.1459960677249
the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel s keel floated at the foot of the crag   134.13779851700247
however to teresa s great astonishment luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening   120.69247097623335
that is to say with our enemies   189.83747843542528
are become our most dangerous enemies athos   29.588654866507298
he was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and hair as dark as a raven s wing   78.72013610052446
fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to athos to ask charity athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going   182.09359464706296
and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le curé told me it was just now   210.2401271614765
when the evening came i was so weak that every time i fainted i thanked god for i thought i was about to die   145.88440475289642
i always obey madame when i am commanded by so gentle a voice   78.69122066692196
in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter   94.24169044275916
i ll manage it somehow you will see   73.75127232647745
it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the storm   175.79585690149787
that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination   146.1734623949901
aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached d artagnan   164.98513961578817
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter   121.4332223468077
and now he said may i inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me   108.24813748523688
i have to pay a visit this evening replied he   144.11876712119667
i shall never forget his countenance   172.8731467023342
mademoiselle danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor   136.15484188947477
answered aramis as you see from heaven   115.09023931400701
let me see said the count   107.25195701638877
there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are   155.1313363419422
but athos was a man of inflexible determination   92.38304004825625
all these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket   84.36153971079068
instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour   49.65940655284483
ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host thereupon   104.72337094023752
monsieur returned villefort i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation   154.04714953125156
monsieur said the prince turning toward raoul i know that you have a letter from my sister madame de longueville   120.39290452733721
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter   139.29233235187394
and they hastened to quit the palace followed by bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments   142.60295168678493
well then your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove and die at the end of eight or ten days of pains in the intestines sickness or abscess of the pylorus   104.7198105208808
certainly i might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart   157.35826372528027
he will be condemned will he not   191.8306026090998
the rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more   137.65941291393915
after the siege i shall enter the house of the lazarists   126.73617666788074
no said the paralytic   103.21709754930853
for monsieur de wardes   105.62495535000808
and the wife of king charles   169.2984824083452
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascon s uneasiness   101.76075660345747
but to you d artagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend   76.19694840058202
in five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one   71.61911469106289
fortunately he is a cunning fellow that friend caderousse   146.5983972447943
he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to lose   67.63777921326928
d artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of mme   123.79793129256441
you tell me of m   125.9215204884757
that you knew it and i was not informed of it   186.759127542846
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even tailors   186.1549818965753
not a word of what has passed   120.98916718691167
as dantès his eyes turned in the direction of the château d if uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey   137.3464943626435
but leave us i pray you   154.97504914728188
sir beware of driving us to despair   33.97336916474583
i beg you to do so replied albert   117.55505538937557
because there is a little secret a precaution i thought it desirable to take one of huret fichet s locks revised and improved by gaspard caderousse   129.93725022995514
you will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of louis xiii   176.5316988613199
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health   121.00283660995284
you had the nightmare that s all   115.00049645936603
andrea took the pen   159.798148154289
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and felt all her resolution return   133.9714028989237
as for me i can only repeat may god protect you and all dear to you   70.12516672658847
nothing more just   112.24474315561831
he might fail but something must be left to chance   82.28574038354161
we will share said porthos   127.39917819838364
noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me   112.80649073120496
debray continued when you receive this you will no longer have a husband   49.18563110155907
this must be then an affair of importance   74.51927916060643
demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word   69.32331774460465
if he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him i would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other i would have run my sword through his body   114.92471719278095
well what is it   52.09393946746123
my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive   75.96241711384248
said she hesitatingly   38.409533037249005
as for you viscount continued monte cristo to morcerf you are more fortunate than the government for your arms are really beautiful and speak to the imagination   122.79463421394881
all at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes   185.7573864833991
here i am ready to give you any explanation you desire   114.56274523597831
de rochefort enter said mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced   98.06722168292326
is it pressing business   120.10311678012715
when he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped   99.45342535695609
nothing said the king nothing   44.238325026833934
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he can not make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a mésalliance   121.10931722258157
albert said beauchamp with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and talk   130.89485582228855
he turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance and holding out his arm to him said come i will not abandon you thus   178.68737029460618
i wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover   61.17904802162688
they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly   238.78940864768458
murmured caderousse   62.883332279836445
a tent was erected for them near that of the marshal   156.92304264359984
she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times   53.1500551400816
i will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult   113.47119031563098
royal honors to one whom they have murdered   125.01807535266502
well then did he ask you who is m   154.52598138912796
asked d artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth   211.38350716303944

0161m villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself   109.30476701085185
you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural means   123.59314160202817
by the streets morbleu   187.6200510526513
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound   111.94654045470806
tell me at least to hope   125.15636021326586
and planchet took his place in d artagnan s suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed   83.60233547339752
they both came immediately m   44.71823280697993
excellency cried the cicerone seeing franz approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace   150.83880832495348
the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned   91.17050778604957
we no longer talk we rise to dissertation   122.53916404553554
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over   60.987593652682904
felton started   164.63914832196073
o reilly you are my prisoner   174.18116280437982
that s a pity said athos coolly   180.94947482246874
come i am growing an old woman   159.45710348061974
for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room   103.44007828984775
be at ease my girl   90.79545325767985
in a pate for example   171.46719694747685
bonacieux d artagnan turned toward her   27.812894558174037
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been   139.21449165259958
god is always the last resource   122.64600873561544
two ladders were hidden in the clover field   152.03154936654417
there s the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights   85.76602378365456
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety   144.42765755735323
there are the prince de conti the duc de longueville the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon the marechal de la mothe the marquis de sevigne and i don t know who for my part   116.22817610742312
oh i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother louis xvi   103.18649541233441
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo   90.01675064034832
she ran to the window and opened it   118.36370756889696
have you seen the greek mistress   201.95060275221405
i could not have thought that there was an englishman in all england who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom i was speaking   54.789903320984315
i saw notwithstanding the darkness a shadow which approached my bed   76.06881007355419
call for help   125.58931246612383
let him find it out if he can   95.83098132578091

if any are missing when the fete is over i shall replace them   75.41597197701164
then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him   95.18768416453142
have you seen d artagnan   98.18829349297025
now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away   168.3580468905381
adieu my sweet haydée adieu my sister   28.051521933110365
if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger   118.41508606716856
nothing good replied porthos   142.5783531376855
in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man   255.0435064600651
you have doubtless heard the adventures of m   83.15618706696388
said barrois   153.12852024432792
felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her   95.44815052537373
one evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water   106.50990696697065
but this is trampling on the weak sir   158.54123280002918
then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart   145.09782505254736
if these five men give themselves up we gag them   59.49361698446403
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing   137.01614760441242
this woman is certainly a great liar   144.35072986176715
that someone has done society a great kindness   35.688391274284825
yes my lord i hate him   56.03720699667364
it is not a law but merely a custom and i pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor   85.03513141154181
to you alone then may i confide my sorrows and my hopes   66.97964942089618
we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy   149.21268090258218
i shall only have to cross the river and i shall be in a foreign country   137.3886401052032
it however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty a zealous catholic no doubt shook off the charm for through the door he called hold your tongue madame   115.96068519192418
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them   125.52664268123289
i will restore you to liberty this moment   73.39907188122851
but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto   94.86426258069989
and from that moment the sieur de la coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues   152.2250771296749
excuse me sir returned raoul blushing still more deeply i know no more than i did before   131.42526542439
is it not true antoine   101.60011203066152
fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercédès although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart s blood   107.51050514997583
yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room   146.2481672867637
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme   168.92459984751858
only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit   142.8229528067555
then i have your leave sir   131.34111191645331
yes yes said danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good   92.76428698413679
however be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows   82.9221839875673
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles   89.71847089125035
cries were heard from the camp come down   136.60990469679726
but it is something that you believe so   139.34728319440742
oh yes said the count   131.00923842542898
40154m then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife grinder   57.80618541598747
this is the point of departure   138.8072608466436
that of athos carelessness   79.50020716742918
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good   89.75345279638836
but count do you remember that the 5th of october child replied the count not to know the value of a man s word   89.96782855922588
and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by tasso and ariosto   99.2013254450631
and your slave   100.34266975773423
blaisois obeyed   184.917506200435
then said monte cristo you went to him   156.34113651098352
we were coming from syracuse laden with grain   82.59131605443753
the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine s room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same moment   127.77339169894468
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond   114.46621501854173
kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape   274.57390115823864
today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories   151.7763740333152
ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered   54.185380752661395
and where is the governor   181.74236966978987
you said prince did you not   130.8149070656309
otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed   136.33780985204592
yes monseigneur said d artagnan   101.45244586612253
devil take me if i taste one of them   108.90836831191504
now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things   113.24027318928701
i mean as i love   94.62054762568573
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs élysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure   85.08858784580194
she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others   132.93682051038277
she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless   155.61397440541424
but he did not succeed   28.194359457594928
he carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in england the ambassadors of denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of holland who was to take back to the port of flushing the indian merchantmen of which charles i   103.45214395374589
and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you   150.00363076020952
not much only two inches an hour but still it rose   113.0184872215432
fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a step   142.86217854111015
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her   163.73709425514505
my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned   96.95307988312923
there is no harm in that   115.80944179806463
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character   144.87197474527977
my dear cousin i think i shall make up my mind to set out for béthune where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the carmelites   192.53837404686342
franz was deeply affected   83.59645332821282
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless   88.03775684021348
lucien half smiled   129.00273324498056
there are hours which last a year   220.0644963290673
aramis less self controlled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard   57.356865587106576
planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse   118.15640916509403
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady   77.58338211816975
you are not monte cristo   69.9057025083849
a small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one half per cent it had originally paid   77.59449707041487
my lord said d artagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the comte de la fere   81.31623341121939
on saturday at six o clock   172.39792559472454
well then try   75.0277619301745
his brow was more pale than it generally was   108.69955318135526
and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so   51.17015591967002
reflect and decide   54.0579366575068
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queen s letter short but explicit gave him the clue   100.14028983887917
i agree with you there   88.36839079112023
the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen   167.41034847316052
in all 287 500 francs   74.38763488586503
but to leave the country to fly together to reach another part of france where they might live at ease because unknown money was necessary   128.20367948302624
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke d angouleme were called the petits maitres   85.724603290836
cried d artagnan who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him   189.77912446771882
but porthos i do not see him   59.16275970410755
and very princely added château renaud   94.40636650723658

first my stranger of meung   140.9464525974585
for instance you told me to live and i did live   81.35538577377633
what do they say   93.3100651379768
but know beforehand if you kill me or cause me to be killed my precautions are taken   104.78890806002173
sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family   158.0492997080187
chapter xviii   148.67388631114588
and here is a book which contains the ritual   78.36274696572026
yes indeed said porthos   165.09801931792103
by diplomacy and success in arms he became almost supreme ruler of albania epirus and adjacent territory   126.42867031484406
well then if it be so are you ready albert   94.1537908116796
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them   150.7519645329678
i left half because it seemed so bitter   101.96125399704688
we have already observed with what rapidity d artagnan seized the expression of a countenance   120.21384287398801
and they mean nothing new   156.75030762763646
at these words the count s paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming   92.44392420049604
what do i see   112.73904983076235
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself   43.60826319196343
d avrigny and antoinette his niece   37.94666741499107
is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon   107.48275841779258
poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much   86.98696295768083
i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden   34.959656243168524
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him   90.27771259003529
silence about the queen above all or you will ruin everybody without saving yourself   92.30372014740249
he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad   162.17504805362609
i have been liberated by someone   128.081400969807
and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form   90.1238392075622
the bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of fire   98.14984233577286
i can not i replied   96.27419977337708
cowardly court   65.80387987525488
before he had taken ten steps beyond the door i had examined the house on all sides   160.57879126636152
that is a totally different affair   27.45595543774057
he took monte cristo aside   149.95369799718262
the truth   116.19986435319154
with paris the bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein   105.34213169676764
monte cristo wrote i die murdered by the corsican benedetto my comrade in the galleys at toulon no   117.65193603653923
at these words with the most gallant air possible d artagnan drew his sword   110.45815953582196
this singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy   165.33574504437357
he sought to open it   63.01269883180096
it is said that mazarin who though a cardinal had not taken such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of austria   148.3031110768655
but the dead can not return their fire   91.04119148345515
this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos   117.12093502898516
each had his own particular visit to make   130.30003997033782
20347m excellent murmured monte cristo to himself as he came away   177.7018825609798
if i had wished to widen the breach between those whom monsieur d herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder i could have spoken out   140.66297646483488
the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat   98.84356627076616
are you not rather young m   90.33595066986211
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much   109.76004712468604
and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion   163.53848976988334
talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos   100.7717700302008
there is the subject simplified   118.36907837067118
three days after about seven o clock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to sèvres   101.24989349752877
emmanuel and that his business was with m   154.13101560604605

i am condemned   120.19254653814144
he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it   167.55327884011876
do you know this island of monte cristo   124.30924707387554
the notary looked at villefort   70.8535765998736
i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather   172.02381143517152
cried he to the coachman   50.69195899646162
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for d artagnan s embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that i know you with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent king you my dear porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as d artagnan   75.09783954813659
the soldiers were playing or sleeping   112.68641392244187
still the same story of superfluities   113.79146957785758
villefort approached noirtier   110.59674658056477
in ten minutes after the strangers had departed franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert after the manner of pliny and calpurnius touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators   70.47951416568418
oh said dantès timidly what is the matter   63.41498248169847
was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one   130.02965471794704
ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might creditably make an excuse   154.34452759430084
coquenard gently advised him to be patient   93.7263723770408
she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty   125.91015016842763
between six and seven o clock the road of chaillot is quite deserted   184.13190872066468
i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease   182.06977362800887
when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan   67.86711960086677
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé   158.7793855889233
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it   188.1768261285136
why to accuse the man do you address the woman   171.9900613779039
the third attack chapter 20   116.22965184305156
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh   69.88253502830884
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better   112.16252210842421
you see we had each our mission said porthos   106.01339224518358
then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance   160.8844875822102
the effects are drawing near on the contrary   110.68725037785237
it was evident he had his orders   134.06943462410774
you speak as though you had loved this young dantès observed the abbé without taking any notice of his companion s vehemence   86.40673513576088
he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board   72.50441026866716
i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of cabanis   124.9047390622907
come sir said comminges make haste   128.47755414623543
and i have the honor of assuring you that i killed one of them with his own sword said aramis   173.56462831167363
did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba   147.826551041865
at length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend   209.86416692297985
athos did not trust this reply and he resumed   130.49132874218242
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse   121.83769347955882
d avrigny continued to look at noirtier   65.20637278082103
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her   165.16740750335327
if i obtain the situation i desire i shall owe it to m   82.91507191101886
i understand he said you confess   151.05627820560437
i remain here a day or two arrange accordingly   83.55308171910863
and that is exactly the snare the king s enemies are preparing for the poor child   173.27467636733195
and now you may ruin us all   93.62634081057428
and in his enthusiasm he struck a st   111.16218947405108
in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations   95.32078266989669
athos smiled with ineffable pleasure   101.42560499426277
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament   58.13115641855854
but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond   68.26522636050281
one must replied monsieur de bouillon sacrifice one s comfort to the public good   128.26072993087928
keep the 50 000 francs you have left i give them to you   135.90232142637095
your voice is that of a young man   36.02418104616687
was i so badly lodged at rome   99.34090211981291
fortunately i don t know where he is   72.06425383073156
but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was unable to complete his work   157.80688386610092
i do not patronize m   105.12159648812587
what has m   150.36444784735772
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris   140.74357992259033
two miles and a half   101.27435967223452
come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered   92.76987390211596
which i received this morning   67.29344299544519
oh that s very well young man continued m   192.2701602135354
why of downright starvation   141.04248501417356
let me meditate and consider   125.79941799559158
the smugglers chapter 23   87.00009171227362
franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company   67.75020807076095
handle the musket and the sword my dear fellow   251.93994745236256
the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely   111.3134352954746
would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills   81.27754440122382
dantès redoubled his efforts   114.33877133632248
this is your brother madeleine   146.00794787096217
a sword for example richly embossed which belonged by its make to the times of francis i the hilt of which alone encrusted with precious stones might be worth two hundred pistoles and which nevertheless in his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for sale   161.3752193483707
thanks thanks said monte cristo judging from the steward s utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it   134.27762562974635
athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings   91.32669496023443
here you are   197.33808099423953
carlini flew joyfully to rita telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her father to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres   155.3276181580916
the fourth as we have said was dead   151.78909184395457
bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man   117.03869735900834
madame de villefort followed the litter in her carriage   212.4012869864282
ah it is certainly you   129.36192485328118
now if you please remove your bandage   95.39234281824719
in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of memory   52.312460679620045
he was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor   151.80948184108644
said julie will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy   57.06135621449977
well i must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent fellow   160.27168454913814
athos made a sign for his lackey to approach   198.85943296883954
none of those interesting adventures fell in his way   68.9955410488337
the inquiries soon commenced   195.18589984740856
they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms   75.42794225617125
these exploits had gained luigi considerable reputation   127.41058199925199
the poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while milady was reading with her lynx s eyes the very depths of his heart   121.62043234454373
don t laugh my friend   100.20148924770524
summer balls are fashionable   131.4955536919748
this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais royal   102.40885421717111
he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa as nessus the centaur carried deianira   139.96767750574554
the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle   120.51899084389956
no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended m   72.61363100537453
d artagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him   75.93144992926369
danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror   87.04531641698267
dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay   69.90857854986943
to speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in cash   121.68951027861276
arrived at the end of the lane d artagnan turned to the left   134.4608195559159
you have not deceived me   84.17217014158149
that s my opinion too said the captain and i ll take precautions accordingly   176.63638838514805
ich bin ein deutscher replied the prisoner   71.2371052278345
so far as i can judge i suppose this to be a quarter of my father s revenue   107.1810754154084
at neufchâtel as at st   175.00695640048912
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court   136.36750237285077
lucien had found time preparatory to the count s arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars   102.39762455206414
but as i am very hungry pray allow me to eat   136.23660170523365
then you yourself are one of these marked beings   134.62401633827403
oh d artagnan my beloved d artagnan   138.80886874337816
do you hear that madame   123.54962798294936
you are afraid are you   128.59525991329147
i in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him   148.1938040275109
he began by asking m   85.23813554386611
yes said jacopo and without any hesitation   102.08072345713842
we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard   43.54344463201612
then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priest you should have prevented benedetto from killing me   94.24539905772883
and your business is that of a confectioner in the rue des lombards   133.66995329340196
on going home the two friends found a letter from athos who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day   171.34103448370593
you know me well enough   163.66281143011867
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name edmond dantès   140.56979916461725
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him   126.11833019851005
his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings   140.09600431474092
that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about her the queen s emissary to the exiled duchess a musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king louis xiii   208.5921575531434
he is not a prince   126.13811525368838
i shall live   100.18432327423503
yes i know it   136.17192529569473
and what is your deduction from this compensation sir   29.43638954284772
must i take anything with me   206.93151958549672
and i can t travel on my savings for in my twenty two years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts   73.82762000465209
come let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly   123.07013302930147
all at once he started   95.40406024518117
the joy of the king was lively   60.11173783335731
if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel he was not mistaken maximilian started as if he had been electrified   169.96936207602147
and how much is the pension   65.28619342542878
i saw him from the window madame   104.38545532649087
it is miraculous   78.67728198796875
the officer followed her   120.49064237198337
d artagnan then returning to the officer said sir have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say tis by his eminence s order and that i shall await him at the stables   139.4626611588358
you shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated host   139.78520511976956
and my poor grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him   49.88972465000137
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground   151.7583399729241
had made restitution to the united provinces   158.1615969364333
on the contrary i gave you to understand i think that i adhered to the princes   81.0231174915613
athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around i the comte de la fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before god and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground   196.6460824130634
he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy ah ha he said here you are peppino   152.84788211546157
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat   91.48311976662416
said he eagerly   123.04465881348723
kill as many as i could my lord   159.21793417862418
all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which i am not deficient in   77.18790585325445
there is a carriage coming said château renaud   85.0589215944767
he is in a hurry   43.39223757194914
i was expected at sharp midnight and i am late   81.28475448247629
my shoulder quite burns   183.17618534803455
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so   165.89644049597115
above you there is the king   75.1563804226522
only for him it passed more slowly   144.60415849116657
bonacieux yes there are traitors here   84.38403043836499
after their departure fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of mercédès led the girl to her home while some friends of dantès conducted his father nearly lifeless to the allées de meilhan   172.99394772068
milady shuddered   86.00157388285831
de château renaud in pleasing a woman   72.73197354143221
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms   13.244256546920525
he hastened to his cabinet   156.88960407813687
the heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that spada the rich man was really the most miserable of uncles no treasures unless they were those of science contained in the library and laboratories   70.2557839153514
who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him   68.58241363945356
and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king   123.08784713406294
of debray   90.34764388934038
alas said hermine doubtless it is chance   56.093838478172295
while d artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors aramis had joined his companions   101.56816982729275
you are not angry with me   159.00309453428568
there was the king who made war against the cardinal   149.9988154350561
i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness   80.41681232422292
good answered grimaud   162.96986087696388
three days afterward pistache was found dead poisoned   68.88051916457239
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andrea s intrigues   136.29241667399592
oh the train is well laid   122.54145143656321
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck   174.54578147356716
in the first horseman she recognized d artagnan   97.7802542083352
then said haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristo s question and albert s answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills it   62.817100572062145
therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf i shall say it and you   93.70247698091707
nothing my lord   98.67816875791048
a deputation of two or four people   113.93887807878524
fair said athos is she not   162.41848096081014
my nurse lives there   92.34288998543047
madame de saint méran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health   172.07977325133038
and whom i advised you to strangle porthos said aramis   112.17410569645503
quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal   191.52388531649473
i say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resistance   99.91307796836182
all this will not advance your outfit said athos   125.70495854217063
mousqueton stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage   163.96684717037567
panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left   172.79274722348256
the name of one of the four friends is caderousse   154.6314225442742
hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it   183.33388856777583
la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus   152.87455644863968
asked the general   127.02815963044476
danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke   24.66157883890712
i valued it much said mazarin giving a last look at it   64.0802365000585
d artagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile   124.40057266329761
weak or strong repeated milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul   149.18568478427545
that is all i was obliged to know and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars   112.10601283851659
and then the baron hastened to the duke s chamber   106.23848573838305
and as a last memorial he looked round for some valuable object you will add he still sought   110.23415611921524
he had till then forgotten the date   124.30633831602499
at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall   61.87132664163944
a summer ball the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur a travelling carriage entered the rue du helder passed through the gateway of no   18.56722706572853
she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently   183.83071694371887
and here is your fowl   120.15386476559144
said groslow   89.79430211339633
we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the spaniards who were on a height with lowered muskets   120.81895887449137
friend cried planchet   171.34330423316703
i could not repeat the signals   136.52317230217017
what do you say to this mother   183.94463368502812
the other day it was barrois   125.22506082534393
now resumed grimaud i ve only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest me   113.83330243185992
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one   46.219429767379694
in fact at half past eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawing rooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen   160.26968367102302
i fetched 2 000 francs   123.2744449211421
but really no matter go on   130.3344416787394
mine   112.68211213976272
he asked himself what had become of mercédès who must believe him dead   181.863549304529
what should i care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her   140.85841456778914
i really never heard a person speak as you do   3.690821695983658
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it   84.2297306075427
what time do you breakfast albert   106.63964854679372
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject   131.0713593967306
the king entertained great regard for my father who had fallen at the siege of arras and the uniform was granted   67.0359247396147
said d artagnan rising and brushing his knees   161.91933742578232
where to   62.16597274613754
certainly for he told me   115.54160961218746
there was profound silence   93.32991397015458
and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto   106.33896004693227
will you depart will you depart if i give you that you demand   103.30727878913699
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all   144.3978271252616
madame danglars   59.23524034351839
short and stout   21.650434180461332
and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of dionysus of old crete   110.47611666185772
you understand that interested as i am in this affair i can not see it in the same light as you do   189.3520101567652
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise   101.12271346039219
he returned a sign in the negative   41.44939450391638
alas alas sir have pity on me   41.24026552359476
and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a lateral alley   137.34638488163742
the comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red   95.2198682128972
go from hence to blangy and from blangy to neufchâtel   109.19561696654195
the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf s narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion   203.3947076588653
you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve you   68.89725766580187
as for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly   92.95756832388953
d avrigny alone had followed madame de villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried retreat   14.433706020435949
dantès saluted villefort and retired   51.27056175992307
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance   181.78605948100204
asked bertuccio   171.43007250948423
he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast off cloaks for mousqueton and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master   130.82412008837937
you were among them you were   144.53757513046043
on our honor as gentlemen   60.47110830033025
then answered albert i am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse was   220.15077348934273
this last reason appeared convincing   101.05591878330436
she broke the silence   96.05291676658635
because you would bring us to ruin   76.1437015070715
fifty cavaliers   165.13560897619283
dear grandpapa cried she what has happened   83.24679629376448
nor can i see how i can be a stumbling block in the way of your salvation said d artagnan   124.8206592211243
no no my dear edmond my boy my son   134.02159305275978
but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him   78.59849125832753
your hand dantès   106.65303569298342
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner   224.94248692403838
i am well i want nothing   118.76310095505015
and the young man who had never shrunk from danger shrank before monte cristo with indescribable terror   199.75611939554548
in life our greatest preoccupation is death   63.96628185826649
by following it we may perhaps discover something more certain   96.75939490538696
so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures   116.25440051759078
mousqueton grimaud and blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street   149.74307389794177
no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not come   81.5423942842342
if you drag us both before a tribunal i will still say no my daughter is not guilty   53.27839834596561
that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are   134.41362063691602
in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves   81.62407275424687
his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he was   91.70420059468408
yes murmured flamarens lowering his eyes   89.69432636417173
in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind   143.0941642273988
she renewed the order relative to the gascon   85.29991252893305
the clock of the invalides struck one   175.06944492552307
i will not contradict you there said d artagnan   71.87355582395861
but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos   85.88044679327055
d artagnan has abducted my wife   196.4846346344276
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted   135.61688858966417
the three friends were likewise greatly delighted   84.20142727582669
at length i heard the well known noise of the door which opened and shut   125.55336783034537
is it too long   114.00341853165632
am i to consider this as part of my income on account   127.3378755923578
about a year ago i talked of retiring to a convent   96.99441738662544
sir said planchet you must know   71.16632535104269
and the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed   40.857347051700984
we only said he would escape   164.28892861662
he rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shuddering   174.89964006133798
ah said monte cristo taking it from her hand   173.6198248501439
de bonaparte   140.284737936825
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage   74.422861567982
cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard   48.7275670704791
you see it makes a very respectable appearance   12.299840172312457
come come said danglars to himself now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted   132.18028967259824
we have an instance here   181.47392028985564
inquired grimaud   0.9547669978755664
fighting here are you   51.37530412470066
that in triumphing over england he triumphed over buckingham in short that in humiliating england in the eyes of europe he humiliated buckingham in the eyes of the queen   129.0027593220465
what do you say monsieur   125.03498236385089
madame i serve the king   150.12050257119262
she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her   176.8718179375627
the little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet high   137.97782594856912
let me live   186.82852038795477
for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction   152.56324726700188
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed   163.45627884560565
once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post horses   69.7917685164891
the two travelers knocked at the door   57.33168819111376
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman   166.1996706103583
take some she said   188.65524188106718
then continued milady then i collected all my strength   131.97230635417696
felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable   67.1917841571094
he then endeavored to re enter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman   148.90972384752712
and if it be what i hope you will do well   132.02568025778777
then i confess curiosity mingled with hatred   79.65983048915959
with an intellectual and animated physiognomy   190.2623829371621
you incline me to think so said the king   86.29450604196066
de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens   39.53744383489044
word of honor   127.52215879438276
yes repeated the executioner   83.40660605789066
they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism   70.02976023241874
cried the three musketeers all together on seeing d artagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger   165.3476954991392
what is my daughter doing   103.14120145763042
ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears i see that i am condemned to die   105.20844887454561
the king is but a man   137.18985324011146
de salvieux my brother s chamberlain   36.88725369553865
he might have become a bishop and perhaps a cardinal   82.96570031077002
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voiture s works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutor he is a poet a true poet   170.3664751078843
does grimaud know him then   147.20535320451134
is he alive and at liberty   187.36044559037583
bayonne   129.7769719247327
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear d artagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you   147.1798261997561
oh sire exclaimed the duc de blacas m   92.30915648446648
whichever you please there to the left   182.02796924109776
he is a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely in case your majesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me   177.5599564318025
so saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood   127.13365985720083
then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts   179.48473890492699
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos   31.139722198167064
athos shuddered from head to foot   122.53316345810416
the second was called the comte de la fere   95.74979846114113
ten men for monsieur de comminges   119.67523764527273
repeated dantès   170.49028518335174
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors   51.29607357111591
you are among friends said athos in english   113.53821341679507
we are coming to your aid   196.1761731550176
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes   232.0353599119535
and are there no cardinals that can fight   110.64956083861662
my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession   172.15225161920193
and i say to you fabulous as it may seem i tell it as a true one from beginning to end   53.52944709253578
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminence s commands and d artagnan unsealed the letter and read m   145.55298654167456
how do i know it   164.20908732928757
but the water was icy cold   110.17879536570138
will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you   103.65172117704489
the mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before athos   48.818924760150765
the young girl looked at morrel   184.762659534413
why did you not invite m   164.6659944424039
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says   51.51228438698478
a signed statement chapter 76   87.490745598113
you are then in possession of 900 000 francs   147.48415792094517
but your companions   146.2501275759899
he found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughter s grave   124.37306377711833
did you not observe his despair on the journey   102.51974830788889
de villefort s hands then i shall be contented   202.80081206963447
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me   184.42228738550494
why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert   58.85298479457948
my very self replied planchet   103.03831329558164
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting   58.445018534308424
that s the first time i ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot wounds with cat o nine tails   130.7641761891351
read then   106.46836287342262
but there the confidence of d artagnan stopped   90.51258545880421
and what is that   132.65560300454752
now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear   136.7821506755699
well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain   103.70324414140939
yes happy as myself said he   111.43589551002258
the morrel family in a very few minutes the count reached no   188.99502098148298
and be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to england or the continent   242.91939803408616
you madame   114.68029956298281
he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto   122.63375305783188
to imprison him monseigneur   171.96828611782655
the result was that even if the king s troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other buckingham who only continued in the isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the siege   52.6126537858126
well i should say   245.37593952557566
nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever   104.66319155101374
she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king   144.1905316020388
and d artagnan dressed himself in an instant   94.15903543103545
i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence   93.10702764297731
i shall use it again upon occasion   156.02584798725564
your mother   70.63053684909644
then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile   62.46271296711713
then after a slight hesitation she resumed   110.61603383443035
then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo   123.67088923614456
the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea they perceived a large white sail   163.45016608770075
this dear friend said d artagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me   92.53882561283933
oh heavens cried beauchamp the minister quotes béranger what shall we come to next   146.08205006549372
it was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in paris   94.24108993985365
monseigneur said d artagnan this was what happened to me never mind never mind   126.84536599254534
noirtier would have left her all his money   51.51873746082226
do you think she loves this italian so much as they say she does   85.57542145035985
it is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard   64.28531858048993
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes   100.5827519201936
afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave   5.722538082303913
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crown piece in the dust   74.58176998348777
you do not understand me maximilian   102.97987890757065
the rendezvous chapter 39   143.2992492817997
at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the stranger s face while his own remained obscured   151.58964923761735
asked villefort rushing from his room   51.02117732346808
the inspector turned smilingly to the governor   31.134074857608226
the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the half closed teeth   57.02457423572134
i can not thus in a moment relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a father s untarnished name inspires a son   17.951651872099816
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone   115.25009743810485
a paper may be lost   96.15784733613552
you will put yourself at the head of the first   136.08490209119458
the queen who was scarcely less afraid of monsieur de beaufort than the cardinal himself and who was almost as superstitious as he was made him repeat word for word all la ramee s praises of his deputy   24.26934487927022
noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal   91.12859488251078
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical smile only guests   161.86385482076219
cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to m   180.16320377688288
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury   112.65394191860706
ah sir replied mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you re enter the army   104.97257539958753
they passed silently into the breakfast room and everyone took his place   125.47532895019734
under that pretense you run against me   134.04084429424705
bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world   103.36895542007959
come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends   89.06479351464323
i will denounce you before men as i have denounced you before god   176.34995660135615
at this moment the door of the dining room unclosed with a creak and porthos perceived through the half open flap the little clerk who not being allowed to take part in the feast ate his dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and kitchen   120.84517254432456
besides milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys   110.99060458330268
i have not enough you said when you had more than you before possessed and you committed a third crime without reason without excuse   61.99644219886494
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way   158.03371328376272
in a game of tennis   51.71334359064011
the woman kneels on a prie dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl leaning against a chair weeping   108.43209784594626
i mean m   70.90652441432053
standing before the chimney was a man of middle height of a haughty proud mien   45.98963093519983
at this moment nine o clock struck   25.582945758679926
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket   128.32773338693852
about noon   21.771864381958736
monte cristo turned round hastily and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered pale and motionless   164.18628556424966
the count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life   180.47231443740407
armentières on the banks of the lys   120.9637697070224
mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you   124.69521972791601
he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray   106.03216054520706
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window   74.44825915838095
yes answered franz   102.51075409678805
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls   195.88562481476654
and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded   100.05069049029323
not at all not at all replied d artagnan   78.4813994835792
there you are beginning again to ramble to talk again and again of the past   110.20461183144218
what is the matter sire   91.04299600720404
that if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent   100.5982711421861
the first opportunity you have confirm her in her opinion   64.03458610117079
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets   67.67487600911085
he had found the pates good the wine excellent   101.53068082588133
the husband had presided at the abduction of his wife   147.17838191231232

this money was for her   102.8330915072242
sign an order for his release and all will be said replied the cardinal   105.16422471615498
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friend you can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction   132.10495390875488
to what purpose   71.55636556892422
but i am content   174.86319241703006
listen to me he said or rather look upon me   147.79308642247696
they then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants   160.97419474214246
yes since madame de morcerf invites me   182.42539126429818

my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed   153.2190172726844

the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d artagnan   106.99255728024659
a fête was so rare a thing for poor anne of austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her countenance   162.95107730585255
he has at the request of your father opened an account of 5 000 francs a month at m   160.7964491226852
good good   70.13035222089574
no more ships   140.70247048313064
it was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her   128.30222001301382
he was with you just now   130.41184279926193
the fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy   119.18246562075909
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals   135.12864387414672
are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades   73.68116550571307
and the four friends seconded by grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and detaching itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch   68.93967941830833
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice   84.96483038520405
very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the door   87.89574184982622
said porthos protruding his lips with contempt   149.7849944328017
the father s   106.77313022910616
his eyes remained open and menacing   141.12475827982854
said d artagnan in a low voice as soon as the bolts were fast let me get out of the hôtel   88.45490056251292
and tomorrow to the wheel to the gallows   84.08571777989499
on his left was porthos whilst d artagnan was on his right   85.02979728908107
i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated   77.56114339305653
faria has dreamed this   134.09897697982868
i know it and appeal to your penetration   96.19337284358117
no but it will be said caderousse as surely as dantès will be captain of the pharaon eh danglars   87.89687238853494
this athos was connected with three young musketeers named porthos d artagnan and he stopped short   121.62706677964675
do you hear how they sleep   183.63571940030718
the cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers   123.10279938824843
the two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events   66.17817048405882
alight planchet and inquire for i confess that i have scarcely courage so to do   95.34367999399562
ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some things i am in need of   116.73471024834656
there s my hand i promise   152.8300453709941
then i thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose i was your accomplice   60.23358119321407
i heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted charles was killed said cromwell staring very fixedly at mordaunt   142.4210059049215
it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration   94.56772765778076
six o clock   91.27575309025471
very well be here at midnight   87.79902740556983
don t worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to smile   93.29523287449496
who could have thought it   160.21525494287636
the wife of athos we have now to search for athos said d artagnan to the vivacious aramis when he had informed him of all that had passed since their departure from the capital and an excellent dinner had made one of them forget his thesis and the other his fatigue   195.69072928916745
those must have been ten weary years   212.47014114064166
said he with the resignation of a fanatic   62.080618481821396
d artagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more self control had banished from his own   148.01244388900537
he repeated his question   113.68131283237103
however nowadays there s no need of so much heroism   165.23072487232682
however he regrets your absence extremely   88.34640491195927
in the first place said he i wish my lackey placed with me fully armed   81.41291827788477
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet   120.26849780162397
is my father here   5.937973773220008
expiation chapter 112   91.66641455627531
i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your father s favor and that i might do him justice   89.7971408572387
the 5 000 000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand   63.38948101232674
your excellency will judge for yourself   130.74425997188308
said aramis suppose the master is a puritan   122.94123446298497
come thought danglars it is the same old story   102.09592974007958
who could these men be   176.57893203712473
it is not so bad for a novice   44.58259311615096
monsieur el comte de wardes   128.9258039632292
her pretty face arrested my attention   74.30305776506016
presently there are not a sufficient number of people here yet   97.26352400402307
they rose about eight o clock in the winter about six in summer and went to take the countersign and see how things went on at m   83.13155192894547
not their application certainly but their principles you may   46.256131930974234
for were the gentleman a montmorency and the diplomatist a metternich we will breakfast at eleven   137.75479696994537
he has just gone and i am sure he ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went   94.80137077213195
no she said   195.31514038600352
but first write your request to dessessart   81.41959242572807
ah said monte cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance   112.16655438834772
my dear athos he said i am going away   122.50222996173203
cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria but at the gaming table of the baths of lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers   192.8254379438527
this is frightful   184.09747241948
come come give it to me   76.83964812783822
i should think so a horse that cost 5 000 francs   104.25388813650912
who could desire my death   137.9925922800981
i was called to see him on his dying bed that i might administer to him the consolations of religion   137.9876032110003
everybody is looking at her   186.50512455102472
but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention   174.68207038558091
how can i avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable   144.49551882657028
the presentation chapter 42   126.37044544217
i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday   98.40702410321296
this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentine s absence had done   115.23303600885923
how young this d artagnan is   159.4216311351583
grimaud himself understand   154.33691728729133
ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching him   106.34777887078246
if you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me the young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit may obtain his pardon   182.64434056037004
there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger   106.35844122339189
arrived at ryston d artagnan assembled his friends   183.538792455695
which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists   107.4222403397124
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled   190.82067714084397
from the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect   103.3723557010833
but what then must be done   32.020230592773046
come i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold   133.5498461592387
the fanciful exists no longer in the east   65.86080129925695
sir answered a voice from the depths of the earth   130.71548032405062
he told luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it   133.5086719296447
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged   176.66905236367512
their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right   117.66105580806993
i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless   73.65771869955785
and how did it happen   120.85106772009085
he glanced mechanically towards the piazza the scene was wholly changed   167.90796838104453
what have i done to you   127.10821159352493
you are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great fault that they have not yet had time to become old   18.812579194638474
hunting for the equipments chapter xxx   114.91969477260568
andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card   161.61374408004446
i have the key but make haste   200.04688380214264
inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him   66.93691494200479
at ten o clock felton came and placed the sentinel   84.65238606633048
added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish   136.34184382397873
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door   81.33976347797675
why i meant to pass it over to you my dear athos   146.9073285255622
higher monsieur higher   33.8190469021324
villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five and twenty paces than have heard this name spoken   175.68632396621993
d artagnan smiled   121.44852178782219
stay where you are i will tell you   138.6314828781499
everything is possible   103.47630867626538
de guise   148.06452085826794
besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress   86.13222517064762
you have not by chance married a protestant for a third husband have you   112.42959875206085
a learned italian chapter 17   48.14302661036962

whether by chance or mistrust the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all day   125.54220123691746
he exclaimed as though a red hot iron were piercing his heart   133.01592197678565
i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter   166.29913370933193
he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out   207.5561207291379
which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her   116.21936448808414
buy some provisions   139.88241456416284
they all asked together in a low tone   106.41546843434895
he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished   142.41219611296765
a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort   129.5294054905126
i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes   13.299076219315168
i recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea   102.27307607638218
monsieur continued she turning to monte cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us   108.11945153112305
the duke signed   175.8225528010475
nevertheless said d artagnan the people are bowing very low to this person   46.00797004212855
she comes from martinique so i call her the beautiful indian   114.95069564023525
said d artagnan there are two of them then   118.29875086710705
d artagnan seemed iron   156.13962770789604
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch   161.29781471830208
d artagnan to wait   133.38812494255376
milady called undressed sent away kitty and shut the door   47.08653988676723
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of laporte   78.79376635781006
after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night   144.27988288091328
de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused   156.73534070796373
well sir said danglars in case your proposals which do me honor are accepted by my wife and daughter by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled   166.97891122911167
murmured villefort   100.33677112390114
and by whom was your wife abducted   83.02070400715706
morrel i shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence   120.1346939084536
he shall see how a gentleman can die   61.710211541631494
what do you prescribe doctor   115.75558600149364
you will sell this diamond   25.936021296200977
i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which i was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road   152.1018949849776
nevertheless i have remarked you   140.25824718827414
the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano   143.65230549977923
oh no my lord   88.47862024642964
and you know who i am without doubt   123.47269909995322
adieu count said the abbé d herblay   109.83003845352101
and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree   121.6826274628604
well that s what puzzles me replied danglars   169.20253741482807
but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into   196.97956673482363
why on board the tartan replied the sailor   128.80436250744629
this is but a trifling inquietude i know but one that may be appreciated   134.01711940226707
2 impossible   160.788476830486
ah it is no then   106.97220720213907
all without had heard as we have said athos porthos and aramis called and had guessed from m   195.03728779437287
two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient   194.7444853753801
he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word   72.47434891557076
so preferring death to capture i accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution   128.9144522033955
de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio   182.57194500328035
sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m   125.41316300988885
but by our holy father the pope cut it short for i shall prune you in my turn i warn you   106.46154374886403
i say that she was my mother   157.58013864930717
undeceive yourself comrade you are not monsieur de tréville   98.15090083456995
captain or mate m   134.6270197047206
after every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges   55.19146924365954
say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him   101.343213191307
you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us   136.14992753541136
one ball struck the head of the already wounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of d artagnan   95.3617206266907
so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever   112.44950047286292
still further in spite of sword thrusts which weaken and painful exercises which fatigue he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels one of the most insinuating lady s men one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day   118.69756857057344
i do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost   48.01548414664653
ah cursed priest   219.58627765169155
yes quite   93.97633789778125
in the name of heaven my lord   124.49468717227556
faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death   136.66399173043382
you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life   92.45809115560132
la ramee began to be uneasy   201.3779449098348
your majesty on your side said d artagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been   112.04287726034904
it is a brawl   173.41441888963254
are they all full   106.11070624001718
and you will submit to the reparation he may require   114.82463481858959
what a noise about a musketeer   59.24066920303917
in the queen s name   121.59219468350123
at that letter the old man signified yes   152.44486682262277
as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction   159.34414024992518
there was little change in the cardinal   114.04597137503794
a second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling help murder   133.52426536544817
monsieur du vallon i commend his eminence to your care   158.0898506312919
no indeed sir answered raoul   50.733438794731015
we both are servants of the queen are we not   129.57830441160928
he described to him his interview with the cardinal and said for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket you our friend our intelligence our invisible protector accept this commission   127.65769370164824
this thought the house of morrel is about to stop payment bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done   125.53517416587471
at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet   58.122873164218575
for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence   153.52132073415896
then continued athos we have another reason   142.40418241043682
then turning toward planchet he made him a sign to uncock his musketoon   63.22497101637148
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself   108.50582734232675
milady smiled with joy   110.93238310684679
he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property   198.3399971805201
for brave men are very dear to the king and the king knows that his musketeers are the bravest on the earth   107.17018281500754
the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example   97.3977962350989
morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste   193.4354033371456
what s the matter   160.62593240748146
the two men followed the company and on leaving the faubourg st   93.53610764505727
his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve   34.66853203220491
captain said felton this is the person of whom i spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to france   162.54275480806214
said debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars   83.58121117672479
and a brave captain of spahis can not risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world   21.8594991615458
the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony   166.39015482611285
the lackeys followed armed to the teeth   117.73480811587268
oh then i remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamore trees on the borders of a lake in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror   60.85638712392533
said madame de chevreuse with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own since that time everything has changed   101.40616278569553
put your other hand here   121.83549121416767
most decidedly said he men are not equal and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers   98.27169043813535
mazarin coughed a little   71.25737610420045
had you not better repose awhile   133.17622468888777
all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel   95.50526449307344
the salon was filled with the works of modern artists   162.03684047186044
silence monsieur   100.62829497964564
read the letter again from the commencement   19.17219980974174
robert le diable the pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the académie royale   124.86184829919172
we never joke replied peppino solemn as a quaker   114.84937784483279
he has arrived from amsterdam   71.69147890110901
porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage but with the eye of a jealous woman mme   106.19699311436113
no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more   189.4426323337741
and he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror that athos eagerly seized his hand crying are you wounded my friend   120.40281043508341
this d artagnan   164.14928558650837
monsieur had just retired and the youthful louis remaining the last was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle a game which delighted him much   90.58441274351955
i am for no one   143.70067852709667
i can just suit you   81.39750107667734
chapter lxix   134.46998860867453
and what is the news   135.3045073206738
why really the thing seems to me simple enough   126.29729228207958
nevertheless it is quite true   145.64456361373766
morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say here i am maximilian   126.46072149450194
they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer   56.244233754881236
only continued m   131.8132402780228
you mean a mischance   114.33166207753453
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling   108.9357734090134
we will snatch some supper   140.88509915757516
i loved her therefore i slew her   1.5544068267297177
the one who gave me being and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me   166.11254621847127
d artagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between porthos and the procurator s wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped   230.3322133603437
he was supercargo   133.09001189874266
the procurator s wife shed a tear   205.16444901337024
i have not and i can not make three copies of that letter because it is sealed   152.31528395608217
and you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his fee   162.15162860544459
no your excellency i had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the abbé busoni himself when i saw him in the prison at nîmes   75.39837832999484
your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us   119.80189467596492
i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self examination   109.55690210820003
it was a model of taste and simple elegance   201.144621813764
the flash extinct all remained in darkness   117.9560787289016
but shall you be allowed to go into normandy   102.97133295728403
asked the bandit   45.52734970622926
now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter   83.07148638321459
another hope defeated   201.5974569677739
ten would have destroyed him   30.76834435591546
d artagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black hood   157.0070576332293
do not forget your crosses   130.6007922040037
i showed you this morning that i had a heart did i not count   44.784362986506636
at this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard   226.59943032842568
be satisfied replied d artagnan   133.97558285512937
i confess i prefer the convent of noisy   104.80813999139036
how my friend planchet   129.53377430942535
as next to the queen she was the most considerable personage of the fête she was received by the city officials and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy   83.95151811488874
the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar   56.875949883566086
the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me   38.1303897707446
as for me replied athos to this recital i am quite at my ease   37.3398191706347
i was conducting some friends musketeers one of whom by the by had a dispute with a stranger a man who sought a quarrel with him for i don t know what   186.32253655567007
content with making me pay for my hat   124.88807393152288
listen said morcerf if mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families i am ready to agree to the arrangement   125.6254988822685
and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity   121.32585123525816
are they going to put him in the ministry   121.38233049679407
20049m august rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the old   110.43804399329517
2 2 600 000 in 1894   82.72796479716008
she was thinking of something else   100.22584063764349
he was a man of twenty five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining   136.81280780611976
at this last thought mercédès burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony   187.4787565308734
both commands alike   132.90907590636834
he promised to be back by eight o clock and eight is striking   100.30187712657622
she could scarcely believe in her happiness   159.02368041892277
of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death   156.22696743609384
nay madame   82.57554779806519
noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot   170.05235146929374
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment   110.19324342150121
the king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing   123.15966166788934
one minute that knife one minute a single minute and i will restore it to you through the grating of the door   12.537680079436598
wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us   159.7776696274127
then they fear me   161.43830952686713
they know my habits   92.97935595346627
like women not like queens   90.56479007073976
grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his superior   124.73298856736534
fire then   59.567107473899966
but that command must come from the queen herself   177.49010907134368
and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and d artagnan more than anyone   20.688395096221726
designs by decamp as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa but more poetic   73.57076136168331
what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god   189.23662159862232
at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells   129.62107522821935
but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintance in your own country for instance   189.2448352794185
then tell me haydée do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life   57.48094025141415
meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi   143.32191414355867
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey   130.34147602132617
and yet what   132.9626813785006
do you wish to go on the water sir   148.76347933621122
shall i call on him as i pass   113.02329534647173
i believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his   55.75150417727139
they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it   63.0725934015358
i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him   155.76622152901493
gentlemen i will see the king this evening   130.23931348491308
but how to take them sire   54.7957540361918
indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit   69.98195812970638
really monsieur said madame de chevreuse unless you are the devil in person i don t know how you could become acquainted with all these details   95.84785889952127
the first squadron moved off   98.84499065805934
hold your tongue hold your tongue madame   111.01934693395287
have you no particular commands to leave with me my father   135.52597128167594
he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous   84.23203278740002
there there midnight sounds   153.8649211342313
they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me   143.4045298246937
but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut the obstacle compelled him to keep his place   43.20519212710195
and d artagnan pushed the half stupefied mercer among the guards saying to him you are a shabby old fellow my dear   141.62838082087325
it was easy to ascertain this   115.92529876400499
i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance   141.1840442754472
albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword   175.20873723672653
the poor boy wherefore   142.60719236884643
the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances   154.6058948568483
but one thing i can tell you of which i do not think you are aware   81.7317672100557
he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them   164.6694049975396
but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me   172.2979140119764
does madame de lannoy know what was in that casket   161.04324795251523
you know something about him do you not madame   126.8409176850022
villefort immediately despatched a messenger   150.4777810893856
lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went out   134.6791360573547
do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at jussac   119.79294838485353
a clump of trees concealed me   137.38213174842747
the maxillary muscles enormously developed an infallible sign by which a gascon may always be detected even without his cap and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather   58.67124926653641
see see   168.4275556932569
30233m good   125.5649616708449
and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended   126.95559277211328
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel   60.05556909809323
i have the means of making myself feared   55.46860197007933
for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to one s destination   37.604786514774815
have you   66.49847743306717
the clerks gone mme   58.434802964917026
do you need money   97.13897700178184
she came three times whilst i was a child to my nurse s house   189.89859370353795
the king smiling turned a few steps back   64.5016872428586
i thought i had said porthos resuming his melancholy air   98.13317848985866
no sire   140.98445911222612
his palace was my paradise   157.87109140296835
40294m at the moment when d avrigny was returning to valentine s room accompanied by villefort an italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m   98.96170781750206
you have been free to choose your career observed the count of morcerf with a sigh   94.81974963585014
he has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him and when he returned took nothing but a glass of lemonade   111.09677485471049
but four hundred what   73.67380466057843
curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito and he was recognized   117.41558323951259
d artagnan followed them   129.18377942000387
i like rustaud my lord   84.99443118947923
well in my turn i advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear monsieur groslow for i can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it   111.48771145831972
had d artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character   38.31222927103414
caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea   149.36537718882292
who are you and what do you want   121.34073570814476
on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password   165.49798703960886
madame you are deceived said porthos   104.04775563249073
cried d artagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he   152.1355052088224
come how shall we decide   118.48961687410575
caderousse s knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry   96.93401542544827
one might have supposed him thunderstruck   91.02160197222284
50219m there had been no prisoners confined in the château d if since the revolution of july   165.11390616997875
the deputy   116.46821077753677
brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them all   148.09322024117793
i am tired cried d artagnan sitting down   188.14700660975552
can he be afraid of this boy   109.9795226745571
but at crèvecœur aramis declared he could proceed no farther   58.71788980077165
morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it   170.6887524721434
patrick went out   135.25374694732776
that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders for god s sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve   80.00814724496942
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england   95.61482919893186
she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty   127.9573143632534
then they allow the lackey to remain with him   149.99323304464258
he was a man of twenty five or twenty six years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates   127.09459194140872
he will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion   140.4675750902959
is this that bonacieux   114.01806513312563
they made all speed to come up to this gentleman who appeared to be in great haste   97.03423684045559
no sire replied athos   140.52586366684795
is it to your mind   111.38950442309975
is that your opinion d herblay   234.45188722226612
believe me to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that man   147.66937854462927
four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded   173.39597842332574
ah maximilian i experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet i exclaimed forgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather   124.15407034360304
he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness   123.8515800012768
yes that disturbs you   66.74715750565456
why good lord   132.40982873534014
the count s first idea was that this was an artifice a gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater   85.08798955984143
in three days i will tell them who i am and they can not fail to let me go   39.85331904037321
said d artagnan do you not recognize his highness the prince s carriage   112.17394043674233
he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces   67.76771754694349
do you not understand   205.72394352459156
between honest men such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary   95.51455423129516
his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercédès exercised over him   34.60479675802867
are there then in england two men to whom such an epithet can be applied   113.39985651936152
they are two hotheads the one a gascon the other from picardy   144.96680688750476
i hope to be captain without that said dantès   67.5889441838099
delaunay in which he offers to purchase the good will of the house to unite with his own for 300 000 francs   155.5301132959326
two of my good friends lord wilmore and the abbé busoni   155.45870849921633
once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already   31.760661227440806
the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days   184.72016509847714
in france people fight with the sword or pistol in the colonies with the carbine in arabia with the dagger   153.99836852182207
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts   155.0893352854048
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word   157.52721234961706
how should he have been otherwise   158.68981134866743
she will not hear what we say   40.443923487730615
he escapes us   98.85062272838712
monte cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared   175.35342903738487
what can cardinal mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as richelieu to act as we pleased   97.0695090011472
hear me said the novice   78.3686991060373
because i happened to be in the ante chamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance   145.73048458700467
john felton i trust your word   69.61107871714574
i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended   116.73897610054111
retire within bertuccio and tranquillize your mind   152.25556379765
and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin   68.55709790447617
then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in disguise   219.9914272771832
so much the better young man   136.22360068745286
i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down   109.9951880531498
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable   68.40947604958866
but sir said hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by m   84.53929742661859
ah these musketeers of yours are very devils fellows to be hanged   151.75147979373637
but you forgot to leave me the key   125.51281983526066
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites   147.86849014128498
it is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the cardinal   171.83951910510945
and he is very rich   89.46540065871464
which would not prevent me said d artagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it   101.4385698536768
he uttered and reflected for a moment   135.9447053762262
but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receipted the splendid diamond   33.7021494483957
aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces the man ended by fairly taking to his heels and disappeared amid the hooting of the lackeys   116.07567200963793
i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said he   213.3052125509118
a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword   90.34384273168533
yes particularly if you follow the instructions i am about to give you   171.45857176788869

have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers   207.0232651857669
you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind   90.40355244199766
now said gondy there is a communion between us   28.402974732041883
so much the better for i have expended all mine in chartering a vessel   163.86844874574814

it was for this i had annulled the lease it was for this i had come it was for this i was waiting   134.97475507769147
mercédès let them fall and sighed   199.8927634805105
50025m no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated   108.96972829679828
a second time he was disappointed in his expectation   63.793395346090165
my friend d artagnan interrupted as i don t understand english and we all understand spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance   58.89473663369073
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness   108.79853047725496
but proceed i beg of you   45.2434658077368
oh second father he exclaimed thou who hast given me liberty knowledge riches   182.5769656843242
i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher   95.69298749305122
and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic she said but no it is not for me to be the judith to deliver bethulia from this holofernes   164.21581411765692
to marseilles   78.58493913085044

have you any other guests in your house   90.21651322510404
friend porthos said d artagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and i of my captaincy   138.88019910208791
but you will be resigned my friend   93.38690970822938
but with the duc de beaufort the ducs de bouillon and d elbeuf   211.57431444897588
whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free   56.550331822790554
that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham   137.24043232676718
and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him   100.48538074951348
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him   59.112847431254956
a carriage waits your orders and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go   93.38021321913942
that s another thing said d artagnan and i should not mind waiting in london a whole year for a chance of meeting this mordaunt in question   58.43802810741856
yes i offered you escape   204.03246738577838
everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment   96.43597249980681
well what do you wish me to do   145.13228073918364
our friend will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be concealed   18.4323077984222
on account of the famous luigi vampa   108.54066433356587
i may be besieged in my turn and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master   133.0644353345397
and you sold it   94.32510300367257
besides he doesn t know you   63.182143381948215
you will say then to my good and faithful parisians continued anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive d artagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire   144.2784814000295
i know what i am saying continued the marchioness   106.94825930222243
no certainly not   49.80284712235604
oh i take everything on myself   112.47513852081366
the host insisted   100.34691304492185
we have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared   114.14411174880529
at the same time aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb english charger   167.11041645791516
i enclose a draft for 5 000 livres payable on m   152.3051994193075
he has done wonders   87.850783642887
ah madame said porthos in the most melancholy tone he could assume when we are about to enter upon a campaign a campaign in which my presentiments tell me i shall be killed oh don t talk of such things   101.0809890593771
but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle   84.41719753147208
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming   66.91801405571951
and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos   89.76293354299702
exclaimed d artagnan looking in astonishment at athos   18.906799178387345
valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer   117.49559883385957
next day m   116.13454224101605
the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together   175.7108136122751
monsieur bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the piazza del popolo as i ordered you yesterday   81.75951620685598
indeed i imagine that mademoiselle danglars is as good as m   114.55217879185007
it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself   131.80008476210344
about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage   55.12448119676246
his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtier his arrival at marseilles and interview with his father his affection for mercédès and their nuptual feast his arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the château d if   163.3594414812818
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian   166.69360706822638
and you know said aramis that it was our friend mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overtures   79.52993255119708
a young priest with a simple and trustful heart performed the duties of the church of that convent   32.31379536810378
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh   80.40946088163912
he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened   167.87392992045736
kitty drew a little note from her bosom   104.91584639668068
jackson replied buckingham   129.4284966969046
it is du vallon and i who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see you   171.30564913212842
that depends   61.642725553335715
felton remained standing motionless and undecided   90.9451897842839
yes i understand said valentine   96.07873121956206
aramis was right   14.891949084397524
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so   64.48064999439771
to the dungeon then said the corporal   22.164524882579258
suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed   153.7788078776125
cried d artagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm   93.69213201777443
no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilian s situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise   64.34570795148161
it was a letter addressed to you baron   31.583547567085517
you are old and obstinate i am young and wilful   108.49288573537231
two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul but aramis protected him with his sword   112.94723573656192
no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans   155.59584047594652
30225m monte cristo felt the arm of madame danglars stiffen while that of villefort trembled   82.95489444087438
mercédès remained therefore by his bedside and m   83.0595894906871
monte cristo took bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the steward   55.95536413525408
well you stand well with m   36.06316939380123
has he taken off his doublet   231.71267802982192
and to me too   113.96714473044189
each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passers by through this egyptian scene with its strident monotonous note   202.04036843328933
said porthos but i don t like to abuse your kindness   131.9496971664016
madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying what a singular event   130.80184880091446
well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and to night they have sold you for two hundred thousand pounds that is to say for half what is owing them   225.2517956381031
said porthos admiringly   109.00240838379263
well said porthos replied d artagnan   110.04649082191992
is the deed of sale ready   36.848485924909866
that of my betrothed was stay stay continued the abbé i have forgotten what he called her   192.10167741098658
said he this has a bad look   110.63013588408025
my lord one last favor   67.01319375532759
the balls passed and whistled all around him   113.29444460341593
if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything   145.1496023651861
monte cristo looked at the room   197.08602980552988
only she did not respond to them   40.504863991246395
have you slept well   137.23702507832053
which can not last interrupted comminges   173.9305393677528
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier   14.790236849997711
in crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived de winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation   134.75757933912385
i may have been mistaken   84.8856701162874
was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphius s rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horace a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch   112.10891866568937
ah exclaimed d avrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery   72.28717005646286
monsieur mouston said d artagnan i should indeed condole with you had i not at this moment something very pressing to attend to   92.3343108504262
what game shall i find there   63.43250361357955
be it half a million then   149.59942988216736
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty   125.2670320622166
turning impatiently towards her husband madame danglars demanded is this true   168.7977201001505
every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion   101.37608860110913
noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out   154.7180556391944
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels   196.23430258192656
anne frowned   167.48671247699895
cried madame de villefort it is really frightful   128.7497069066207
the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on haydée seemed one of fire and blood   128.1890339443608
then read for yourself   44.986330280816716
grimaud dictated   92.71881814218432
oh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me   91.42529379708417
two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds   76.72028561417815
the soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him along   128.98338529029456
and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk   142.61459386065775
an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms   141.33980694936207
are you alone athos   158.6154846861541
do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmond s misfortunes   85.13899383984588
and we say proud as a gascon replied d artagnan   161.4420995146733
but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of st   112.90635885534984
i have not said adieu to him   154.62545079736572
morrel yes   116.30314587331137
as he spoke he rode toward the tall horse to the man of importance and his valets   175.08497833902345
search search   66.45469213038143
but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind   82.78821748639764
my god my dear host tell me if anything has happened to him   154.64631397316865
dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor   98.29323006218473
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain   146.42783613893928
do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast   27.644291088031395
your wife has escaped   172.3072682946707
he ordered the carriage therefore for eleven o clock desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the hotel   136.77179797680827
should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and i must do my duty   120.26434699867372
and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in work   177.73992885751682
with patience one must succeed   177.57409428562312
what has been the result   202.28668599778115
i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life   62.971248513004895
the abbé shrugged his shoulders   92.75106069711458
he would at once approach valentine s father and acknowledge all begging villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts   79.06012398018188
tell me he said tell me what you want   169.6060501467032
and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank notes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about 50 000 livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all   72.6129194149483
you may one day be the captain of a vessel   142.23234264137452
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france   89.60101620676136
it is that there was with her majesty the queen of england a gentleman who when i pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy   34.209660764163615
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape   168.19921066743183
quick the ladder   73.38068235857574
allow me to introduce my friend baron de château renaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ de mars yesterday   202.6727640829527
it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance   81.55055029131583
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway   128.46567964342916
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring   38.1519356049193
that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated hanged and made away with concini   81.29033535374202
the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the parade he had already three inches of steel in his breast   134.56690602402264
why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond   81.69438422824628
athos you make me shudder   131.0879899583154
and they all formed a circle round the fire while diavolaccio disappeared   128.62737573937824
one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there   113.0691089314574
50099m yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had raised   122.01079560815748
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no   86.80805787166085
monsieur d artagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign   84.05617683157952
cromwell smiled   156.3777237508861
andrea blushed imperceptibly   40.97091284096608
the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul   97.4429092935921
a handsome young man three or four and twenty years old mild amiable and well made   121.89210613146466
so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark   202.98648364169503
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood   97.23605519924492
cried athos and laughed aloud   147.36722428254262

milady seemed overcome with joy and made kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de wardes when he received the letter   103.33013929092272
the young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground   59.43003610321618
my lord you have abused the royal power which you have almost usurped   130.46399793982104
at the bottom of that staircase lies probably the cardinal s treasury of which folk tell such wonders and we should only have to descend empty a chest shut the cardinal up in it double lock it go away carrying off as much gold as we could put back this orange tree over the place and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came from not even the cardinal   75.79189554348196

whereas four men together make a troop   152.31580648730886
the executioner   125.48988135541164

beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you   157.31424522124283
murmured milady   14.864088350834365
then how do you hope valentine will escape   168.86893488215833
and how many men had he with him   92.26540131856649
all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it   106.79945197264156
the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner   172.2731768707869

you have ordered your carriage at eight o clock precisely   122.08496545671338
the young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock in which she counted twenty three bank notes   172.77172808682403
or his mistress interrupted d artagnan   144.13449600755743
and she fell into a chair   124.13613512944033
i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies   122.21238101453037
grimaud said athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their hands   151.80549824703562

this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal   157.0107303381567

porthos come with me to the left   134.19808955963708
and who is this cerberus   105.08896677840933
athos was pale and trembled in every limb   33.948539768761066
i shall not sell it do not fear   145.61370783195161
no sir neither of those   79.99746754907699
as for you you have acted like a barmaid   217.28521012635431
it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project   92.32308283090791

i am lord de winter brother in law of that woman   150.03492605892572
it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion   111.13176170914986
where do we go first   119.27097897244178
signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow   110.0072775706284
well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal a gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a telegraph   100.1798252857664
at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast   186.20919100974
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society   143.27628965584336
true as day   58.341581561820774
even under this disguise   3.6096748265573098
then quickening their steps they passed the three men but turned back immediately and d artagnan walked straight up to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger said to athos say this to him in english you are a coward   145.86596592945446
to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall   110.63862126135697
all now replied la ramee   120.43720612472674
they merely attached a heavy cannon ball to the feet and then threw them into the sea   159.76360944536742
oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the head   105.55373452736438
you are late my dear porthos   139.27715572062323
albert was charmed with the count s manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge   191.267006610909
i feel my life fast ebbing   68.77168609750385
i might have gone up to him and killed him   138.50395371425475
they are all here said caderousse briskly   145.83626663580264
bonacieux re entered the house passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives went up to d artagnan s door and knocked   153.35004949761063
no replied the young man   100.61184383884893
and i too   109.19313459280264
both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twenty five years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic   107.13238731935209
the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me   163.1742550399705
come now i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise   150.66272345323733
you child why there is not a man who has not believed as you do that his mistress loved him and there lives not a man who has not been deceived by his mistress   54.10478841744015
let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three musketeers behind him   136.49324329300677
i have just left the count sir said he   107.8573891133738
the door of the guardhouse opens as you see   88.97232018640712
enervated prostrate and breathless he became unconscious of outward objects   98.93501349661551
my dear athos cried aramis i think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson god forgive me   146.37347941944165
inquired the king of villefort   118.71481673549162
continued the old man   94.29788118178777
it seems his former master accustomed him to that   205.03040877253488
we set out last evening and here we are   41.62889901837458
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid   107.4590786583668
she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile   60.794114590191484
every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by haydée during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected   142.65149763942642
de tréville looking at the clock   108.73221023857886
and wonderful to see in front of the tower of saint jean was a ship bearing on her stern these words printed in white letters the pharaon morrel son of marseilles   177.51454344488383
the study does not take long   79.33930604602946
but only her   130.50241979868235
they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman   168.61261213047644
i swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion i swear that i no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends   157.36143048870105
the ball fired by porthos s foe went through the throat of his horse which fell groaning   59.35564753700263
she lived in a small town with her brother who was a curate   74.85600937925966
does his action appear like that of an enemy   145.2103309108949
the king waved his hand to tréville who left him and rejoined the musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with d artagnan   161.78681968234653
edmond resigned the lugger to the master s care and went and lay down in his hammock   133.46297523497668
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father   189.28448335370803
after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel those suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart   95.43198341769289
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment   237.32012518507173
d artagnan pursued his way   158.1714989548918
you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old   129.0541080057266
during the night between the 4th and 5th of september madame morrel remained listening for every sound and until three o clock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation   161.88189309976934
i hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit   83.99688319660677
50025m yes replied the count   90.82135138291486
the quarters of monsieur were at dompierre   86.47661139767425
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin   67.62162092714593
the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me monsieur   107.90416958344099
then he will tell it me himself   126.51015635024224
in that case i must say adieu to you as i am compelled to go to naples and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning   72.18857527559518
by its light between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle a quarter of a league distant dantès saw a fishing boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves   104.34433196034007
i give you my word of honor sir said dantès   67.78798961372459
your horses got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strange looking man an arab a negro or a nubian at least a black of some nation or other at a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself   106.75722777860807
said d artagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet come   140.06525209077355
he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire   81.80606320053147
thank you madame i am aware of them now   107.43028709259926
repeated debray   96.27692383506788
broussel had been conducted out of paris without further resistance and was at this time in the prison of saint germain   234.5553648305073
and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison   70.32498836201967
it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond   127.71234982753268
that is replied the jeweller i offered 40 000 francs   136.60176939010807
besides my friend providence has warned us that we may be on our guard   7.768324422290405
then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food   154.60945368375445
laughed the three friends not a bad bargain   144.1712441832256
and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o clock   103.20135192403909
d artagnan mm   68.09987778050123
does the cardinal refuse to receive the king   197.33125586104907
their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threatenings   140.8261519590369
willingly replied de chatillon   156.6339809448845
i shall not have time today   139.19641964247327
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine   151.5809997760108
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin   121.44290852989172
at last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel   78.64624347895437
and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame   110.6179692191894
the investigation would begin at eight o clock that evening in the committee room and if postponement were necessary the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour   118.30689783340088
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all   56.274536962188954
she is a foreigner a stranger   103.36512781107895
i told you this i am now grieved i have kept my word   0.8752822185933411
you have written it   68.69070766305984
well then you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to us   123.09860907565411
this woman must be tried not assassinated   152.6992217474148
the man was an enigma to franz   96.63042544642359
tréville bowed very respectfully with a joy that was not unmixed with fear   126.8323341069761
but i know you my lad said athos appearing on the threshold   93.73083368491554
bring her in said the president   72.80703309686768
d artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver   71.73303778781509
now what is vague is doubtful   93.70819785857083
de boville but not for the survivor   158.27801038637992
as we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity   132.31601693386895
to the swords   205.21436497734436
whence can it arise then   14.202308184251038
possibly my father in law trusted to its general notoriety   151.38263596403286
let us be on our guard   109.48846713300796
we are all mortal my poor friends   157.01287482134978
he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper a mute and touching caress which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the letter   76.6418605693649
they stopped at the sign of the fox in the rue du vieux colombier a tavern known for many years by athos and asked for two bedrooms   9.303698332995182
in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone   179.92348092590976
so much the worse for them said porthos   129.65308805727588
murmured kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself named   97.5763342098407
and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right   123.27297385662675
i am m   91.59095478660309
what i do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil genius   121.13657203974894
as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage   140.9816376885022
the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty five years   65.32887538852785
these protestations were nothing for mme   141.51748926400433
aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you   85.116525009122
teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies   137.14509001662177
the servant announced m   108.13934511666722
that is right cried the marquise   72.06726299470523
your conversation is full of instructive things   60.070836324476254
really said d artagnan these people are very ingenious   122.59189509917162
and madame danglars and m   93.7340701092646
andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room   155.75275999843868
i am doing a little sum in arithmetic   167.4237149997861
well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said d artagnan   145.67812862695092
she is to speak to no one but you if you will do her the honor to address a word to her   87.28175038920449
the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray   202.3357907755537
he ejaculated   159.362649336046
besides said d artagnan pardon me madame if guardsman as i am i remind you of prudence besides i believe we are not here in a very proper place for imparting confidences   155.44439067590645
brail up the spanker   13.382893453834683
well my lord   183.6651627692651
i see you know him exclaimed the wife   140.03691956995075
the invalid s eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable   107.6581339339716
angelo   128.27858558551645
it was his token reserved for the morrow   102.15989472029044
two methods of self destruction were at his disposal   77.09334827185246
i will run for it sir   39.09190062369301
i should like to offer him a last salute   147.01126471022852
that s exactly what my wife said monseigneur   61.599152442624785
if the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem   108.52126478283978
d artagnan has conquered her her that invincible power of evil   78.51378104410324
raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who smiled   148.08581614208683
however replied the abbé with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the rest   72.42718306769605
our safety lies in our obscurity   61.134377906356185
but i don t care   122.37834295429684
she has always been opposed to this marriage and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them   43.41733061940192
said d artagnan looking at her for the first time with much attention   134.27126405249643
allow me then sire to intercede for her with your majesty   102.073698872659
he fell back almost fainting in his chair   81.08959797418754
d artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m   73.70801670512368
god who might have directed the assassin s dagger so as to end your career in a moment has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance   141.83375039807305
the usual guide from the hotel having followed them they had paid two conductors nor is it possible at rome to avoid this abundant supply of guides   107.51582319158658
no d artagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time   60.342515292517774
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half   126.63879578991038
will you have two three five per cent or even more   99.49843846816783
those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o clock to one at cours la reine   106.22706610157974
then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry edmond dantès   138.59365751205885
it may be imagined that d artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest   120.9185732622975
then the two young girls having told him to take it to no   98.43213680985802
that   124.90339462367756
he must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell   163.38768571351358
come come with me gentlemen   140.9362325651317
20061m saved my child   132.2561850760031
they are friends   174.1525499508414
still my three brave fellows   90.84415979703849
the affair is still in projection   119.90832487971034
d artagnan took possession of his command   150.03531810460396
he saw glittering below him the muskets of the guards   112.06019779081426
but when they touched him although under jacopo s directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved   170.83926279216928
yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body   107.92600207646007
did i say dead or alive   80.13756664155656
but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest   50.0550648020415
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell   99.93196958146154
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie   32.94651980307749
do you know with what design m   108.4856980992017
so he opened the door and beckoned the young man in   37.89405951527135
how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them   122.0786304978998
after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco   140.65161451557458
the duke looked furiously at grimaud   80.84773051060537
the king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of monsieur and the queen   67.65378988572411
an opportunity will come replied rochefort   98.45224174227603
it will be time to think about it when we next halt   171.5518458281824
turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips   87.73823552639931
villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called noirtier his father   109.84907074785905
this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu   154.8439375407894
will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation   116.03780487708082
no only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the napkins   89.1281621249509
milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her maid   130.61859461555747
how delighted i am to have found you   107.56209324433253
i was deceived as it appears and i ask your pardon   119.34779330378379
and so edmond s father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone   136.72129189199697
with these four elements paris is ours in a week   113.09578283958434
you must be much fatigued after your voyage   139.87924240847568
besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him   115.28785813872787
he is staying then at the hôtel de londres with you   161.08560419785368
madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees   142.06195162099053
blood   85.8940070919964
d artagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and love   57.51045341046259
at this announcement during which the door remained open everyone became mute and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel   149.71286161689537
i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera   187.93535245626504
several times lord de winter porthos or aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak   95.32400564395988
there said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which i have taken an oath should be buried with me   93.35700200925791
thank you my adored valentine thank you   112.99922505419104
said athos leaning and stretching out his arm to mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him   67.44183125343494
and advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he went   97.21719753485752
the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench   75.33725282481575
there is something in what you have just said said beauchamp laughing   104.26297288632128
therefore i shall go at once and fetch one   56.99199087365213
please to understand that s enough   177.81151332436653
an instant after the man he asked for was before him booted and spurred   128.28721274989962
he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe   118.85374782580332
i did not look on caderousse as a bad man and i thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft   178.6987351431717
he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing beauchamp s arm my friend said he my life is ended   115.04287652203762
and at nine the vessel which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for bayonne raised anchor and steered its course toward england   36.12331315438314
porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words the queen wishes to speak to monsieur d artagnan who must follow the bearer   60.489833706485214
that may be true replied porthos   129.75152032537912
athos took off his hat placed it on the end of his sword and waved it in the air   97.87924811307197
it is done gentlemen said athos   36.757447174789704
but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution   131.37249019518447
and i am curious to know how it will end   184.97024892634073
it is a great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshal s staff to offer you   74.63812885170401
and in what have i been so unfortunate as to displease your majesty   125.73821604681004
replied d artagnan surprised   131.50703522851603
come on here you others he continued rising in his stirrups raising his sword and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught   134.04390767360843
they are always the same   41.185362163322154
besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea   120.40343545977235
but you know athos porthos and aramis and you know if i can dispose of them   182.1411509257794
i come to say that today and for the remainder of the carnival i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal   141.9510650215674
not when it comes from a friend   171.52800367528687
oh miserable creature that i am   121.2499022826317
cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws   44.8073484080583
and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair   111.28616562394502
i could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne   191.3583600292203
do you wish to see the powder room   171.59240023227892
then turning towards albert it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek both of which haydée speaks so fluently   182.93986064452648
the two men in black bowed in their turn   25.305038233419538
and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemnified   120.3277645556069
charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip   113.51850412000536
inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his look   206.79902648606532
what is it you want   119.55462050759408
at this epoch the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did not prevail   166.98242844903297
do you know monsieur de rochefort   121.04362197763945
planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill   103.0892540444356
this point settled the duke turned to d artagnan   74.1351880598927
four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis   141.13935560423792
and are you going to leave me at such a time   147.54702176313194
that s true said dantès   132.25893620520267
i will not suffer it   2.3640176744236214
and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinal s guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you   123.9189111281474
hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself half fainting into a chair   207.17972071901687
yes and for a considerable sum   157.57783933942142
but i am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction   150.54047992564483
madame de villefort raised her arms to heaven and convulsively struck one hand against the other   148.60916779348454
replied the stranger knitting his brow   154.50790895013574
is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the trees   8.441987649898437
most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same tone   117.20202622915201
well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier   111.30558551748469
at a quarter of a league from the city   107.542703518173
no i do not understand   167.10241658721662
i know that is the report   91.85070324191744
i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one   135.0742151848681
the truly guilty said milady is the ravager of england the persecutor of true believers the base ravisher of the honor of so many women he who to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart is about to make england shed so much blood who protects the protestants today and will betray them tomorrow buckingham   61.635661667865065
i will not answer for it said monte cristo   78.94893478654612
others proposed the anguille another kind of recreation in which a handkerchief is filled with sand pebbles and two sous pieces when they have them which the wretches beat like a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer   64.98130171342898
dust i am and to dust i return   163.5481943858171
madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank notes   136.0831312301226
for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there   126.65528439732422
d artagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand   109.00027986491803
yes i know that   80.44626203085164
mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help said d avrigny since she is dead   124.45771538138584
30097m you are right in some degree   137.2628494219462
if you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain   97.7015473326876
halloo there grimaud olivain and blaisois   127.06852422806764
he will not sail   118.5782856178807
i thought we agreed for the price i asked   122.85799654906792
i have another commission for you m   73.76653469510157
but you continued m   40.90206029474194
what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements   83.54546530940586
dessessart ought to be his passport   163.34911436845434
then we will not talk of it until tomorrow   72.97505314699134
can i be deceived   82.69062090227578
my advice is this said monsieur d arminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat   173.57457227015715
morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly   155.5685300015159
the king saved we shall assemble our friends together we will head the puritans reconquer england   130.86007290937619
she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal   149.98047668734355
if they had discovered milady s retreat three were to remain on guard   153.6384163034488
that s true said d artagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in that s true   95.51163418656294
indeed madame said monte cristo i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going   153.02191486085565
what does the animal say   133.90512118820288
i state only what we all know   154.73050397574448
or rather we are very clever said d artagnan   109.35855514880758
commend me to satan   130.89654822892882
father cried maximilian how could you say the pharaon was lost   52.80526812295748
i have no objection to that said aramis from whom the letter and the gold had removed as by magic his ideas of conversion   41.204877644528935
he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet   108.48753501713476
but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the service of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens   73.9004497352642
do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come today to plead for justice   69.07470857294987
some provençal it appears   117.3800046084987
the count had just opened a door   123.1001096967759
they will not touch a hair of your head   169.10123157282084
the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo   118.02246945223636
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description   87.84125904498647
in all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive clientage   129.2157943200656
i have heard here and there that this sister in law was a hussy   107.2285209422058
you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them   157.51339849466393
you will assure us that justice yes yes   117.59915856127871
excuse me sir replied the notary   163.45228289062953
from habit that is all   47.907369423266346
a month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and sorrow   120.01509627291772
screamed d artagnan throwing open the window   177.62761467141567
no said cromwell   71.84243075364638
i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m   119.93759451873714
mordaunt delighted advanced porthos looking at d artagnan with open mouthed astonishment   137.52394496857485
i thought i recognized him and was not mistaken   93.42368085804954
well he did remain with them   108.02662273743556
three months passed and still she wept no news of edmond no news of fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair   175.26654280358414
if we release the prisoner thus we shall never know the truth   67.07915333408546
let the queen remain in perfect security   90.15784019435145
they were going to marry their daughter to m   103.97048636441018
ah i would give much to have five hundred louis only   127.77947316904384
i call those first rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one s hand such as mines lands and funded property in such states as france austria and england provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions   88.05882294470014
yes let us do so   129.366436603767
you can form no idea of the expression of that old man s eye when he looks at me the only person in the world whom he loves and i had almost said by whom he is beloved in return   126.02671214487843
the queen remained silent   62.0003959328351
exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort whilst d artagnan and porthos stepped backward   156.15711255793067
d artagnan hearing the musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of it   146.49510064544637
and the roads were so bad that i brought back all this mud which i have not yet had time to remove   106.0912152534048
ah yes the hashish is beginning its work   169.69209608975137
and in spite of bradshaw s gaze she has not turned pale   72.9955388285368
the other has many years to live   155.8911649298068
instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen   123.20313540377568
would her death affect anyone s interest   127.88945410285882
once more replied the major   159.67263145126384
do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london   215.795195075921
but who said it was buried alive   157.63418183694998
i will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it   54.244203126271785
and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palais cardinal   165.2421267580394
and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room   121.75125115647838
it is our mission to forestall our duties   95.6489259533167
then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart   150.92697132937596
murmured the count   122.40766627582387
but the husband has been punished since and i have obtained full satisfaction   47.25875923687224
the decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by m   158.56833133630326
dantès listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer   108.626499269768
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay and before lens the enemy s entire army   176.5677282292659
mother nanette began by picking up the louis   103.46299959186933
d artagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them   129.5873009276347
i have heard monsieur d artagnan spoken of as a very brave young man said the citizen   135.55390948934388
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden   73.00661579767203
now for my idea   72.30566025999033
no carriage to be had   110.70600696406184
and instead of the lively liquor expected by blaisois and mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder   87.19333903823741
he remembered the count of monte cristo   203.82779304993795
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty   125.13436183397498
and about two o clock he had his two horses saddled and followed by planchet he quitted paris by the barriere de la villete   80.92533023467894
on seeing the prince they hastened to meet him   169.5469258323475
formerly a brewer replied the gascon   54.22076562953864
already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by debray   117.98722985364117
i know not if it is finished my beloved child said monte cristo taking the young girl s hands   168.14692483596448
why bury it there if it were dead   107.45017286948364
in that case you will not get beyond bondy   60.625784756942956
if i should disturb a rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance   130.92131921018537
the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor   118.18307822753958
some further discovery will be made which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close   137.62441472442876
but mio caro did not reply   99.0757048549612
a greenish pallor spread over the count s cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence   80.5918667956332
he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said my worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions   139.19225667616348
he who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there   140.06376361708288
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it   29.928193711819304
de tréville the counsels being thrown into the bargain   90.83726957086805
no but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet   117.85496053183745
in fact the procession arrived in safety at notre dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a te deum   97.769885071274

tis like a duel   90.96482947748359
in the court are orange trees in pots turf and clumps of flowers   202.6819625089089
asked a voice   199.4657593737344
for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it   101.03230310326349
the goldsmith knew the duke   78.0011601678421
they had just finished their double prayer when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell   7.7698865647635955
30191m and are you going there   135.62213181050373
at least d artagnan said to himself as he took the road to villars cotterets at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking   177.75541085371466
that poor count de rochefort   79.99655942540592
i replied the gascon i believe in devotion as a word at one s baptism for instance which naturally comes before one s proper name   178.0257668436683
allies   147.76990625537798
he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came   138.8480155321864
villefort drew back and clasping his hands together exclaimed dead   152.56879515312477
you have friends left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the liberty i hasten to restore to you   110.94924559504872
he had read in the countenances of luigi and teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold which he offered to them   127.43996768959597
and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain   111.59121380811946
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden   59.79196373768123
an infallible one   128.4746341085105
rochefort had returned to the chevalier d humieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll call   119.66898926582428
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known   134.8081582981797
he is a millionaire and they have made him a baron and now he is the baron danglars with a fine residence in the rue du mont blanc with ten horses in his stables six footmen in his antechamber and i know not how many millions in his strongbox   115.11194194491216
you see i can not escape even if i intended   129.57881909683925
villefort caught his arm   115.08940115686225
but what then is the noise   158.8282355157691
but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives himself   90.68545723589821
there is myself replied milady   118.51351873476753
very well sir said the host i ll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain   82.80783044790711
at length i received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him   163.37994336245518
he might go out by one gate and return by another   104.8561984228734
they will no doubt bleed him   28.114470101019606
it is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence   156.4546447451448
the marshal then entered the rue saint honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of saint eustache   136.5101180256055
on the evening before they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the swiss guard germain whither d artagnan had sent for her   128.72360455982138
that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours   159.91808317831612
but you tell me also that the house of thomson french have constantly denied having rendered you this service   112.92766609435388
the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale   69.61740690250699
i shall stay here for a few days longer   92.59310155951785
or kill yourself   61.678937541653475
not before i have killed you poltroon   113.11300602382549
by the governor s orders said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath   88.07320995661918
is this young man an assassin by profession a murderer in cold blood   129.83158294803764
and what else does your worship wish for   208.6006755388328
yes said the major i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye   127.14351776337334
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money   144.56117998235007
he has gone to make his report and to say that all the pigeons are at this moment in the dovecot   102.74401735068896
aramis hesitated   94.1898524217453
i wish to tell him to make my child happy   101.7044027742601
but you promised me whispered the poor mercer   90.3472848837037
proceed was heard on all sides   82.95136028130364
at dessert d artagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease   73.19040618723398
villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied   66.90058860745424
the darkness lasted two hours longer   146.98997621124425
and you approve of what she said that is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts   155.72737691141515
your eminence said comminges as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door   78.61253101258913
d artagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers   39.68619716060303
do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port   68.62355870101693
they bit their lips till the blood came and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might   77.40803208137712
but exclaimed monte cristo why was i absent   139.96270339633782
that is that i have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation   93.36146828064159
noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass   126.77760258017472
aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in haste   69.85669136319238
where do you live   142.42889276681052
he is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse   97.68786073528565
did they speak of me   152.24495971769355
be satisfied my lord i will tell all that i have seen   178.09066860755883
the history to which m   80.44002154885345
athos in his hours of gloom and these hours were frequent was extinguished as to the whole of the luminous portion of him and his brilliant side disappeared as into profound darkness   159.68997014196097
a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded   99.18990962618595
he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be   123.15372593665201
asked madame de chevreuse   98.2204603807985
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based   114.06630465611046
d artagnan knew what she wanted   156.69177330036706
she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses i conducted her   69.00830428882665
at the third knock however steps were heard inside   182.84740649190397
another whom he recognized as the one who had cried out courage   144.4708197347994
it was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and strong   58.91242634651704
send directly to blois raoul   163.92373401445508
a vision at four o clock the four friends were all assembled with athos   102.06073266978991
it would indeed be strange if she checked herself   189.539413818129
perhaps continued villefort he had put it in the foundling hospital   148.2603673039768
the child did not answer   57.32498905294362
yes sir you are right in every particular   134.30162118676617
monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent   67.48020992554538
one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced beauchamp   107.01680380741115
young people are such braggarts   84.62722221029273
oh i am a christian cried dantès guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him   152.5739052346772
immediately on the arrival of m   172.9991545289387
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change   80.28895321333371
instinctively fernand drew back his chair   76.49239329092251
i point one of the poniards at la ramee s breast and i say to him my friend i am sorry for it but if thou stirrest if thou utterest one cry thou art a dead man   130.35958059615936
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d artagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m   129.39871773867046
for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire   79.95383459911329
and i must take care of it for him since i only lend him my name   152.86866624460728
fortunately you have the sapphire   180.31326000451804
and according to his custom d artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him   111.38728240150155
do you wish to speak to us   94.09729752059557
ah porthos   178.05109098669143
he said this madame mazarin is a stumbling block   68.65584995937667
they cried   29.81070803702967
it is an every day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not   87.2286334110123
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment   110.23567871329573
that is the very reason i refused to go back to brussels   117.84363621661645
ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows me   79.5239006790429
the italian s accommodi is untranslatable   172.09880532079822
how will this end   194.27887524659707
when your turn comes i shall have the honor to inform you of it   116.18318028765196
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help   67.97051599735285
i thought so too   160.96172110100645
planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier and d artagnan toward the rue férou   197.7217726113452
noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately   173.66490865065646
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed   127.65761257864371
it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not   161.21126740434164
in the chamber of d artagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged   168.4812044957785
chapter 10   87.08564272468033
the generation who follow us are very precocious   198.75509217735777
and now said d artagnan to the governor s   66.87227448794569
the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white   98.97914531312642
touch me not   140.16187748781255
remain   126.73393356898595
you know they are select affairs   135.9794746208163
i hear she said that paris is not quiet   123.18507427738098
nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her   155.9264377868417
may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars   83.57407345832328
what you know   59.90894742924351
where are your musketeers   94.87627647048188
roman bandits the next morning franz woke first and instantly rang the bell   157.13947284775597
i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable   105.86488340975072
villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases   199.69779935860618
why this evening said the abbess   106.69272650676746
just ask yourself my good fellow whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of   148.34768688529445
edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed mercédès and then again on the gloomy and menacing fernand   82.01564180116648
villefort s father laughed   91.2052598050335
it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you   185.8683568011108
tomorrow my angel   67.83648355879652
but better so than die of shame   128.39561937023808
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince   59.36704242211615
he was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war   103.25707483078307
he listened nothing more   143.43192647097558
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all   141.00819566614297
you do not know my mother   120.53221713893252
the third act had begun   149.63604491974556
• you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg™ works   94.34005025179889
yes but it does not   170.9164782150294
then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you   133.3335040202095
the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion   199.6416230059984
valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting him   83.18486052778866
the countess had this portrait painted during the count s absence   129.2808154976388
d artagnan answered with the greatest simplicity i came to paris with exactly such intentions   51.34237005171502
while the august spouse of your majesty is anne of austria queen of france that is to say one of the greatest princesses in the world   73.69548419408618
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel   101.24616348228028
the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon him   85.31593546718834
you have perhaps no money   64.75070302437136
these are mademoiselle eugénie danglars and mademoiselle louise d armilly   174.51614269925798
how did danglars usually write   115.44270162984992
gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave   148.93741024490262
well then so i will   144.30838290615017
but as we have said d artagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty   99.94250708757401
very true but you introduced me at m   127.8797110161605
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief   75.68377695731077
well now my dear gérard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me   143.08906240110198
interrupted mme   149.06062151861246
as for eugénie she was as strong as a judith or a delilah   174.81831776147288
he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court   224.18077920636634
fourteen years   192.94911457870455
i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell   116.55291936146844
bertuccio bowed and resumed his story   67.64197884605926
d épinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep distress to think of a husband   163.10498329303073
ride fast and give this letter to monsieur de grammont   155.19328686235212
d artagnan now no longer counted the sighs   155.3761713759311
it would frighten you too much   116.67192354017855
added she to comminges   133.79104742630278
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch   23.318049889522754
you say then that the guardsmen sought a quarrel with the musketeers   95.77049622242748
so that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st   125.18513233293365
i can not tell you that replied the inspector   138.5557864127299
don t you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows   54.99497024157818
one moment longer and all would disappear   73.99536086127402
asked danglars in amazement   99.21975167008256
noirtier s eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son   77.93623480124006
the next two days passed in much the same way   88.11309304737391
here is the paper   94.29826803652091
they were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it   125.75167314474477

it is not ill planned said the governor   119.24671861564232
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind   148.91380694205182

30083m the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors and the buzz of conversation   109.46137813071833

gentlemen said d artagnan addressing the guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place   154.13903044882508
alas sir replied the queen i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions   165.7760221069141
mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance   79.43815307744069
porthos abated no doubt of his too great confidence by his adventure of chantilly played with skill and prudence   154.78684784012535
then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this   134.86045844492853

danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker   115.13349397544333
this is the first time i ever heard his name pronounced   70.07721192821086

dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph   113.24006326477387

there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day   98.0307272040566
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given d artagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage   168.37837006494448
20083m and do you propose to make this journey very shortly   79.36738864991437

the real reason madame i can assure you   21.303491139855183
franz remarked while he gave these details that albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it   103.94905298164808
but unfortunately the cardinal was at the louvre with the king   109.40554660899924
and when we have seen the cardinal remember what i tell you athos we shall be reunited to our friends but not in the way you wish   127.0185192165275

a night is soon passed   126.68316721116486

where will he receive me   162.11514691716036
at this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure   165.499352168493
but no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without speaking   222.65071733170677
stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation   138.9192809486185

d artagnan stopped before them and they stopped before him   49.71818615102963
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy   99.72604277994026

my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady   150.77322997087583
so d artagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france   44.55823499834554

he said raising his fine eyes to d artagnan moist with tears the count has left paris without seeing me   171.08473991142324
to kill the turnkey   100.98242004570928
arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband gaspard consider well what you are about to do   163.01486658593495
be calm for i am sure that d artagnan and porthos are at rueil alive and well   119.62425571154722
they are men who do nothing for nothing   59.272716235536905
as to athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating d artagnan by a look   71.42786115179143
the hour came for him to retire   86.29829968661218
nothing she replied with a violent effort   130.3009627911371
well said athos don t you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question   94.86374240882162
well you can ask my servant or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow it was the talk of the house   70.5339377774612
it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were   16.64391086181594
d artagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked for nothing had led him to the examination that the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and horses   97.20574565481864
the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore   71.04743775755101
said the young captain   80.55934975599504
your majesty has given me the control of this business   159.93657509735846
pay me differently   135.50054733850283
are they paid   202.97626268011743
the count of san felice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited   130.0500255489117
monsieur you appear to be in great haste   161.16762655097497
yes they would have all been blown up   80.79917358315541
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme   139.2524546839343
at your service sir he continued   194.81152177116985
milady arose   89.06821552549675
by good luck it had not been extinguished   114.11470128123656
you cry very loud you end by doing nothing   58.83362599513967
he is a quaker then   124.33505529537494
now chevalier he added turning to aramis let us go   140.31316818507784
your host   157.17669920559916
at the foot of the staircase de winter stopped   144.91972620119134
that is different replied monte cristo   77.04235415144035
but i pay that out of my 150 francs that is understood and as i require only eighty francs for my journey you see i am overwhelmed with luxury   183.23266368203488
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed   153.8227672989845
whatever news you bring speak out   209.56128419447816
like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the rue saint honore   108.80766790472961
there was a moment of complete silence during which dantès still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time   72.4064591196063
for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the king s attorney   48.90133135588083
and is the reason known   86.17331101391632
i really did not remember   59.293895932080765
that is impossible   47.78145515069025
i know not why but i feel that this crime you acknowledge then the existence of the crime   147.6930280898451
he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany   193.03707436891824
danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goat skin and did not breathe another word   87.27438656665234
he therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at mazingarbe   71.69733267483261
said madame de villefort selecting a new point of attack   95.40002624730386
yours   131.02527017865097
he found planchet all ready   161.48890988703087
besides remember that alexander was lame and hannibal had but one eye   108.58658858385554
and where was that   191.23922083856615
he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to forty five years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and well shaped mustache   122.08571429897927
i swear it   97.18355304952405
on the contrary sir i have ten   164.8021219395897
the englishman delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition pressed d artagnan in his arms and paid a thousand compliments to the three musketeers and as porthos s adversary was already installed in the carriage and as aramis s had taken to his heels they had nothing to think about but the dead   46.96402372771327
we intend to visit the abbé scarron for whom i have a letter of introduction and at whose house i expect to meet some of my friends   181.10520929801487
take the best horse you can find   181.08100482110382
the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor   192.39820508541797
oh not a word said she in a concentrated voice not a word of all that i have said to you to this man or i am lost and it would be you you then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying with a gesture of infinite terror her beautiful hand to felton s mouth   148.43653826622443
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger   196.08144452288715
the four friends exchanged a joyful glance   103.19761678840545
and your first is still living   122.70273652766981
a great service what was that   5.852293387980993
adieu then edmond   112.14998457653354
i yield to your protestations i yield to your assurances   184.7747044142203
we dined so very late hastily interposed la carconte   169.98135960969108
i narrowly escaped catching a fever there   49.065735780152565
at this moment planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont   175.66644877303708
you belong to the court doubtless yet i have never seen you at court   116.76719812570931
i fear i am committing a great imprudence   173.28972034538265
intrigues terrify me   145.02481186553425
then wait said aramis   99.58644550528689
she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repeated it maximilian   52.36595795533124
and yet if we burn it who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes   100.50022536792217
farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of st   69.48846341844362
my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur d artagnan is confined that is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery   88.85332028613605
while the rest slept then we went away a short distance   118.87848415060887
noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile   110.5042354393945
and yet you spoke of him at once   98.38554774108894
every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile instead of vincennes   47.095098695360775
besides it will not be for long   38.631573637458416
asked the fruiteress on the opposite side   140.07944283846325
during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay   120.89651086986171
i thought i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle ages   170.86428413714378
you are a fool m   213.44442874091027
no for i will not allow you to do so   157.3350596762631
i have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire   157.48108303129712
and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer   92.14308330262276
he dismounted and knocked on the door   45.5464679633088
he and the count de guiche are like each other s shadows   78.08610024244948
a proof   142.65179858735107
we shall be murdered there said aramis   137.2549584002255
i will do so   78.60961780002367
sell this ring a ring which comes from my sovereign   106.5257201596889
it is well said the abbé   61.15078086557825
this gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with anger   158.3402830862627
i think i know what you want replied athos   90.24281266775075
the right idea has just occurred to me   44.54910919148449
their number was great   186.7792928829345
meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of rocroy fribourg and nordlingen   68.67840428345448
then he added so my friend it s your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape   172.96698862831505
dresses in fine style   72.83477467648578
a man of talent and merit whom you will like as i and monsieur de chavigny do i am sure   183.22389441686698
cried one of the guards will you persist in saying most discreet aramis that you are not on good terms with madame de bois tracy when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs   103.56473722019132
listen said m   124.39891823428334
my faith my good host said d artagnan filling the two glasses i asked for a bottle of your best wine and if you have deceived me you will be punished in what you have sinned   187.85200176063515
listen said monte cristo   115.27236406414481
and he awaited with impatience the moment always in the future when aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock   174.171349987059
d artagnan i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you   136.71427488194598
and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true   118.68423282786642
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i and eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti   42.22946297572281
that s unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as yours   120.44765814127943
felton cried she you are as great as judas maccabeus   122.28753776725218
each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to porthos and mousqueton   103.95311062180956
the people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate   56.78592149204962
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m   173.9424369695943
ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion   40.526802483464095
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and château renaud   114.85412129221503
i have given the signal   142.09853546530593
danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase   89.402606213475
germain or in the pré aux clercs   135.54568430361755
did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood   198.94408209376974
are we softened a little   140.66189524266537
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to d artagnan and a well known voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak   60.596153409720856
the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water   98.74085703552839
an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel   73.01538982954442
when they had advanced about twenty yards danglars looked back and saw fernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon   112.65091259116777
her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals   142.034243431674
ten minutes elapsed during which d artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second   70.08955408109954
that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the tyne against us   116.13875100589846
father and daughter we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugénie danglars and m   152.21607155229805
the monks had no longer an instant of repose   40.273966299325934
signed el kobbir   145.2203833347259
you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid   69.5277912090178
fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference   149.64379339756496
my friend said morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future   142.42457644935052
vade retro satanas   73.18075028643693
but by careful search it might be recovered   128.64569941706247
i attempted to cry out   143.72157742128553
scarcely was the captain s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the island of elba instead of making for marseilles direct   148.13608835323902
faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed   181.37241716368314
dessessart pointing to d artagnan   42.225667384725426
albert rose   82.49637774403831
cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more i shall have fourteen   116.7385059399687
they will not be strangers they will be friends   174.18464558425916
and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter   157.82119681032543
ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used   89.23211847214849
he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold and one which i have in my pocket   186.20345525336592
and withdrawing the knife from the wound in rita s bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest   118.06704289487178
on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed   86.38153244869808
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal   91.12931577933864
arrested   119.74060483321333
ried in a place he knows   88.17044033537825
what a noise behind us   129.65093800879845
he owes money to the office and is backward in his pay   85.37586772995425
that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not   84.115642979103
i forgot you and m   101.76191959359136
morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster   132.902280586833
haydée s learned reference is to the behavior of an actor in the dionysian festivals   133.8837801736454
my dear d artagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary   57.3147214436886
i will show you the way and he went in first   102.82091844996113
he cried this time we shall be pursued   137.15427355673566
we must not do so   26.17849478395152
he had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry   155.38749921401498
and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you i hope that i remain your friend as well as that of what the devil are their names d artagnan and porthos   173.20686109124128
it is a quarter of an hour s journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hour s journey from the city to hither   102.99123646285759
thank you madame said mazarin   155.91220094336103
from what you relate i suppose it to have been the evening of madame de saint méran s death   160.6370544684021
if the letter must be written under your censure my faith i renounce the task   47.15736050846357
well monsieur la ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at once   136.02692914256852
ough   61.74381488515054
to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom   121.47174374730986
but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene can not fail of being a most ridiculous one   157.9822075048646
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette   166.60100629750812
as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains   1.6663565526887396
hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone   67.97696127916689
nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement something in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject   144.21651770251674
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me   125.43973908191947
de tréville s recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me afraid   194.21851734390498
he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him   94.96264098985758
they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false besides why should he tell a falsehood   101.72890315619057
de salvieux   104.4434734583916
and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow   142.24327975737418
that mood lasted some time   113.5175273861922
but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting   161.20276541315087
come porthos   126.10468107876895
beauchamp   109.3097738814205
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i don t stand upon ceremony said d artagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep   162.6350649489418
then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did   125.42464245456475
didn t i say that your police were good for nothing   68.95373732876551
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea   83.95469328349591
if you see him coming on one side of the street pass by on the other   126.84676972901258
i however do not understand said porthos   116.60867035548613
the event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas   83.20053412047838
in the first place do you accept   75.28130825586736
chapter 99   107.11317466597208
yesterday he wrote again   130.99464082532535
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter   159.06917829525963
the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud   96.40445641859375
i can not tell you my name since i do not know it   178.30566445045875
you are right said the duke   88.73882307229708
not exactly replied the mendicant   129.3973293611394
you will find mousqueton there   115.68198980229745
i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers   97.4366976221534
it was still about a quarter full as we before stated   1.2786665826299384
i will show you the way back myself said the captain   142.83942232304307
monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories   164.2611904112091
to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of d artagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d artagnan   81.9093123191189
well then at the end of a month when drinking water from the same carafe you would kill the person who drank with you without your perceiving otherwise than from slight inconvenience that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water   82.52334290157563
approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known   61.457541627983616
we do conspire as your eminence might have seen the other morning   127.78561132629204
he spoke the romaic language did he   164.89950286934155
so you hate each other   91.59200863589979
meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men   92.55677836273566
on the contrary let us speak about it   107.19672987749615
the musketeer met with a superb andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire legs clean and elegant rising six years   129.67637127286787
compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive   128.69950493223988
i congratulate him upon it   139.2583409948244
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face   130.88050292979187
living my best friends would avoid my house   139.35353416968496
take my arm and let us go   100.32715158941207
he saw franz and m   174.66749318404254
one takes no note of time   130.51224780767922
he extended his hand and rang the bell thrice   105.10549816093167
and besides the crime appearing useless it would be folly to commit it   218.49742192190865
you are i am edmond dantès   100.76357517747026
at that moment porthos entered   129.60941917964172
seek then my lord seek these gentlemen   97.14992447250991
lord winter s tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two   200.6913465825039
you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot long   147.340677295229
besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else   141.07740270498496
someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned around   61.52216154303758
doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window   50.28445376785464
do you know the numbers   141.90841540082016
then bending his face down to athos s ear what is the object of this visit   84.830669310769
that evening continued bertuccio i could have killed the procureur but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken   112.50543849438503
she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after   96.95650068402072
50227m what have you to offer to me my friend   131.18985133412204
you know how difficult it is to discover the truth   56.66561551952953
but time fails me   114.74266696051791
for as i am a good catholic i firmly believe i am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman   51.90533327461113
while speaking caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions   144.6492635610368
but i only came back on one condition that i would transmit to your majesty the will of the people   111.32440315134552
believe me madame as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosom a heart devoted to you believe that you have been the idol of our lives   107.99262189343045
as long as it was dark they remained silent   137.72708457412676
de wardes that provoked her thus   130.92657787559136
yes said porthos let us take the opposite direction   26.1304489366795
he had not even a knitting needle   119.89849179458135
with regard to d artagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet   94.95807076886555
come said d artagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery   154.0355310747662
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie   166.29511753472258
said mousqueton   134.77406868541078
she saw albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused   158.26820981511304
and kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said haydée in a tone of chastened anger   133.0059486418215
and bernouin do i not take him with me   97.51908509211002
and he added with a smile he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance   95.01423761937895
it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50 000 francs of m   115.78911701159382
and remember my life depends on your answer   95.24550351402503
so you see my lord since i am hungry i would with your highness s leave and la ramee bent low   91.10039175358686
d artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed good he said   57.30321106238782
d artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him   96.60309595500509
he cried in a tone which electrified the coachman   177.51701549988172
at the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon athos   33.278408078191944
let us go in said monte cristo   170.23131550591557
you forgive me then sir said raoul and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young indian   100.65282601230741
fortunately as we have said they were within a hundred paces of the city   104.24194634222188
and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant   74.30466784492201
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing   224.54238161767944
that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink   83.28241629478111
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information   90.13924074022435
i ought to have known you better by this time   51.527222805033176
to the boats my lads as quick as you can   203.4885763137545
albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for bertuccio but he was gone   117.23124126173921
yes i wish to speak to him   141.81153086858546
they all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially mademoiselle valentine so good so kind and so gentle   207.01270959744627
come said danglars will you take a million   93.58024098622215
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river   116.52881717600559
news from your father do you hear henrietta   138.68864089978436
but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please   182.57149972323927
he was a medical man i think   118.49748753963314
i married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family   133.4663698791598
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming   138.11791731051952
i indeed invited them here today on your account   122.9728480737406
we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably i may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship   103.33363646158588
and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of your eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that i may not commit an error   131.2212427224081
long live the emperor   107.93784301038401
i will think of maximilian   93.11866272839804
in his arms he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to life   36.373869040712876
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation   62.12748424049188
that was a superb throw so i left off there   182.25388329064933
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not   75.03365511548046
a probable thing   174.00446036972494
he had but one thought to go forward   81.90884644408999
i do this oh my god said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine   145.45879401411057
this letter as he spoke maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry   132.25154504701388
we must therefore watch and play a close game   106.28224981013354
but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope   204.52847952286103
and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed   72.75865030227723
i shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that   82.2029587656495
so i will not abandon this bouquet   112.16949374165641
my friend my father said morrel with excitement have a care i again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me   167.8846748559653
you will know presently my friend   0.9989899559390807
the prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape   210.05555878138333
he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed   81.99703055767503
if you repent there is still time   113.65835409509936
i doubt it planchet replied d artagnan but what are you thinking of   126.22781821714378
he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the louvre   103.90884049956523
the nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full security   139.2026703965447
come continued athos executioner do your duty   150.88411838657598
for the first three days i heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth i heard nothing   70.8660234793175
i am all attention said d artagnan   136.7086660338508
were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer   143.32392030966088
d artagnan looked at the two women one after the other and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion dame nature had made a mistake in their formation   83.5713885500421
did you fancy yourself dying   76.58522896126615
from england   29.104686798316038
i saw my father s hand tremble   141.495561424274
i am not difficult of access sir   140.98470881577026
and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent humor   138.31429514335738
but why don t you come there also   109.76559848130812
give way   74.2629219267881
well well said m   98.56162481287667
but i conjure you do not abandon me   90.75430268500757
at least that of the minister   78.34181424812527
he went down to the stables picked out a pie bald andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse   97.35670162497298
one night however i heard his sobs and i could not resist my desire to go up to him but when i reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying   133.37115358245762
at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following   153.17609290831214
he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in france or england of multiplying his millions but remember that though i place great confidence in busoni i am not responsible for this   207.44628436210027
because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing   103.30854760873012
cried the young girl extending her hand through the opening and seizing maximilian by his coat for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lover s calmness could not be real   42.020468599428156
the accusation m   116.70246046408177
say no more i entreat you   128.27404103982008
his father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his forehead   79.16956576980981
and what was it   145.53995812804746
how can we be implicated in any way   194.62052563124075
chapter 46   25.4834582894554
but you sent for me my dear child   210.0922036763012
for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble voice   116.85963162326179
by degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his course   115.69293074125933
you may madame said he with emphasis   89.23083209697535
he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols   96.75831746836324
that may happen one day   225.57920405003347
have you decided   192.68542429664168
but can you find your man   64.81763745755156
all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance   120.05127385483561
that s all that is necessary said athos   104.86517674988352
but i have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations   117.70572322296084
who has displeased you   114.14459469476249
i see nothing in that very extraordinary   68.71620820249281
no i will go and speak to him myself   95.70431921209429
valentine shuddered   137.37686967243454
when one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence   124.23010779355961
will it be the same this evening   62.41573953627034
in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone   124.36027384420618
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin   187.40935794175937
let me see continued the stranger i am one of your largest creditors   86.71005239122947
because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman s voice   91.39938804288465
stir but a step said they and you are a dead man   70.78394889983045
what does she say   127.02779765044463
about that   200.7931182079407
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength   154.76134073395906
shall i see you again before your departure   84.25885952061145
danglars looked absolutely stupefied   138.92063959954098
murmured m   33.10651161638333
some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed   93.61956366771486
alone in the world i had but my son and he has left me   158.86305496156177
de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and d artagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning   142.97830523097252
he must be indeed a strange man   102.27147677577908
you go to madame d aguillon s and you pay your court to her   11.647941748629634
but you are wounded it seems said planchet   111.85270094110605
not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber above as he supposed the bedroom of athos   66.55653613588396
but let us see   12.719430119254255
why should that man give me a false diamond   140.4899378037752
his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage   116.20467108057096
felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door   102.25653820904698
monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation   163.01635538690377
on saturday if you will yes   83.15652011586496
then said the young man with anxiety i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position   122.18783515092072
the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dantès   144.77490428621763
for three months i watched m   142.72848530385943
the coal black hair large bright glittering eyes in which a wild unearthly fire seems burning the same ghastly paleness   118.30419328684779
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear   166.54835575683046
sire it was impossible to learn   92.98072202092551
oh blind self love   151.59420475388393
said emmanuel thinking of morcerf and danglars   128.79578405693914
estafania give up the keys of my drawers and my desks   75.68728912974416
and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare   141.57046838482057
their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools   92.68294137654688
d artagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a mazarinist   160.85315415001625
ah said he we have at pisa ugolino s tower   119.05962580847768
and that is what is amusing you at this moment   113.85362161041034
how long did the queen remain out of the chamber   92.48721438251647
i heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty   122.23393228715776
the cavalier addressed some words in english to his sister   168.82594453642662
why from the french government   33.27004795040976
an instant after porthos and aramis re entered the surgeon and m   145.4309530666693
you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today   52.61685728070361
d artagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side   9.767148088740669
these men are the ones who saved her   147.13777241445788
that manoeuvre has saved my life several times   150.63854309257
but her majesty has no property interposed aramis   91.48116394965086
take the hundred pistoles   91.2776930468842
and what effect does he produce   112.75970893449662
and you see you would have been deceived   80.63765040847855
you have a recipe for it   117.63316234386845
and i keep my word   55.124700698710484
you come at a fitting moment   143.25469005765405
when the emperor returned from the island of elba my brother instantly joined the army was slightly wounded at waterloo and retired with the army beyond the loire   242.38967464747031
ah good heaven   137.5605615703806
the soldiers seized dantès who followed passively   89.84227228702949
an old man who was digging busily at one of the beds stuck his spade in the earth and approached cap in hand striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek   99.70072611089736
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude   126.65556102031971
one of the forty methods of escape of the duc de beaufort   166.12611057658543
will you examine them   79.78164852711046
no but it may be sent in something else   182.28232134172472
valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart   111.25516085356607
sit down at the table and let us drink   60.859938347983835
i will then   172.462645725549
pierre obeyed   114.3319085104489
i beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish too italian or too arabian   158.22968412892908
it was a signal   96.55849960248477
his room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody   74.02336585741634
bazin my friend said aramis i believe you meddle with my conversation   94.02516392523336
and you abuse my love   137.4163042989034
i shall buy a chestnut colored suit   94.07815681192642
at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken   99.40848969344006
has it ever happened to you   64.4912821892009
the half pistole is for me   100.38778781061475
raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed   90.08149837623134
i gave the custom house officers a copy of our bill of lading   175.20630277797972
500 000   20.965408756950865
see said d avrigny to villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow   127.12057814560305
everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting   124.84255691338483
sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty   178.0803341656075
and you monsieur aramis   201.087174662086
exclaimed the countess   182.04056118302893
danglars sighed while he carved the fowl   75.6022093557543
both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battle field   104.76709398852601
but still he is charged with what   143.09528836163378
the young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour them   119.73628255838564
and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to   216.8316211615463
richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than i am   98.83034217933434
help help help   118.18261161302338
i am going said albert as he made his parting bow   66.25341721791015
there has been fighting then   152.57314780537573
the other was a convent of jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers   80.98742378672553
you have called haydée your sister let her become so indeed valentine   127.17510932116834
oh pray name it   153.97410908479458
i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater   102.46991504804575
we have a rendezvous you remember at the place royale   78.51978613301347
i paused but i had already drunk half a glass   189.88342733038786
i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely   137.00667417896204
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already two thirds gone   151.85388082792488
if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required athos would no more give him his hand athos would renounce him   169.7921999481287
from dieppe   95.36277545228373
at times he thought of those brave french gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in dreams   94.53302564581134
he took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide   123.08504807389042
then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing   129.96288112999216
take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours   112.25723029993082
follow us planchet   99.99383300795881
aramis does the same to porthos   70.4351070274188
he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence   160.85267853873984
milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again   95.31359909249905
let my lord at two o clock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts   119.69373977172738
what is that line   167.29248662071973
the cemetery of père lachaise chapter 106   190.56778072324335
well what   125.73939759524879
this time it was the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience   149.63065588195062
the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly   137.4972150155707
but i forgot added the gascon smiling pardon i forgot you are no longer athos   159.04238623634015
i have no doubt of it   136.25315503490384
the affair was not long i assure you   124.42025904690631
and grimaud threw the dagger on the table   153.50651165683053
come he was the first of us to go   111.68889446493058
only this cellar has a ventilating hole   76.32371619536059
but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask   65.87124447930728
nevertheless you come as one in authority   130.14586227116195
why when i found myself utterly destitute i thought my old friends would perhaps assist me   181.61889382959407
philosophy m   81.50833587153457
here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner   167.96651374641624
cried porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens   106.90944117215857
you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars in order that i may execute edmond s last wishes   180.5034069888734
i am he   79.2610872633573
does this oath satisfy you   143.35039638556248
his eye rested longer on the president and still more so on the king s attorney   65.07118870916915
believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own   138.95507849757848
while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night   111.82625034879825
it is the former executioner of bethune   11.762080024345536
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message   181.55686398301825
but i have since learned that you had that right   148.6009161215867
pray don t heed him sir   134.72965473225042
edward endured the accident with miraculous courage he did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms   131.59310215994478
then in the midst of the songs of his sailors songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down he saw the island of monte cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert   99.86015976321828
well that she may have no doubt on that head i will go and inform her myself   121.67792377376259
but what do i see in the water something struggling   15.439979311190683
au revoir then   80.8544202598568
how strange that it should not have occurred to me before   155.54355294281532
monsieur and dear friend ah yes   74.28473816418816
i have one but not one from cardinal mazarin   160.90576388995098
de villefort has so many important and urgent occupations   29.493419234655605
meanwhile the heat became excessive   138.14672844202352
he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme   98.89933267308686
ah i can understand that   115.42316223175581
in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road   45.010421776227474
sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know   138.81924628188182
75 in the rue de la harpe   116.3968898648291
to love you cry fie   109.48797933722929
i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutter yes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together   140.05821845420257
now i don t set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at tyburn or sent for change of scene to the indies   73.42088227005782
and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206   147.03359559322996
this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through   248.8751316484564
our friends   151.71371400865456
madame de vernet was driven from me putange was exiled madame de chevreuse fell into disgrace and when you wished to come back as ambassador to france the king himself remember my lord the king himself opposed it   113.08957360057742
i am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it   124.19148146904055
d artagnan resolved to try and enter the louvre   97.5247903769336
but as he could serve us in other ways i wished to inform him   110.70407024966475
that milady s son has left england that he is in france on his road to paris if he be not here already   185.85511785034544
and as the invitation was for september 1646 i couldn t accept it   140.95085381585602
stuart begged this favor and harrison consented   109.03585269345898
but what changes occur   147.7991675553057
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him   85.51193507445751
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital   169.68289192517975
but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that dandré was irrevocably lost   155.30140034458793
considering the gravity of the occasion i permit you to speak my friend   128.87968963227175
my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions   53.445755060268354
then she broke the silence to cry out you are cowards miserable assassins ten men combined to murder one woman   85.13443264322777
my wife s brother is my brother said edmond   61.19079198714968
said porthos it would be a pity   53.37293023683328
the fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil dantès paused with anguish on his brow   128.85509836903526
or have you forgotten them   110.51072715725317
well then a good journey to you said caderousse   123.41051320385941
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him   140.31838193413878
asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him   88.41490654230498
oh he said he is mad   139.16045046654875
it had not been used   163.2221863234673
but i have already met m   183.8813993705292
mademoiselle replied morrel with a bitter smile i am selfish you have already said so and as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself   198.49940736759203
you receive 1 500 francs per annum for your services here more than many a brave subaltern who continually risks his life for his country obtains   207.06939770411486
i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house   99.65891889727327
we separated as you know   149.0660748417494
that i may be sure i have the right man   77.44432178565707
but felton did not give him time to draw it   183.0003404066831
said d artagnan to athos your king has thoroughly taken me and i am quite at his service   246.54926828693445
they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day   104.51838670266001
valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother   140.0492427545747
the first to return will recover his chamber   195.89900495045418
several persons are invited and among others m   137.9399255751605
ah my dear friend   105.98789206293836
we shall see each other again after the campaign   98.50916938935964
afterward we shall see   108.92009212817828
ah my dear sir you are most welcome   48.303627569189985
in the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush   180.5206084174226
but i assure you mother i have a strong intention of defending my person and i never felt half so strong an inclination to live as i do now   191.5916928589237
i was within two paces of you monsieur replied the procurator s wife   94.08481221848672
no sooner said than done   132.7174368997561
suppose there were a window in this wall   79.55570964595493
but i serve the one with joy and the other against my will   176.41532684485887
since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red   177.1594294077857
then you shall not leave this place said he   130.9485140406961
it will refresh you   81.74261521732372
cried aramis that accounts for the cry i heard   101.94293488237582
make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your business   119.7104558467459
today even   145.90260199087197
write my lord he said   137.09543508964586
why they are our men   100.39584743215246
on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected   132.49060843923394
now sir said monte cristo addressing andrea make your confession   101.34158620350189
bertuccio said he i intend going this evening to normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day   133.11310943558732
you are a christian   100.97901226839224
and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody   93.1531197279314
quite attractive by jupiter   64.15543812161953
dantès obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following 0245m this 25th day of april 1498 be   92.93898667284618
the captain gave him a loaded carbine   143.12672625101993
i had been tracked by a customs officer who had lost sight of me near the tavern   66.857661880679
then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening   95.44459785073639
he asked in a low voice   155.36927514929909
shall two members of the house be sent to yanina   107.39813494868764
but his place was well filled by the duc d elbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff   147.33391092563048
morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially   90.42547994621253
this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow   122.2300079074318
i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned   137.91716101549596
from being suspected they have become suspicious   30.24175737994591
when shall i strike   96.94937009549393
mercédès said caderousse eagerly   109.04094605421332
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune   47.59001221844281
whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back   121.44095590682844
you must have a ladder   166.48658079622962
that s correct said the captain   119.12418932722204
but come i am waiting for you   48.56955239353469
but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers   174.818848645446
he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens with his laurel in his hand friquet reached councillor broussel s threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag   99.63146813352137
said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i can t keep on my legs   130.23267050189023
day came the jailer entered   124.9123987838986
then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be let   53.3074334557428
morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your knees on your knees he is our benefactor the saviour of our father   90.78347652053598
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services   36.257617368201
monte cristo glanced at bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling   66.21933520631421
you are charged with having surprised state secrets   207.78591627396582
the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards chapter vi   139.04013923508683
with your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that i dreamed that i was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so   131.32477876565983
my lord continued felton becoming more excited as he spoke my lord beware   134.4286941575887
confound it interrupted porthos with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room   48.08850470383038
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companion s half reproachful observation on the subject   157.72590213651662
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu   100.44561619338468
but what is the matter with my hands   146.94279021597194
the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted   40.78022532767119
franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible   101.0586953495654
this chamber was a sort of garret situated in the rue des fossoyeurs near the luxembourg   99.22731876909549
i will take him dead that s all   168.85314398415983
he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions   116.75711863378669
exclaimed an old puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant   83.80072323546979
i know these lovers   160.14866588061352
the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly   115.96622427300464
from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees   37.56395252690575
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist   137.57882350389588
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said   179.32872277628832
it s my spanish wine that has got into your head is it not   141.25066108369722
asked the priest anxiously and eagerly   128.57211641976312
come he said you have me in a snare gentlemen   131.30355756862122
just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis   92.91326141359934
i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly   127.03236174619965
it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and them   157.1945002865536
then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die   152.1907895493144
it is all one to me now said d artagnan   67.41189659301222
why if my information prove correct a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered   74.75235157254171
in the hands of the devil you mean   37.07129849079914
cried one of the guests   122.60213545607002
her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess   135.27769370605867
day gilded the tops of the houses   151.50708710940035
soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan   158.62446240817974
it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind   133.07616402098614
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed   9.008863207630142
he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw   139.5772121194859
do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your mother in law in the presence of m   94.45892279433644
i regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each other   72.84483054348856
my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father who was glancing anxiously around   106.22139166323178
villefort shuddered at the suggestion   120.12873600685298
that you will fire first   37.05637035307487
are you not his confessor   172.486323348673
you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount albert de morcerf   64.46580602441212
yes he s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow   161.96310132686676
the sport was bad   170.08969306054777
nor i said aramis   155.37672333244745
and from that date up to the present day a hundred times perhaps   125.54720697420288
we can talk of it afterward   81.49420125944884
said d artagnan you are insupportable   17.364373592764608
there he is attending mass in the chapel of the virgin   90.35539782950913
laporte could not leave the louvre   2.6907232971123562
monsieur mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please   76.55072692049613
there is no providence all comes by chance   97.34247708558995
besides the wheels of a carriage which appeared to have come from paris had made a deep impression in the soft earth which did not extend beyond the pavilion but turned again toward paris   66.21259415954229
resumed the procurator s wife with a sigh   84.56831254930644
yes look at yourself in that glass   94.86166222975373
hello grimaud   25.89813992063918
very good said d artagnan   107.75445150740896
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemen s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him   123.31246813523445
they are indiscreet   167.4893255383152
valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven   96.21071691246578
they rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and dust   182.00488525676826
he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny   58.02848041011661
so much the better said athos   147.52500430939537
he is a bully and so am i   84.45609910209659
cried d artagnan i see black points and red points moving yonder   91.50967400087168
he was an irishman one of the most skillful of his craft and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the duke of buckingham   153.40979744075588
faith you are indeed right not to return to it   183.1262455008959
anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one   144.8289742890423
yes my dear boy replied the old man it is very fortunate   58.37277979200696
they all cried out straw   180.02046669068108
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly   72.53332970955881
he knocked and the door was opened   113.41027591597734
then you suffer a great deal   100.97981239567561
franz perceived how completely he was in his element   132.41552192895506
the door opened and a dim light reached dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him   87.24613938945993
with whom is he then   78.56023832428073
valentine valentine   75.60588573591761
for i swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years ago you athos in the rue ferou and you aramis in the rue de vaugirard   169.82676036577914
but i repeat i am made up of contradictions   201.67725141201333
replied morrel   134.4405012723725
i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning   132.51427190572588
you want me to throw again do you not   121.72860051005304
he remembered that morcerf had been taxed at 4 000 crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than morcerf he fixed his own price at 8 000 crowns   97.33439755974726
and this elixir where is it   117.27032081932387
from my childhood i have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over me   137.3100645171776
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks   124.26188495067736
i go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms   101.83264277952158
yes indeed but one   153.09952431685957
andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie started up like a jack in the box   168.2763301908995
her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress   119.80551504900475
fly   192.11831025501124
tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke   124.86513698229814
although this man was scarcely thirty six or thirty seven years of age hair mustaches and royal all began to be gray   138.09007337096742
he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence   142.9838458223742
you have succeeded   123.57955740029642
still if people will shut themselves up said albert and can not be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen   125.43731267255482
oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it   202.9719236106787
two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man   60.56441095680085
de tréville a request which the other with an air of protection promised to transmit in due season   115.46225011222684
you have done this i hope so at least   136.1999655652735
my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper   168.587348302138
all this is perhaps folly perhaps insanity   85.37059516863201
he was told my lord will pardon me certainly speak   118.15622885208701
he turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner   71.66192806023915
dantès said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way   107.15711572594107
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded   137.7108636534246
i have seen russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab   133.7046108732217
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber   179.00131003556723
and you go in an hour time to eat a morsel during which i shall send for a post horse   58.97682662580702
all this was answered by an expression of d artagnan s   179.53232866490112
whom does this belong to   99.50164146056845
i bring him to you madame said athos withdrawing his hand hoping that in your turn you will do something for him   165.59143898125416
it would be better to take her to her carriage   171.30793482122579
oh mercy m   151.54475252072842
asked the editor of the ministerial paper   165.80870101705358
but if you have entertained any doubt as naturally you may i feel that i am ruining myself by speaking the truth   136.87147989016103
i am rancorous the only stigma that proves me to be a churchman   180.3266395017493
worthy fellows   143.55663985381986
athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man refused   67.75067024104112
dear friend i shall sacrifice myself and go and see anne of austria   122.40724738010228
on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger   121.7305006783277
nevertheless she remained motionless   137.65891743478414
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franz s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet well pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum   149.78607203368242
morrel was only thirty one barrois was sixty years of age   81.56530138068298
demanded the musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to d artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures   79.56328865227967
since my misfortunes i have been subject to faintnesses which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver   135.91209332533353
mazarin sent us to cromwell   93.91654674656724
go then into charenton for i shall begin in a short time there s a signal from the prince   126.63158187798574
when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade   85.62334736743642
the king has spoiled him of his name and property   106.01624295789358
he will do everything wrong   100.19491042530208
you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation   138.70203444289717
finally he slept   112.77794204624685
i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife   162.3176399474178
that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers   100.8550171760645
i have looked around me said mordaunt and i have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain   116.56817228359964
why you see edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the young   68.70617609411157
as to porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair   88.0863038550956
and you say you will wait for me at armentières   109.08600650934076
did the people shout at all   84.82374912786692
knock said the count and announce me   153.63924730910784
tried on before the glass a narrow brimmed hat of his son s which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it he took up a small bamboo switch cut the air with it once or twice and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics   112.94345783090263
i took the mule and the horse for what he owed us   130.44792281524346
coquenard s chamber   28.987500537977
noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude   118.6468256413551
good the luxembourg   136.32903191821913
the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him   169.89588735703995
emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols   81.37313821807643
i love him devotedly   158.13344721832812
an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him   92.46322114947998
the following morning with the banker s usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man s hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for caderousse   121.81255314325742
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman   105.84671536463732
it was danglars   34.18822311504678
the prince assigned to every one his post   114.80663245849836
that s strange   129.181561050835
does she wish that   177.83950916148206
is mine   205.97110364546836
let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives   162.35063477652722
finally athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving england in case either of failure or of success   90.40713373544732
the baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out   126.4822049556966
i can not allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render   115.61410432370286
did you witness the injury sustained by comminges   113.86614139981675
next moment d artagnan entered   122.70964051590191
madame de villefort   66.12279975949019
oh as to that i shall take care i assure you   174.05217557101383
i waited for him until this hour replied franz   54.76631107935781
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water it was the general s body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead   150.90818126406072
can it be with me   196.3322919516845
asked julie   224.18400236676786
exactly opposite the other   64.12581320452797
you look at me and you are going to laugh at me   37.20953572562186
the sudden departure of franz after being summoned by m   198.0111446011885
soubrette and mistress chapter xxxiv   112.69015001017178
bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed   80.15143823761376
i understand why you accepted it and i grant you my pardon   64.49244113424083
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion   73.21934012952114
argumentum omni denudatum ornamento   132.65382552486707
the sitting commences at two   111.92546183739137
shall i tell you each ornament of your toilet   61.62411385113503
i have my sword   65.76602742474554
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am   20.517027673410908
replied d artagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general   95.85717434277262
in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal s guards who recognized d artagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning   115.70227443405359
noirtier s room was opened like all the rest   128.1130585869072
but i will repair that wrong upon my word of honor   185.45260399518656
cried the marquis   128.8861296249353
my lord the day after to morrow is pentecost   208.8996588632163
faria still continuing to instruct dantès by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another   65.74447591790243
give it to me said d artagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate   137.01473088231683
when the wind shook all the doors behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled   131.54164117718966
he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him   54.46981346429629
and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet   155.66565132746248
really this is too absurd said villefort   95.40360663885164
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so   205.04010013127174
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him   100.42743350818428
at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene   115.4232468108711
death to the guards   118.10269491198778
and if it is simply what i think that stops you i can obviate the difficulty   134.0733328167303
no no cried dantès   145.56485274156407
while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron s meditations whatever they were the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should dissipate his master s happy reverie   164.9509841279167
cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador   125.35095143491357
and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his   84.83991809749135
said d avrigny   177.89313001916344
mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man   136.43237503852166
do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard   64.21364361258338
well look at my coat of arms it is worth more than morcerf s   87.21711150122093
oh he doesn t stand well with his eminence   73.70479224347888
then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it   61.99053729916294
that i had none as yet   66.95340322221153
well that is scarcely the question   76.40008601194324
how strong and courageous you are   130.3031634404163
the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way   89.21635212542454
go sir said the queen   173.7655086062322
have they allowed the headsman to escape   34.731360476159466
but added he glancing an inquiring look at ali   96.92456167935181
all is ready sire said he   88.02790797994179
it was only a way of speaking   116.59279903281939
so if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first oh   149.06645032931746
i know nothing certain   97.46251994839128
and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts   190.76202896016036
let us therefore strike at wickedness   180.63654509985804
oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter   139.04146522960377
but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m   234.26838092973622
i am not so sure of that   108.74562898611215
anne de bueil murmured the wounded man   61.607833540899286
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation   95.26665447477737
creatures of the people armed with halberds guarding your doors   98.53721345561816
30197m calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling   131.44877820608772
on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other   251.25268568820218
there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall   106.02662082058065
we ll have a supper here under your direction   96.94660719591546
yes i see too plainly that it does exist   110.16344073865773
take courage   151.32164758947224
20311m he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocket book and both began for the third time to count their gold and bank notes   13.919325460575891
said d artagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself   96.18310533769785
we were speaking of hanging   57.429098263693646
grimaud contented himself with pointing d artagnan out to his master with his finger   128.264442994075
yes a fowl   133.61597230307254
may i at least return   92.85063042758527
these leaders had corn in abundance and would not let them partake of it   151.9383977794118
well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end   91.2496776487749
what have you done with monsieur de beaufort   154.5078991256894
it is monte cristo and his greek   155.42471622498311
la ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor   132.30709958109313
he must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken to for milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial   77.11772905772321
but i knew his step i knew his voice i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity   104.04312001310619
this caused a universal burst of laughter   196.43421055744022
i have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend   157.25881193000637
i will keep my word   145.38318793848757
it was true and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning   92.35503536243756
do not think so   75.24466711961475
do   167.68729973154595
a frondeur   115.1742516429767
i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation   140.98543584773415
they are hot royalists said groslow   34.56047781237794
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow   122.98202858727365
bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st   92.10262323680152
no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings   104.96295056409014
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed   70.6943343596246
by my soul said aramis she is charming   45.99913126447008
surely so trifling a circumstance can not deserve a place in your remembrance   72.84510404398154
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other   79.25855752631995
when his patience was exhausted he called his valet   115.14209175939176
liked a pleasant jest   108.13511699511666
at that moment they heard the gallop of a horse   162.2898534536281
besides what did i ask of you   195.4635335391469
the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps   114.57783297044301
what for me only   188.8615256883806
a french nurse who sent me away when i was five years old because no one paid her for me telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak   124.28106392704957
has anything been sent for from a chemist s that i have not examined   141.6052257796061
an astrologer predicted that   79.79537864304022
the sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor   113.53793417746883
i told him very humbly for i could not conceal from myself the scrape i had got into by laying hands on one of his majesty s musketeers i told him i was quite ready to submit to his conditions   142.4600897135652
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in silence   200.76777529897356
i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said debray   85.63372356820221
meanwhile i am the bearer of an order of arrest and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be fulfilled   248.46507832724467
bank notes   110.12584445397866
the abbé the abbé   96.88239964957589
that s right said athos   121.42247166659509
but is this little woman then to escape his eminence   73.24393690504814
yes before witnesses   155.9325454837218
but i wonder she is not here   125.13962406940664
ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners   160.20963913203957
said the brigadier   145.0238990799416
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant if the expression may be used   135.3852377292405
we shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escalade   73.25560463607201
let him be removed from the house that he may not see master edward is not downstairs sir replied the valet   137.43746520637276
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man   65.39823883891805
as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishing boats with their white sails were alone visible   56.23019988976178
exclaimed villefort   86.46439596260689
and he returned to his guests while bertuccio leaning against the wall succeeded in reaching the dining room   214.46229332198718
the procurator repeated several times ah madame coquenard   105.67185757861063
do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time   187.25144740883474
whistled planchet   81.58078825680971
athos and aramis walked down toward the port   108.63699569965817
adieu paris adieu   102.91143273139782
he is a coward indeed grumbled the host drawing near to d artagnan and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before   239.96693859368136
the young man was thrown from the top of the rock   116.45284576404966
well this is what actually took place one evening after an orgy in reinard s apartment at the tuileries with the duc d harcourt fontrailles de rieux and others the duc d harcourt proposed that we should go and pull cloaks on the pont neuf   67.19295248247474
oh no answered the abbé   59.41532227879135
well to take his part   164.8917830831437
each retired to his own apartment   77.838798378492
however as porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to act   90.54114126563587
it is usual certainly   77.5461332372312
here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose   14.437653841027725
everything goes on capitally my dear monsieur bernouin but here is a man whom i must beg you to put in a safe place   96.58992864299465
down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible   148.90080724149757
and you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the stairs   29.882774320161644
the baroness became pale   95.84939672812678
english and french the hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats   126.68006981631378
five hundred pounds   64.47489568632483
oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said   152.67693969100588
he read preserve my memory   131.6012810966637
pardieu cried d artagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinal s money   84.9746390185012
you intend visiting il colosseo   144.4044674877349
come let us talk a little about my father   108.55853153232916
what are you saying doctor   87.54104345352108
but before the notary could answer villefort had drawn him aside   112.75838460058392
if i were still capable of serving you   91.56183742612635
franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth   30.69529794353525
said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated   31.2223646395759
but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father   84.40294743687814
of the d artagnan checked himself   224.96706957535451
said athos rising   96.93543050330943
not even before you philip   73.84872351362647
did you see nothing there   142.39554385951647
the marriage will take place in less than three months said villefort   131.00128995676178
but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his feet   46.32597950793392
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday   78.7292842796803
oh as to his name i know nothing about it   76.94221645067589
her disorders i know them not   112.60024115268808
and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor   115.93929661274296
and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man   119.75808895723814
what the devil do you want with a member of the parliament   56.34335321701067
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman   76.01728873550942
perhaps he would say nothing but he would see   121.23697759897682
i deserted the church for the world for you know that i forced myself when i became a musketeer   142.88864757209157
before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you   126.2002883385714
cried porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit   170.64495154252728
the bedclothes were thrown back exposing the king s bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen   97.74215998102662
shall we go together   179.2669359327652
now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father s mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank   35.6434490218094
then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored   108.75961342400808
that of dying together   50.59769628810166
my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all   160.06477631655068
but madame henrietta is a daughter of france and was entitled to the hospitality of france   200.76858653413137
do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his eminence is indisposed   125.90499976320642
he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me   143.9361637183625
and then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend   103.9460224389234
exclaimed villefort unable to repress an exclamation   62.88168555976932
on the contrary she often says morcerf i believe the count has a noble nature   0.9306145573107756
athos waved his hand raoul bowed and d artagnan and planchet set out   88.18089860625959
who was the invisible chief   88.41137570317649
at this time athos came up to d artagnan   131.3306058581207
it was you who finding the balls had missed their mark sent poisoned wine with a forged letter to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends   107.8145825441174
why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the tiber and the smugglers of the coast   109.75485081090052
pistache my friend come here   167.4264492400964
take care i repeat to you take care   139.93437983516992
i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied   184.2020278668947
but how to die   229.98108703796484
do you repent   99.64106698761367
besides he wore the uniform of the guards which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies   135.91886303321587
i have charged myself with this affair   219.70801726719847
always   83.50442606183249
mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the gascon began to laugh at him and said porthos would be angry my dear monsieur mousqueton but i pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gay come along   169.83101694779157
40164m then i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you too   90.4416054876782
and aramis pushed forward a large easy chair in which d artagnan stretched himself out   180.79198733422453
s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire   123.3263792685851
de tréville wanted   102.52118691509104
you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not   108.20182384077842
baptistin bowed   98.40656229522014
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose   98.31737078675933
but now answer me   208.1312751395002
the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh   72.72269142600943
the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs élysées   71.07141516517943
besides whether at home or not whether in paris or cairo the abbé always left something to give away which the valet distributed through this wicket in his master s name   189.00563715626606
no everyone would do that   141.40940940290798
and that reminds me that i have a revenge to take   109.92495644757602
dessessart and the company of musketeers of m   141.88560461851426
shame shame for four musketeers to allow an unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst   164.74752752793663
at the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in adelmonte s country   137.10917883089402
why having recognized you and i the only one to do so why was i able to save my son alone   67.72169591859206
the duke was the grandson of henry iv   56.58768684864718
so much the worse or rather so much the better   91.0086844226666
certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence   116.59653077193055
and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you   149.62616718789815
how you will go   58.25949454946059
d artagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it   154.9071971546049
whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dantès instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty   85.81648289648837
now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work   173.99371078542973
she fainted   2.7538381902034956
we are compelled to admit to our readers that d artagnan thought nothing about him in any way   109.71608007268446
that is of no consequence   121.52016934040006
we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud   114.29736954899964
speak out   205.91695534632169
the thing is simple enough   61.37135592668167
said buckingham becoming so pale that d artagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal   96.21307590124424
you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free   200.21778870288819
they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself   99.21247881382506
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him   185.1359686225461
and that is injurious to you among the women   135.65872331207134
to do with you my lord   65.35488642036378
no said valentine you might meet someone   87.31407168080281
but he flew into terrible rage   100.334026341184
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man i will let the count know that you are here   160.278515094996
go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it   182.7460888111348
that is not an answer replied athos   150.20725590170468
oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again   141.06318201313246
as for you who are young and active delay not on my account but fly go i give you back your promise   87.6000669548185
my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them   112.78961295425275
grimaud alone was calm as ever   64.65772813639735
maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows   108.0257048800398
one would think it had been placed here on purpose   100.53821172984689
at that period i did not even know what time meant   52.524628465813635
you are alone one alone shall answer you   154.25153695515868
look at his uniform monsieur commissary look at his uniform   112.98776250612426
if we ever escape together half this treasure is yours   77.01702468193292
as soon as we are married he shall come and live with us instead of one child he shall have two   91.53373178026108
but tell me does the count of morcerf never visit the opera   156.46464351368667
haydée will soon be here   138.32574126064532
i told you so athos said d artagnan shrugging his shoulders   90.7412885126679
i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness   129.21286657951237
why do you say that   47.29010872498189
now if i entreat if i order you to live morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life   117.86116596842278
why he imprisoned himself i swear to you he did   153.36774694130014
what did he answer   168.9011288398906
by my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied aramis for even i feel a shudder at the recollection   114.55348707340224
on arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the guardsmen fell   186.1694649981918
at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile   47.44486110127832
a man is there who picks it up   26.53993889283619
i beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier   134.02096746622195
no but i heard all   121.89085538749465
the muskets are for us   107.91120438560745
i have still fifty pistoles   51.37420896493421
cahusac turned   134.09337192059587
by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry   91.73672174835153
this affair made a great noise   97.78704648437323
he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about   250.4711273761359
during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath   130.9563564244072
pass through turin chambéry and pont de beauvoisin   113.68564034884452
de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father   155.09475134432606
these words of felton s passed like ice through her veins   53.469772070171715
i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn said buckingham   219.01585121260337
beauchamp one of the kings of the press and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere was eying everybody through his monocle   124.231867042294
i was not willing to fly   170.49514093978456
they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority   165.3039975935851
the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him   191.6302232727646
well what good wind blows you hither at this hour   128.21068332244513
at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door again   154.049082525853
when you return i will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you can not be recognized by them   88.12131490931216
you are the master   197.12075075841167
murmured fernand   149.8478199469475
now said d artagnan for the actual man   165.83555469574407
said i are you pleased   84.65120362070496
i searched the whole thicket   35.17784238866783
tis mordaunt   102.0842862614034
de guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him   93.05428495997687
if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil   125.97293723498146
julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen   50.0392504882158
now if you marry m   135.55984602722498
the count bowed his head and clasped his hands together   95.53886407329762
we are ready   22.2386935715205
for like diana of poictiers and ninon anne of austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful   69.28652549109657
provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously   82.71996172531036
and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm   151.9440450431788
i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage   175.5080549691279
come will you do to day what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen   146.31837208711372
they did not come   135.8284888583344
i don t know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you are speaking my lord   150.47811688414293
the morning drum had just been beaten   23.163974722176206
what are your commands lieutenant   105.98109633725214
i had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel son   42.50116801639142
40026m i am prejudiced against beauchamp said albert drawing franz away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with debray   121.73243940726452
after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair   10.56116433100695
soon as kitty left him d artagnan directed his steps toward the rue férou   162.31692811281022
ah you are there said she at length turning towards fernand   105.38755775394972
said he in the most natural tone in the world   175.0859225448855
the old man obeyed   168.41379148350848
it was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it   43.83721440096819
and ask the uncle whether i was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew   139.76271719005237
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy   55.36329766977228
they will be ten times worse off in a week   159.51089841782505
valentine groaned   98.3187261655729
he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling   165.2787113163156
you are only the victim of perfidious plots   139.22690996716432
that is to say she was there replied milady   140.76757123338805
i have eight men on guard you know   141.36719110760703
chapter 39   142.68169014198008
all the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man particularly when that young man is a musketeer had disappeared as if by enchantment   98.60565672817455
have you any weight on the chest   160.72424413595252
i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me   159.25178374353206
said buckingham looking at felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them   139.4504457302665
grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety   88.43464218052743
tell your mistress he at length answered that i wish to speak to her and i beg she will wait for me in her own room   164.23616100714193
it is only used for political prisoners   45.10544542475145
they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived and the bell and bottle being the best known hotel in the town they had naturally directed their first inquiries there   59.82362190028212
but as m   80.07889367956187
he turned up a king   83.91277231462958
but do you not fear to find him a bully   133.40676965667717
the king was winning   126.03504240058118
he had but one fault he was a gourmand   33.791002980426384
adieu brother   135.09252796090925
i know it and i have nothing more to say   171.54342540086043
she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son   134.2159942817587
in the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in bed   181.47549910703668
d artagnan remained therefore alone   39.32021724737281
he knows how as you must have observed to obey an order for you did not i am sure come from portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak   165.82023774581455
repeated the astonished caderousse   185.46719057744085
the rascal is rich then   83.98513196443537
they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache   20.51485588676269
and perhaps become even less than he is   156.4723562960034
may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences   78.38218110887202
valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy   71.28659931958461
and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows   210.96425694112634
no no by no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground   111.61177909832865
but this last circumstance was not striking as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much   155.5892761437104
at the moment he was about to go out lord de winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of milady   169.60672647066886
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m   162.91409644246204
devil take it my lord   62.822489116663576
and at the first sound of the leader s bow across his violin franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl who turned around to say a few words to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on   165.6632694728737
i can not tell you   83.92925296051693
oh it is impossible said he i must be dreaming   104.19709087492109
and he sent them to you   71.48379768755777
if when you have seen me again you still persist well then you shall be free and i myself will give you the weapon you desire   80.98654293237965
muttered mazarin i do believe he is going off with the diamond   98.58513179490777
he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of mercédès   76.88199871355212
i have my pride for men serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot   104.80998784693718
this was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant   84.3964607317946
this way   87.37061668505528
still further monsieur de tréville gains ten thousand crowns a year   118.21666797012749
they must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to armentières each by a different route   83.25651763022094
bartholomew they sometimes came to seek refuge   44.87472634799926
and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment   81.77581827816331
do you think so m   166.40661533387174
why should you not be there   120.9611827723972
asked the commissary   113.46659242084728
he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk   73.58974037654056
this time maximilian was the first to arrive   97.312485918592
and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor   101.61889176017219
and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group   100.06401136170068
armentières read porthos   61.085834260597494
no replied morcerf my father is most anxious about it   108.26462050987932
yesterday i said this mass again   143.66960421010393
nothing said milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile   98.14920213127316
as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent   35.82632661064167
from heaven replied d artagnan shaking his head   102.00145995715987
yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises   63.526069802289506
but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker   98.37018841258539
franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted   123.61690132742234
but first tell me were you going out or just returned   113.34320362478971
she comes from india also   149.29402805060866
to be sure there would only be a swiss the less in the world   137.2212753709367
as to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found shut   176.6134451253791
cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in   88.91834821360644
anne of austria was then twenty six or twenty seven years of age   106.0187011326958
go away from here and leave the place to us   144.499381974732
it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps   176.14711709688055
and i also i was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke   116.66130748905256
athos was the last to enter   160.1830722787542
what are we to say to this   15.390124673409048
at the noise made by d artagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend   191.84589412738927
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground   181.1083915062359
we will not go till evening   168.6661495663161
danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation   84.85767654971316
dost know where porthos is   155.951216368084
not to me i hope   140.51690876421992
and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today let us say no more about it   125.18529279919552
there are the acts signed   133.78921483765123
our four friends in particular astonished their comrades   133.25117738114298
now i can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it   65.64983631986652
you were sent by some other person   51.26442782023987
opposite the scaffold   75.99833008450952
and as m   102.5947205238881
he commanded with it   80.49830829119276
messieurs porthos and aramis repeated athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman   48.72974932220046
because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability   175.72710890896934
but never mind he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time so he s welcome   95.63592199865843
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all   171.42783361449474
what is yonder   47.539659366889495
the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars said château renaud   162.59377240943476
what the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it   160.75236597006196
you wish me to get out at that window   156.3475909999985
but we must say farewell edmond and let us part   103.90960639208737
of which i invite you to take advantage my friend   75.96985947324376
winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on   90.85517918523996
oh no it has not   127.3545955439868
i really don t know what hotel it is   25.452456648808607
possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor   168.01614137879562
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room   147.50661982883514
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal   41.45552578525586
pray reflect a little   124.843190092701
the three musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses   53.94654532847882
and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect   111.85708328319583
chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its weight   130.42971816042748
at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people   92.30031583547107
he looked around   118.62656005871214
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king   87.84644029375903
but sit down dear friend to table   132.0131739627791
it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chateau   101.04872190518797
d artagnan did not love his son who was his only offspring but m   113.68433213487094
gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag   165.09905263794636
de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant   151.36227927232613
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife   169.00568103526277
suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horsemen   207.7689813339705
de monte cristo digging underneath these trees found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there   189.4899182283469
yes i know what brand you are talking about   155.84924776289012
my mistress sir   133.33923480265952
de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismounted   108.98280577413591
he was in a most elegant hunting costume   148.5867648984269
he possesses a noble heart madame replied the count and he has acted rightly   131.85784741241534
answer or we charge   195.12146353920915
mordaunt reappeared   138.3833302632208
will you accept my offering   131.4260886897501
well done planchet   103.43090949659877
so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death   219.80241382321685
and he set off to follow the two friends   121.9130634530922
when her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face   112.01064627586925
has the sun done anything for me   53.696951150500325
then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom   132.2456717369654
it must be so my son said anne of austria   153.74657143561723
at your age   148.8051178577102
athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall   52.080230372940676
return to paris said he   124.34806474650435
his voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and half naked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his hands   107.51333625771895
but i love her my lord and was jealous   153.5311588865059
gentlemen said château renaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriage   162.06435738530882
he is in masquerade   49.06968954587164
my brother is only your second husband   57.273001328890665
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir   144.31450735016358
for the comte de la fère it is too little   74.08425106327411
the englishmen bowed and went upstairs   35.002409688318565
and the man held the torch to the wall   236.12238786116146
i certainly am surprised replied m   15.634198633113357
debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain   92.42505846526967
50261m i am he whom you sold and dishonored i am he whose betrothed you prostituted i am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortune i am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger i am he whom you also condemned to starvation and who yet forgives you because he hopes to be forgiven i am edmond dantès   82.61716796663694
the duke s endeavors evinced the best intention in the world but one of the precautions taken at vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to keep no money   120.11019010283755
to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition   87.61868379050907
she was a nun in the convent of the benedictines of templemar   115.43070459237364
chapter lxviii   19.981901045000583
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture   107.03756012652241
shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron   148.94146615450893
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth   104.06984843845457
many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the foot of st   164.515151876505
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and i come back still more weary and low spirited that s all   56.68689641211071
at the end of three quarters of a league within fifty paces of festubert a larger bloodstain appeared   210.5663582558889
buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a workshop   119.79890810679528
you are abused sir   104.87966165167222
from him whom you have rendered the happiest of men comte de wardes this note was in the first place a forgery   86.08728910489229
and i will save them all   135.49751369099442
is she going to fall in love with me by chance this fair inconstant   142.23605393785382
both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard it was full of gunpowder   137.32101429895144
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries   151.31180944500812
d avrigny in the same pitiless tone m   162.60097447236765
besides they are to come to paris in about a month and valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m   100.14836915272677
monsieur bonacieux chapter xiv   143.66916910139528
so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive   119.12704226431642
two   110.07719752060135
the host drew back and burst into tears   125.4117351403454
sir replied m   131.52299145115916
well my lord what i foresaw has come to pass   76.02171850742722
what do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper and where can i look for these better than in you   138.26444624973067
beauchamp was in his bath   77.57809324121925
i will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes your excellency   62.16558985998574
he is at constantinople   70.01660529565137
franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle   96.51177388701069
martin the same at which they had stopped on their first journey   146.11111462058417
come back sirs back   175.47212334606294
noirtier looked the permission which she solicited   25.66874114757303
is he still as stingy as ever   143.88643043241666
only be back again in three months for the pharaon added the owner patting the young sailor on the back can not sail without her captain   169.35556141610073
go on my good parry unless you are tired   116.55186641556806
let us see said athos   100.8269509923453
it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting   37.42325096596737
pardon me excellency said peppino placing his hand on the banker s shoulder   76.39435435709689
by the streets   102.59607026185655
and i own that if you have no stronger proof to give me i have another replied maximilian   150.30243465456985
a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head   145.07766530185907
and in that strange manner they approached the louvre   121.66916047438107
penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad   34.37688985062242
the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter   236.30073249232478
with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand   23.42326684863764
and in half an hour said maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored   92.05170520399
as d artagnan had foreseen athos was not within   148.68915411747776
a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in   93.6871027650287
i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other   212.64651823686353
each word that fell from his companion s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth   105.18408439246427
and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables   153.06280759894457
d artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable   49.729653476211666
we must be expeditious   157.1688438195116
hold your tongue porthos said athos   142.63490334566944
bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of st   9.598774421470836
i faith yes   142.97364634680864
to give ten francs to this honest fellow replied raoul taking a pistole from his pocket   78.33462025575042
exclaimed cromwell   71.85989633893746
inquired the countess   192.61159072109666
i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued   143.52542466054427
when he is absent i am there   111.16817697185347
i left him five days ago said d artagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds   153.49640583528551

go to the assistance of madame de villefort he said to the nurse   119.52898839336919
aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment   121.12982371883716
nothing escapes him   134.02426183952778
he now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer   134.24820746708212
that is an idea   128.49895912530172
florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same   134.16298883772484
in a few minutes he had extracted three boards   78.34162315863114
of course naively replied the servant   80.63870197848667
precisely monsieur replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze   163.64176232149973

the door of the back staircase opened then the side gate of the garden and ali and his master were on the spot with lights   38.96132443168712

and don t you know where he is   105.86317739817511
i am a prisoner then   195.7156215991688
this screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects   132.66729486676388
he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead sea   145.47190037124574
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos   149.95117606793588

but you have the first claim m   94.28900913404455

by aramis is meant simara which is the name of a demon   125.84182716179593
but he heard nothing   105.21126216734913
your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor   140.78855473354017
but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd   130.24326840104686
ah yes i am indeed deserted   69.14618297402819
the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain   80.19445438422548
this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twenty five men   110.35152428675646
but you madame prudent as you are think if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief and that handkerchief were to be seized would you not be compromised   100.82462439546053
all along the road what athos had said respecting mme   188.88512290692717
sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with a bland smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment   94.75677011606165
answer it   118.15565133791279
said athos we are overheard   103.7542834997994
and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris   120.81052825278886
that is what we must find out returned gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star   135.70231554549412

one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him   92.6346412566755
i really do not think after all it is anything of consequence   41.99460860851305
but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her emotion   140.06200750870113
have you seen   48.970680931938475
however that may be d artagnan replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true   119.07605350994609
edmond uttered a cry of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the door exclaiming help help   174.50892853382948
it was the count de rochefort   146.55799955086744
come i beseech you lend me twenty francs so that i may buy a dressing gown   122.80078898883363

he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning   105.72890591041299
fortunately he fancied that dantès was delirious   70.0349601927447
aramis because you are a knight of malta and won t mix with fellows like us   138.86409073666235

and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility   147.21659614083075
she crushed the paper in her hand and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty she cried what is this letter   128.5268760564138
of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay and of surrendering only to fifty men   56.694741364023244
cried haydée   109.12466015277006
bonacieux dead and to d artagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life   122.9046863589992
after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out doctor doctor   99.11082841242082
they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends   97.67373829694446
carmela was attired like a woman of sonnino   136.17254118722317
alas stammered villefort i do not lose a single word   40.14709728805242
the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that château renaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion   143.04112662188555
de villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said   171.07183120511493
you heard m   9.283791502174893
groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him company   136.674326578561
porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand in   78.46946154672162
a smile lit up the old man s face a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face   115.01769337787923
planchet said he   143.6668356914219
you were walking one day behind the chartreux when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere   151.95928449558454
caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven   138.9576074738767
said the gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his friends   108.72701313631616
as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him   10.624998203769067
she is besides my sole heiress   55.22005934307532

that we may be discovered   155.13771385743712
at last we are off   148.33040124101802
and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia   136.912882580914
cried d artagnan in a loud voice   99.92442417631572
this is something new replied the king   202.36163709719466
he was a merchant monsieur and had succeeded to the business of my poor father   98.71470982613411
your comrade   139.437645367889
at four o clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables   108.06110147990542
but it s of no importance continued d artagnan with natural assurance   59.01270281008223
cried he guardian of the fire do your duty   188.7893570189716
oh dear no your excellency   81.98556252912147
de tréville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you   153.26816034988389
i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor   147.02173436850632
it was midnight   148.95916513143428
monte cristo descended into the courtyard walked all over the house without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure until he entered his bedroom situated on the opposite side to the closed room   92.13777059948538
i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go   119.92106860744202
well baron what is there difficult to understand about that   106.73443637973583
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead   40.46247157741088
he had hastened to milady s chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution d artagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered felton   112.20278005565184
i have but one man on board and i am as sure of him as i am of myself   85.11317143650581

would you like me to send edward to you for a short time   103.48700129489619
making no reply grimaud opened the poor man s jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn   131.81216021648223
the meetings were always held from that time till midnight   153.38699757272184
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest   105.84842940617389
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded   95.38162131641825
i will find him as i told you   100.30794493865359
the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance   146.42389576526503
well madame said mazarin bowing i desire that you give me a share in your friends as i have shared with you the little industry and talent that heaven has given me   130.52111273538839
the prince   98.17353407129767
then they returned to the rospoli palace   107.23608965975046
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period   98.51470376528404
it is a long rectangle divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners   144.0664025536694
allow me allow me sir said d artagnan to observe you are in error   180.99983781997008
it is nothing however but a wine of the country   190.94495374550024
i don t doubt it   107.6283012331875
the lieutenant s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing room   83.86710160019882
be it understood we are speaking of athos   151.01499427621965
any one except grimaud   105.61483173562833
four conveyed him away i don t know where to the bastille or fort l evêque   80.88286974830154
said bonacieux slapping a plump round bag which returned of sound a money   144.95872940984498
athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a bas relief   178.17123722333082
was i not nearly your husband   145.07399032766094
franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet him   148.5367107270423
yes said madame danglars that is she   96.93070696768918
the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of d artagnan if the wine had been bad   43.79284378274788
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy   171.64035936630788
this is the gentleman i am going to fight with said athos pointing to d artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture   192.70419072242333
but how my god   175.64045221575273
but the women will ruin you   147.05391668723766
and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week   170.64386260270524
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count s pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting   55.17555404113905
yes and france is about to pay for her king s refusal with a war   124.44757167118922
if anything yet remains of that great that sublime king henry of whom you have just spoken he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself   200.29974410410105
i will be a sailor   102.70631090863282
grimaud had now finished his accounts   124.1777162115893
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot   65.41681552885669
the voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell   88.24105634017872
now said the count what will you take a glass of sherry port or alicante   101.7624919341383
i shall soon return   116.74376991816972
i shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a café   157.83319597374998
he rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive   106.5259259684246
it ought to do so at least   144.6615555868793
i have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow   60.95282964522835
he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner   84.25167394206952
propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out   106.86000608929153
was the woman handsome   54.05698119607574
why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother   113.9683515339222
all at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me start   196.90428526115159
yes added athos i now ask you d artagnan what side you are on   106.96460378762946
it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications   163.29949524201692
certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès arrested   152.5268094076769
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards   177.6668277634179
madame bonacieux found again   139.14670731678837
and though he s but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear athos i shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me   123.50812304443912
then not a word but set to work   155.3856978788616
said the latter with apparent coolness but with deep emotion have you another invalid   72.17236716301086
d artagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction stay you where you are and don t you stir or i will pull this ear off   93.68209458974466
it is i said athos and what is the name of the person   103.52527585417714
the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinner party at auteuil he slept soundly   68.05041576158908
a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly   88.00629472287864
but what makes you sigh   143.3266604207251
he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent   100.37985400664554
charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it   140.00299405088234
have you ever seen the tuileries   224.0203317295572
pardon me my friend   143.80482124212966
you ought to be satisfied   227.56484214855607
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation   53.72554992455759
should you be glad to hear that the comte de la fere is well   172.93362049350284
you have saved my life once save me again   109.16888008779219
it is indeed thee   84.60807473170551
oh if such a thought could present itself i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it   120.10065416450851
are you going to rejoin your cardinal   157.10575116908188
i hope you have a sword at home   91.10284225473889
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell   152.23283928842204
d artagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them   109.2733392594526
but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d artagnan recognized the coadjutor   130.07653422770287
stammered d artagnan   109.73693747365247
my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the papers   51.547943468687635
ah wooi a vager   75.54565480542787
i am in the power of men upon whom i can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite   109.87871167793783
will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count s room and in ten minutes all will be settled   128.03462963140132
replied athos with a deep sigh   147.60780267900134
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police   59.685257844226946
explain to me   115.82797334775375
she exclaimed as he entered   92.69154710925413
no returned she but i feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation   171.53373530336495
de chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment   131.81150568035042
you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you   154.3671769336061
do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing   177.42069239696957
there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied faria but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison   183.84726583047993
oh gentlemen   91.61534078153895
i had chosen this text tell me dear d artagnan if it is not to your taste non inutile est desiderium in oblatione   116.59494929803898
the past and the future   120.5916994091548
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon   196.09003551069864
thanks guitant   168.99514949356097
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story   170.22599604226272
one day we received a letter   132.74869335302355
30269m the chest no longer there   150.18790099195888
that is to say whom you do not like returned the queen   136.51346288196228
he received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the parliament of bretagne   198.54074440272007
the appointed hour was about to strike   53.033555818304094
of whom i have spoken to you madame   9.883413328014498
but aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke s finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him   151.95451130927972
when arrived there the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all   114.22605602518499
as they approached the piazza del popolo the crowd became more dense and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the point where the three streets del babuino del corso and di ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaïa   161.40731700209943
he will treat me better the next time i see him   133.03560783254923
and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation   66.91479140968949
provincial diffidence that slight varnish the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three musketeers gave their friend   138.02149052002667
you are on the contrary adorable   152.56780091244482
go go   72.55221182767566
glasses were elevated in the air à l anglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures   104.46216363237578
the rest concerns another person   127.97389837508803
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand   44.737818237863806
but said d artagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal   76.14598585971939
he raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the passage   126.5832054818372
i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france   186.594499547152
the matter was no longer doubtful   65.1766785011218
and who told you to defend the king   161.83152949225186
d artagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled curses   77.02508992518068
bless me   96.0348427388588
and at what distance   151.77852371567522
it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan   90.34152920618867
he bowed   111.83585477043678
come i feel ill here and the two young men spurred on   67.2976390981462
yes grandpapa said valentine   122.80852107519594
putting the letter in her bosom she took her son s arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs   169.3004511081661
sir said the prudent planchet in the first place are you on good terms with monsieur de rochefort   112.54791005262673
happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admirably in men s clothes   126.73294446937811
do you know him then   118.70854703940005
maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence   76.18789312134419
it is not of my wife i hope   172.05958781056216
i don t know what devil of an insect stung me and made me ambitious   123.45998736286988
her dress which was that of the women of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls   115.70880077126473
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction   55.486382587161174
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when d artagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand   93.62032153388435
my lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me   162.99524195468635
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses   164.42723857651396
i have no right to it   165.8206424093534
the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply   57.85148507445474
athos glanced at aramis   56.60591139968842
for according to the advice of aramis it was prudent to sow repasts right and left in prosperity in order to reap a few in time of need   141.49596816361225
but now you are happy   93.06074708723047
you are to obey the commands of the personage to whom i have addressed the inclosed letter   141.2497695602305
then is it not resumed the duke the superintendent emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building   144.1280502351217
i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me   118.2875273433549
monte cristo shuddered   73.22065502882099
of course said he   115.62715354073028
faithful friend noble heart   148.4791968582471
daughter of one of your majesty s most faithful servants   155.6180066396405
morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to dantès on the subject   125.18691145136695
from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice   133.73378143519608
the valet de chambre announced m   90.74269707936583
bonacieux mechanically yes let us be gone   87.00336612280532
grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man   110.07207358865418
but hush here comes somebody   123.15034510746324
he has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed   62.33535860564003
40100m no   129.80320228313332
but it is with men that i struggle and i am but a woman to them   151.72395813676349
then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was   109.47563476976121
i know not if he heard these words   175.90730169019332
one morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use   124.96416402080698
and the best hack   124.8646853945327
the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse   113.97294371266518
really my dear monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me   174.4802914790265
it was to visit her king henry iv   148.99727945776874
and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification here is in addition to the price of the studs an order for a thousand pistoles to make you forget the annoyance i cause you   82.8580771488603
athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by d artagnan   106.03967313906938
but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with anger   105.84625212962482
for your father is indeed here and is seeking you   53.34160801600289
was there not a marriage engagement between you and mademoiselle de saint méran   91.53878897891084
have you no information as to his abiding place   46.78921414328303
ah i recognize you i recognize you   162.76383540263504
by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence   84.31834080787928
the countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart   138.366892115228
business like persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer   88.55928677787941
and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more aggravated   138.20428698285957
oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness   194.98187130955566
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future   184.84926976193032
who has told me this fine story monsieur   86.70179785050018
here is a soup which is rather inviting   62.900754397599606
milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word   100.33363352708113
almost screamed the countess   116.24324965427206
hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them   88.42371030770758
our holy father the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services he rendered to the christians in the east   128.7258231140185
ah i understand you said the unhappy man   53.79474123557103
others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied thereto   56.02176613294717
and what is it to be   72.07709105966813
you know we can not yet pronounce him guilty   126.33441899788991
he remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed him   91.41199416729049
they thought this order did not concern me sir   113.22514395503309
address yourself to m   168.59950874745869
noirtier i resolved to try one last means and for three months i have been giving him brucine   37.19285596096083
50269m i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning   91.50595590646122
does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday   161.75441985504375
faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed   79.16779337373595
you have seen the count you say   153.7561294856876
he is my demon apparently   102.6967008744017
my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m   104.71975361166028
on entering the banker s mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of m   39.61034887070841
the two gentlemen were exasperated   117.11396090393437
yes yes to be sure kitty said d artagnan   204.48022742609493
dreaming   113.55282447276429
what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer   145.7669186480292
is it known why   121.04683759406475
he stopped however at the door for an instant   23.142808778508837
porthos linked his arm in that of his friend   145.75837394198578
stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million   175.22942618438935
and with how many fingers does he bless   95.40350748454412
wait then wait   152.12083831879013
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces   99.56447373744926
d artagnan s ball took off his enemy s hat   208.33723413430835
the coadjutor started   242.50512254130712
i have just left him answered caderousse   181.47688501495395
most undoubtedly replied monte cristo   115.19752825407616
noirtier said madame de villefort   98.3149408811627
threaten to speak and i will condemn you to infamy   118.99247220905788
groslow began turning the cards one after another   78.34827921662509
replied monte cristo with bitter irony   31.003010277958737
mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond   96.3825519607966
oh why is not the world a wilderness   114.66783099790999
bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by terror   102.24830145284791
but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness   115.68758727474726
every day   185.41290825900091
mouston has a very fine appearance   79.26561235068553
if he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and then so much the better all would be over   110.73306802580858
seek him at once   170.41447590870857
let us first send for two soldiers said the governor   143.83800332208156
he could not help thinking of m   126.21539383378233
that horse was to have identified us in the day of battle   143.43369905421503
and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction   101.97056647549434
with the sun gaiety revived   127.4069212751496
it was like the eve of a battle   147.82013202886768
my father   79.64722852106033
i have a father who is seventy if he yet lives   41.310180222804334
it would not be astonishing   81.74389457989028
and so am i replied athos   80.52832077930827
in exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen   167.92467186208265
we have seen many other such   127.14750180081137
i m afraid we are prisoners whispered d artagnan to his friend   159.36801008987567
what i propose to do is fair in war   164.1645381500691
a waiter opened the door   103.53451667691256
grimaud began to scale the wall again   144.66018380468265
it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat   130.77093150481343
the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him   98.72534052348331
suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleon well can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellow creatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey   90.53115421410722
luigi arrived first   157.99166720396735
tomorrow morning   100.9163179822688
fools said charles do they take me for a coward like themselves   147.33249771365564
the young people felt a mutual esteem   71.43192859081688
why replied monte cristo since we mutually understand each other for such i presume is the case   110.93312811673653
you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head   113.48459762822011
the assizes also were about to begin and villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse   83.75416624424214
let us be open with each other and sincere   105.81428944150714
now sir you have but to say the word and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms   188.11410868398895
the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts   134.01987018965875
till tomorrow evening then   102.04115130750883
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity   157.46817047366085
can i do anything for you gentlemen   113.09908844066251
50203m before you quit us count said julie will you permit us to express to you all that the other day madame interrupted the count taking her two hands in his all that you could say in words would never express what i read in your eyes   128.5634665887655
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said patrick   120.07918975881115
do not despair   67.63507043543424
then he said to himself i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody   113.34238580119302
he will be one as he says cried porthos   93.63930879954358
and i hope to prove to you that you have not served an ingrate   81.29687756074517
no not tomorrow morning if you please but immediately   150.62574756740415
everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey   165.3746689412879
chapter 70   242.67503526444867
and i shall always do so replied d avrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind   175.39356506559506
the three musketeers   54.05049025031862
you are examining my den said aramis   132.94155266458083
true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest   104.8856210675185
that s against all rules   65.84087818939123
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain   169.75843060897455
chapelain   253.38833993623152
my lord what have you done with your sister your sister who was my mother   112.07683590505502
and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will   81.17021147291814
and tell me did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume   91.07482448219949
pardon me you are right   129.9335510423118
that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards   170.6998169775389
you have evidently seen and observed everything   159.80376259161767
it seems you are right planchet   235.7266606413455
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew   142.60144517169473
your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which i am deputed to see you   130.68676395855246
de chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrigues   142.65561049187934
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a music room for julie who never played   113.45835562372768
they soon arrived at the silent solitary inn   168.45850381228283
in the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice let the justice of god be done   134.84663159292438
is it heaven that opens before me   149.71122078107214
and as i am a gentleman i keep my word   130.82560079534963
he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court   135.2284134493411
what did the prince do then   66.84152155141092
milady de boulogne evening of the twenty fifth   182.9788948086354
why the music you have been listening to   178.67701270768325
i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you   138.00062851136138
tis well resumed the king   116.82774404654033
what can they have done with him   120.98071740020016
i need to know whether i am among enemies or friends   184.42397846442287
friends   0.3001309889637582
a mendicant   185.8140561966044
his health hurrah   136.55869092450442
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion   141.54888607050748
you wished to double it and how   144.93205582750895
dantès said danglars bowing to the young couple   57.875859851544405
and we are four one for one   72.05516977055674
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century chapter xi   187.26680688844073
three curates remained those of st   173.9997280141981
she was of a noble family of fiesole count   94.0361722176296
laporte pointed to the child who was asleep   94.33971533780439
come come enough of such compliments   105.4357435075049
and did you catch any of his words   92.3061143532775
what could he say   100.57587592506167
monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests   146.36477496455788
valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since half past eight and did not see you come   70.54713745318043
if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden   140.01496290716935
but milady started up pushing her away   65.2152722951816
the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation   134.6231349151035
the king s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of athos s heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom   51.09474021282044
it is for me to reply to that   85.17137267182584
i do not know but he wishes to speak to you   40.16027668879249
cried the young girl while raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster   159.72113311328854
and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit   131.94751033453994
at this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said the passports are in order   75.54365391545437
yes it is indeed he   184.74605513828527
depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you   98.29168102650412
d artagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend porthos   139.4801200353991
then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which i am accustomed to give you every sunday   177.84017146160625
burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words   158.08289961075616
stop rascal   148.91893190827446
thanks my dear friend said madame danglars trying to smile   126.8645614291215
i thought as much said d artagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts   101.24463192643424
at half past one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and albert   126.99418056831182
upon which the stranger asked his name and learning that it was porthos and not d artagnan he assisted him to rise brought him back to the hôtel mounted his horse and disappeared   131.70471335594866
what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another   125.94330004871335
stammered morcerf   215.64386743601813
a great misfortune more important to me than life   85.98734025265273
andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents   106.20734024198524
my cloak said grimaud from the bottom of the hold   147.92295038653566
she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color   134.081681942274
cried d artagnan beside himself with joy   150.9020359663152
it is right said athos   144.9228621394988
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive   64.87193393409581
well if you do not go this very instant i will have you arrested by the queen s orders and i will have you placed in the bastille which you dread so much   102.11968378019286
on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever   73.90432313089086
but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold   184.34135132230932
when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheard of that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs   196.07966409026182
is she then preparing for a stroke   165.83915085347098
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him   73.56591509955868
but grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step   87.21710944461017
yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent i might have prevented benedetto from killing you   75.6804634041628
besides i am here in my own country and that excites me   146.31572163903047
but they did not do so with m   132.34000824699106
i allowed it to become quite dark   80.21835081662724
but in what carriage do we start   157.3397750914825
then he turned to the officer   106.64842458825478
i swear to heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him i will fall upon them   149.79122296428875
in his projects of intrigue for the future and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune d artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them   211.4095975778389
send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic   161.28718198299728
but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king   106.94271775805242
that man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done so   134.3066957944718
well then i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back   70.28053135474586
again interposed some of the audience   56.39544871916757
d artagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their posts   54.1776026669751
gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us   86.80741811846224
but his majesty s decision is always necessary   106.84481593328704
chevalier said the king when the door was closed i believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions   186.23706237144694
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse   78.84563594460806
the fleur de lis is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices   155.96305062881964
in june the profit amounted to 900 000   135.14661549521043
dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous   132.12984788391995
here is a beautiful lawn   242.76567291927955
this man is still your friend and you perhaps make use of him as your accomplice   165.90812377635552
well said albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and i insist on a retractation being made   128.2625508885526
his host here was a good fellow from picardy who gave him all the information he needed   102.99407516659225
soldiers are big children   91.20271903039536
d artagnan of the king s guards company dessessart is expected at the palais cardinal this evening at eight o clock   94.64534670582154
you will have sufficient time before five o clock   64.96464336276334
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose   66.38496814530112
i was there at a fearful moment   130.3093438829237
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspector s visit but a dream an illusion of the brain   96.00072013819907
and the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his companion   190.93837653617243
the eye of aramis kindled in spite of himself   86.36579632406097
but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them   100.8542642021489
that was the sloop   133.6871364208025
you owe me no thanks   113.81893129720994
pray let me know who you really are   49.593369986279555
in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart   95.3338084498892
the executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his arm   108.36835651226208
then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then 900 000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40 000 livres   87.95394081846987
yes were it only out of curiosity   44.91653134962773
villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught   111.93314191448735
and yet said athos with his habitual calmness if it be monsieur d artagnan who is concerned in this matter i do not perceive how i can take his place   31.997376926294635
as for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there conveniently ready   77.5054693943531
i lost him then with all his appointments and furniture   108.0491525548635
there is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de winter in an ironical contemptuous tone   69.31761076039257
and yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies   109.53872440544171
that s another matter   124.9671833908628
against my murderer   146.4224680256473
it is indeed said danglars   152.93146469276655
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it   90.62974383901707
we parted at hyères   195.4666585432467
serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio who were poisoned   138.83724027277364
teresa had a great desire to see this ball   189.94216682608476
dear valentine   122.87647163198582
monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncle s place and cardinal like mazarin   121.6467248825479
he will arrange everything for me   75.7920579186098
he will not come in time   143.45471358615234
milady seized the occasion   77.53622563392565
what have i then done to you said felton much agitated that you should load me with such a responsibility before god and before men   45.07046900769666
nothing replied bonacieux nothing   106.89430768849004
that would be too terrible   73.99254481403932
beware my lord you are in the hands of god   144.48347129007385
the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair   93.58185423515488
awaken me   134.5233438141961
d artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword   75.7523105663598
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated   206.7113287220631
not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me 4 000 piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than 24 000 livres of our money a sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country   85.70271682296716
said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment   106.14319220358674
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched   128.48257961346596
in one of the mourning coaches beauchamp debray and château renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness   140.7004398969508
father   84.63616693496621
madame de saint méran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former   47.98518614166443
with two companions yes replied the duke   114.00721920900467
as i expected my officer was there   111.86516195484404
and to you a good journey   89.72326469832367
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself   106.82664639325029
but monsieur you know then i know that you have been abducted madame   137.55663851857526
the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game   81.63477004238896
the same   65.75591910085501
monsieur du vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about money   150.1537459227963
who o o pla   138.69378002221558
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him   96.21184761406148
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom   97.00433120341431
but we shall indubitably attract a ball   35.82515205441243
you have done for me as you promised all that you could do   90.13462951476014
desrues was however i must confess more skilful   58.38430061159277
so you see that i am not likely to do any of these things   167.72838466932842
cried anne of austria this is more than i can bear   45.59435372905919
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys   111.27930995850117
good the execution of plots is my forte   95.59598487327358
but he does wrong to use his privilege   88.57960936770857
i thought the abbé busoni had told your excellency   182.64108704403486
never mind in the meantime he marries mercédès the lovely mercédès at least he returns to do that   168.24159506236083
four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out guard   91.26210920283128
the same evening the cardinal spoke to m   178.00948860120369
i give you 45 000 francs that is 2 500 livres of income a fortune such as i wish i had myself and you are not satisfied   202.62407444382475
we are almost there and i want no one to see me getting out of your carriage   33.47595702222418
this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued   142.00356461140876
and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price   97.33409391312095
said dantès and without relinquishing mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air   59.21627371143116
joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought   82.81783336229233
the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it   61.141399602483865
you will learn horsemanship swordsmanship in all its branches and dancing   177.26347895679487
the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franz s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features   74.66187570572599
on the entrance of the new comers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising   111.41096584714457
demanded the king   158.54596029736842
then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife   72.4569087418457
listen morrel it is noon   121.53165359580802
justice will be done said villefort   161.03307912883793
and the spanish woman   44.153864508204876
who told you   121.24572582409576
nor was this all   157.05577419783924
had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst oxford and newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement   124.78724554807003
danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day   113.9480239125691
do you fear he will not understand   159.48685182840322
will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment for of all this i have the proofs   177.21058391225668
they both alighted   105.70898557801324
we are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark   78.84642114195017
i reside in my father s house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building   152.088520892311
nothing would be more easy said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal   137.8426333198236
i have however already told you sir i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter   186.2033523705399
begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight   67.11992915189754
my father s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m   175.8870230242568
i must not therefore tell you   99.00638962945969
in spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible discharge   135.1825402158663
but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot   80.79319040377321
we know that the dream of his life had been to become a musketeer   104.54429615443398
good thought milady   151.12748636247298
at this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching   124.41377534879933
you are about my height pierre said he   154.05291826782616
to the huguenots as places of safety there only remained la rochelle   95.39027060819387
i will send for m   85.73134315889929
was the cry   128.71327092721558
the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape   153.7641315240144
his respiration was broken and short   128.43375275399023
at the second turn a bunch of fresh violets thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins indicated to albert that like himself and his friend the peasants had changed their costume also   83.15177255540084
i no longer begged for liberty but memory   89.55117972581691
monte cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of pindar youth is a flower of which love is the fruit   173.5176237002463
in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me   125.84830242228358
no mademoiselle said monte cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question   156.7410792886885
d artagnan took his hand   54.66740381879391
and what did he do the rest of his time   118.86237199240806
as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had run and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle   64.74747812355312
well and i shall get it   119.699087487171
for unpaid wages   140.2637972643424
the next day in fact at daybreak the court made preparations to quit saint germain   136.38583797673047
i tell you so by the faith of de tréville   146.61332958210056
cried blaisois i wish i had been in his place   178.1614349676945
where is her stepmother   54.73260593754034
i also have had dreams   122.02324608303749
a present from an enemy is not a good thing   70.19179277374158
chapter 31   63.42969152948771
yes doubtless   126.35096508299705
therefore as far as it lies in my power i endeavor to celebrate it by some 20237m heroic action interrupted château renaud   151.28187176255895
la jeune amélie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible   186.06161125653998
sire said lord leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false reports   63.953755913383816
noirtier poison madame de saint méran   169.14995103709236
at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle   139.26397731075187
not under present circumstances monsieur   169.87090341846556
are you going   61.50186842655019
you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first   163.20265580556963
the doctor left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it and going up to noirtier said abruptly how do you find yourself   120.3977207543803
you will ruin both yourself and me by your folly   154.68750295310952
he had despaired of finding bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end   111.65153258326697
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge   101.43674961817644
monsieur jests but monsieur will see   92.61012328852563
while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of a large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the smell   119.8317709846468
alack   151.7420237415535
but what brings you here   111.95467288570943
i leave you therefore as i took you rich but little respected   9.902352180228831
he asked with his flattering manner   100.76924452915308
then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child   131.3826718145454
this is an enigma said athos but it matters not   87.92301954266263

and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant general the count of morcerf peer of france   100.53868548630952
but monte cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes   91.20150997548892
this letter was from my brother   118.68706952053212

in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleon s secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villefort s plot   112.58696073802207

one morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all day leaving the kind hearted assunta who loved him as if he were her own child to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence   151.5992103681595

there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse   91.67810172063596
aramis shuddered   162.65875709116747
so much the better cried porthos   158.73228980421632

you are very humble today remarked the governor   156.40348554128929
oh valentine were i in your place and did i feel conscious as you do of being worshipped adored with such a love as mine a hundred times at least should i have passed my hand between these iron bars and said take this hand dearest maximilian and believe that living or dead i am yours yours only and forever   101.36002014468012
oh he was decidedly   67.10076949211162
and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection m   117.66454889665741
cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her eyes   219.1178421213637
but i do not think he has much claim to that title   86.50216956294095
when the two musketeers had entered   88.76864388484702

the waking chapter 33   159.62099809678426

those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave   116.93759908401891
d artagnan followed him and mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many groans   245.23355654194134
it was just light enough for her to see who was coming   148.91782550642222
cried mercédès with an angry look at her cousin   134.59114540202427
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you   168.5877817160441
nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness   176.78226510827398

let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see l italienne à alger   123.63699355743314
the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio   162.25104062371605

every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl   81.48992339566166
i am not condemning you for this monsieur baptistin   140.41606349368027
i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom   250.2104242920881
but to that i answer that it is impossible   121.19910587870093
you render me still more unhappy hate you blame you you edmond   74.84688401817127
so if i do not send you more it is because i fear you would not accept a larger sum   130.3761634612148
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell   112.82038520308478
barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness   142.77148283038986
and you did cry   91.02042814369885
d artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy   97.04746264524435
the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes   125.372351467116
stake your diamond then   136.5580209153582
and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them   78.6342276148288
he has invited me to dine there   52.8026012736659
are you willing that i should this evening pass with you the time i generally spend with your mistress   154.85976173861064
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced   106.30292653135052
bonacieux we must have them back again   61.4376284258983
i believe i did   50.187823785231956
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse   145.7400982702183

he was no   79.58985081053711
proud toward an old friend   19.866254645484787
certainly we are friends he replied   171.07674018544787
then run to the door and open it yourself   176.6320360392742
and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain   140.15907478199784
gentlemen replied d artagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence   53.908477473012795

presently they heard milady retire to her room   88.21732776437418
charles having proceeded with aramis as with athos embraced them both   127.19524625046023

lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpent like embraces   153.37746380412264
the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank   145.33318703907184
the count watched albert waving his hand to him   152.94715683107623
gondy bowed respectfully   67.38953574116904
i shall not be more than half an hour   126.7952930911421

i have been the cause of all your misfortunes   97.41997969126098
near here replied de comminges smiling   138.88932769340963
it appears that milady and i are anxious about the health of the same person   216.7343159801878
alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me   68.69974013784667
she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down   86.0050458557624
the moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light   73.92478932120898
yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the money   165.49245247611157
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary   111.56024797375058
i was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o clock when i caught sight of your carriage and horses   162.34274155048467
what is he doing up there   65.17218398575059
for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration   142.60229752973962
on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow   136.55850920881554
de villefort entered his father s room followed by madame de villefort   51.55554711343504
then he took the glass emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed valentine had taken it and replaced it on the table   93.33669825682102
there answered the traveler pointing to the table   117.96276116086818
the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques   83.24636251597633
the young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute   124.76363209389115
no unfortunately   63.25459197926404
cromwell s letter   62.21659315282491
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it   155.40873809895635
what then has monsieur de flamarens been telling me   156.92024199551923
this is a detail preserved to us by brienne   8.908041856217054

the baron went out sobbing   99.47427723598314
as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio   118.68044494549527
what undertaking can have brought him to paris   119.40421765937094
he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty   139.68297590635274
exclaimed mordaunt thank you   73.05116995001688
de tréville possessed at the commencement of his   127.11788783627797
and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton and paid his bill to the host he resumed his route with planchet already relieved of one of his led horses   229.05834673753594
but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress   120.88604983696145
bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element   142.92586102448638
on approaching the house he perceived m   122.61714507660928
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere have i not obeyed   170.57718713468978
exclaimed the terrible interrogator   124.2007252865217
a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe   113.99204225480929

bazin who looked at his master without comprehending the cause of this change in a melancholy manner allowed the omelet to slip into the spinach and the spinach onto the floor   121.87318055594841
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction   160.4255292310857
de troisville as his family was still called in gascony or m   110.98926841804041
the king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep   100.61668204446701
so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets   44.47974546328081
if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed a being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain   83.28055024000898
dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass above which gleamed a triangular sail   112.07106509891123

madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her   160.34059915022965
the world calls me beautiful   144.14254426785655

at ten o clock anne of austria had entered the king s room   99.00541869554621
to prison with him   98.06896443843539
d avrigny took the young man s arm and led him out of the room   144.304089537135
and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities   107.86275689074236

de saint méran villefort s father in law   129.98810137090652

oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange the father a bonapartist the son a royalist   76.59332750902416
de tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance   168.2124635262143
milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out   116.83641452096322
a man appeared on the threshold   139.03860308191136
what will you do with the letter then   61.74538434286135
that evening d artagnan went to present his respects to m   151.18075965686222
if you had been a man you would not have let him go from here   92.13656564106678
after a short time the count saw bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room   107.5608257459956

d artagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished   68.81731445167293

d artagnan the younger notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm as a future musketeer ought nature prevailed and he shed many tears of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half   85.69142908412513
when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist   77.13882383969957

he said you   106.85725339746553

bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment   96.98927366926691
you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss   165.57641114566596

my dear albert said franz leave all to our host   123.49235527111259
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man s road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st   137.83325689466184
we will see about that presently said d artagnan with a slight smile   60.28040426990165
you are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter   99.41543364681593
aramis went so close to chatillon as almost to touch him   110.1974528486472
so my lord deign to receive my most respectful homage   138.36727788592376
i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse   142.76800391435347
about this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of   116.77504979037926
the bargain was concluded   83.18702473380344
and so you see lest he might do you an injury well   110.42156120514328
but i have a partner and you know the italian proverb chi ha compagno ha padrone he who has a partner has a master   96.32764138762394

athos was not altogether the queen s dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again   186.4645400577904
was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence   144.75158022539017
but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them   217.64788170900835

said she and why do you place your hand on me   177.73314806289756
30069m well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on   196.65680416727008
go on monsieur   91.63310228002469
it was himself who was apparently beloved   107.55793454169056
the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme   125.61140067687175

i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the château d if   55.27472577403956
and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass   135.45048146112723
on reaching the door he bowed   175.13710678585102
at auteuil   136.63382516024313
but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france replied the queen   120.19612033689356
i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for i was ashamed   127.7356058238092
he esteems me highly   193.57358676292284
his gravity made him look older than he was   68.70994994231708
villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you   160.49524196059653
monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man   97.74257531194331
let us give the money to the lackeys not to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the englishmen   151.30703439700346

this advice appeared good to the future chancellor   161.24358556356464
my senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities   65.64818106768602
the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture   106.88230239001581

and if i have any counsel to give it is always lose   173.41449797033982
certainly women alone know how to dissimulate said monte cristo to himself glancing at madame danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife   173.53050961046642
but for god s sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair   197.2477512448775
take in two reefs in the top sails cried the captain   109.77619647210824
with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servant s offices   165.45170270125595
it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor   111.13413164703256
they were innumerable   133.05847901202438
said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses   177.93997794759676
kitchens   107.76352155186626
he remained there all night not knowing where he was   201.97883420028796
he left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocketbook   48.208063091767926
then who reigns in france at this moment napoleon ii   157.35454138143797
i shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and i shall make for the dunes as soon as possible   169.4863231177744
i wished to make an effort   134.04555269463194
an old gentleman continued the concierge a staunch follower of the bourbons   147.36194900562137
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon   128.09097465490902
that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you   45.88730679774224
gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall   203.20390751299362
but no one thought of monte cristo   109.8922525673023
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him   135.02687729697433
and danglars wrote the address as he spoke   85.55807552781303
but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so   130.8581890446348
make free now you have begun   114.0124605252854
how have i deviated from those principles monsieur   50.75228424060204
said d artagnan coming back to recommend courage to his lackey   136.6051732353555
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english nation   68.7613492795852
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg   19.330392529792007
that nobleman was you   113.72181178640574
you are going to make a patriarch of him   146.9033573312473
with the first light dantès resumed his search   97.45396955931074
but pshaw   58.27493785763137
the cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of anne   185.7366516385481
at length villefort the most composed of all spoke sir said he to maximilian you say you loved valentine that you were betrothed to her   104.29804810724826
the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency   155.7658885349345
he was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude   149.2987301041799
albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach   86.48790220544304
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape   32.60393262625411
but you receive him at your house   46.03290042884463
now i have thee thou art a frondeur and the lover of madame de longueville   109.18756600075149
not only on account of my own interest but for your safety   177.55020855752932
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly looking   182.02358142989453
i am lost murmured she   110.90756620035239
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience   164.1603239116951
amid all this d artagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos   128.9629388108007
but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other s arms   159.36276015214162
i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance   109.6760392898475
well but put on this dressing gown first said the musketeer to his friend   65.07197630962393
continued gondy turning to the curate of st   36.80381742607753
yes continued caderousse so it is   88.82121972353042
his mother the councillor s old servant opened it   144.1096305749341
my military weapons   114.16010128860457
the idiot   64.98855190392362
be happy and tomorrow we shall have more   72.20369403779739
we have that sir replied bernouin   88.1829197775109
but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man   125.77141066632764
you are mistaken i am not the count of monte cristo   133.07919003109697
yes yes i   59.00930035405588
and during its progress the count of morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of madame danglars   39.354920766179134
cardinal   173.67459731587843
this unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in paris on the tenth of january and the prince of conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of paris   47.85001690247417
you may   131.11733488685806
ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor   86.54115279516309
de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs   168.5713486469601
but you speak of him not of his party his resources   130.48205455656253
twelve hours sir   82.13728604649518
when we are alarmed we see double   160.16443361562307
said the young man in an almost joyful accent pressing monte cristo s hand with both his own   141.42212679500963
he squeezed jacopo s hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remain and remain alone   124.74653077691349
i have reflected and i can not must not be guilty of such a sin   138.55338041417258
i shall die of hunger as old dantès did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth   77.22198497070013
there were sicily pine apples pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis   122.33972356087156
once out of auteuil andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity   61.23807173288414
listen to me mother and do not yield too much to agitation   95.53117021758558
no on my honor said maximilian   157.24811252301072
it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation   86.67472702401587
pray go valentine said   107.04558751415685
just remember what they said   56.6960643917595
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile   148.92821812206637
said athos how much time we have lost   108.26638151709615
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river   107.31383770686739
what say you to that crime of which i have the proof   128.29639211095594
well monsieur said he you appear to be more stupid than i am for you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two   108.49555491913972
she never goes to bed before midnight   123.06385583578474
so much the better said porthos   113.23115498120784
but a confession made to the judges a confession made at the last moment extorted when the crime can not be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty   89.78730137018222
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all   135.87740532310238
release broussel   99.03398342535469
what can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world   70.4289544159407
precisely so cried monte cristo precisely so   124.55153092311811
poor d artagnan said athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he loves   130.76188690705334
oh if you know him tell me   104.76014381281107
the cardinal s enemy   87.59236396523951
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other   44.21101842504993
but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon   139.5498788958145
ask them to sing one more song   93.60074165012558
so that you will remit to me these 48 000 francs   83.9399859843861
he s the second to day   202.61058689974578
he has just written to me   155.6154035040732
i no longer belonged to myself for i had my sister in law to protect and provide for   55.33858696169022
they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass   139.0154437120446
the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which   67.47810218607971
but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past instead of claiming the entrée by the back stairs he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber   189.7637812533677
neither had his eyes bandaged   116.23562506627158
the repast had been ordered by athos and the lackey furnished by porthos   107.77551669163877
a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed   191.9112055249791
bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice his excellency s horses   138.04870838867194
he then seemed more easy   98.15824162032531
my dear mother said he do you know if m   102.99823981515705
come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled monsieur de guebriant and monsieur de gassion   130.54555398483274
valentine was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house and they flew into the passage crying for help   122.67487641215533
our magnificence makes you smile count said maximilian who had followed him with his eyes   167.4016130704427
his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude   78.41512616079842
his eminence was uneasy and sent me to find you   108.94194313839581
it was an oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare   171.63623513685826
i am to wait   94.31052769944559
then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained   193.84546840841813
one who will be your best friend dantès for he is my friend my cousin my brother   100.69441089915613
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already three quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest   47.19665658004293
the hand of the lord is stretched over him said felton   82.09658185628992
then i understand it all   49.34848649849843
perhaps you are right said morcerf   95.58627312521968
because monsieur replied kitty my mistress loves you not at all   137.56673410558295
bills upon spain   86.42137299420841
and you found it   124.23951166804213
asked the governor   153.00389223035262
has morrel whom we know been killed   115.36601821396617
madame danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention   118.0854409025241
and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so   151.71168053214438
you are laughing at me   57.71411376174867
oh do not fear   97.55856275644052
does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory   118.3429773014507
but blaisois ventured to say i have heard you relate monsieur mousqueton that once on a time at chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose   96.15280989839333
he took the child in his arms embraced him shook him called him but the child made no response   117.34656153321758
yes madame in your oratory   161.3781205827415
it cost me more but i have nothing to fear   81.85330491297171
your father major bartolomeo cavalcanti   102.21064751725999
this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy   101.51149893522295
patrick remain here or rather join the king wherever he may be and tell his majesty that i humbly beg him to excuse me but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to london   119.69366844823054
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal   93.49375405383
cried the astonished woman   178.4781705283267
oh i can not go without taking leave of her   60.45504481721746
good my friend good   85.77405736618414
prince cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities   129.31923609884618
her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination   73.85229329409589
make preparations for departure   108.21118643947219
come have you committed some crime pursued by human justice from which i can protect you   88.97408927769642
cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face   133.8014931206406
d artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had formed   159.34309554589152
then he paused   86.6887076167254
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night   78.60456327096045
how do you know   38.86473924140691
and bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket   104.34841727534271
the comte de la fere madame replied the young man bowing   52.87660640813775
the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with d artagnan   110.96772389251747
of course we do replied albert   128.6881933805761
it is not he who plays   66.63540759863277
but your eminence   66.43508980502442
the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant you will follow these men and not lose sight of them   76.7017171337937
the woman screamed and cried for help   189.22044032141034
no but perhaps you will permit me to call to mind stay   105.2682166992728
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him   135.24547884286596
it was said that madame de longueville for whom the prince had more than a brother s affection and in whom he had confided had been indiscreet   104.39842869308877
no one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said ali bring me my pistols with the ivory cross   42.38116383202798
but they are calling me   124.2670818239412
does your honor want a horse   129.68924377292007
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen   96.04794608335561
that of a lieutenant of musketeers   43.5201669579604
and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency   172.43868942116922
that is all i promise you   69.55976080914203
it is buried in the cellars of newcastle keep   99.09328823084864
gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired   149.43167964590657
planchet whom he had sent home two hours before from the hôtel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him   77.61286553585853
villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his nails   87.82322366321702
be satisfied beautiful constance   159.35126270904757
then arousing from his reverie now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you   63.99216795209069
it would be exceedingly droll   36.29243032121197
it is a demand that porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds   112.70688739313576
the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood in   109.54391582249012
then in a last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the floor   173.54299021300665
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice s steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins   90.16663544445508
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes   129.09903711142468
and now tis your turn said the coadjutor turning to the last that remained   86.57544505833012
the enemy   134.51259754129876
their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed   121.86096981284446
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m   124.76349520039578
athos walked about in a contemplative mood   98.03160692954478
how far distant   94.46360383460976
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for d artagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin   190.76499298031902
drunk if you like   132.9720607459265
this milady this woman this creature this demon has a brother in law as i think you told me d artagnan   99.41093940653121
cavalcanti will certainly fight   142.85735148752985
you are naked   125.95587535519469
oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable   2.299073609950625
yes your excellency said the captain we have reached it   114.76036924142626
said the cardinal and for what purpose   96.09598750404459
yes count and a splendid duel too   142.92951304271682
said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right   105.51453322467171
by the scorn i will throw upon her   164.7907961023754
i hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men   61.56323587030341
the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean see plutarch s life of scipio africanus   103.2950608858892
i will give you the baton of the marechal de la meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now   123.65620448429178
no was there one   137.31624014021588
observed one of the bearers   150.44734738977846
you are in the wrong to tell me that my lord   167.49879764660415
but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable   48.02236964974922
cried barrois who felt another fit coming   117.83539008634142
if i could but do as you do and eat pates and drink burgundy at the house of father marteau s successor   123.14081312398302
god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear   145.01840505525743
something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne   121.00762428175494
you must not stop an instant on the way   113.35066537494185
the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him   160.01452743967923
said d artagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave paris   16.472872988985728
tomorrow then   5.8433790291256145
my dear fellow i think we should ask you that question   124.17157859559894
and as the king began to lose what he had won he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing charlemagne if we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance   157.37366074270062
i have been waiting for someone who has not come   131.93999520017024
no no continued d artagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman   138.68061157795444
oil is a sovereign balm for wounds   126.88649174745838
thus sure that the rider would not release his hold raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words   192.2539775304848
her eyes were cast down and she was crying   117.16803481308837
nevertheless let not your majesty be uneasy we will find means   185.995143314646
not at all i assure you   200.87469259247868
shall you have the courage   116.14364699487008
he formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future   148.47586735490597
it was the first time franz had ever seen a guillotine we say guillotine because the roman mandaïa is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument   149.68540454855378
i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation   104.78247242538319
answered caderousse you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner   119.41487785593596
but sit down said monte cristo   118.63112291914503
upon grimaud   130.0618679194335
he started   159.66401139385496
do not fear i have little to prepare   70.45378256996217
anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur   172.3459764318205
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth   165.8811642978008
morrel looked at her with astonishment   174.11305968890207
you do   60.38980672751687
she corrupted this man   63.30436970805784
you have hastened to me can i have the happiness of being useful to you   94.72565059232004
the countess took albert to meet madame danglars   220.0530388425914
hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you   87.11956184734919
he was then as punctual as the samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say   150.8845833439297
he was there   161.28784010593594
oh you can not believe what you say   133.92777665708502
very well my lord   113.72665588704828
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for d artagnan   30.066144195090132
at last they reached the tennis court   135.3005169753985
said the young captain shaking his head   77.41948768380594
how i have suffered   79.39524643338528
said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no friend in the world but you   55.77258364325205
it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated   94.86260744677486
and you still bid me hope   99.02594246184074
rest assured gentlemen that within three days in a less time than justice would demand the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble   118.9571830978782
do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count   90.47683471044391
and it was time for you were sinking   178.97068674027315
you are right cried the gentleman   57.70732178002919
no replied athos fortunately monsieur d artagnan has only fainted   145.63592710130166
and the two separated saying till this evening   119.90767820603347
the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a first rate sailor she yet was tolerably obedient   122.08815832552463
cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said morrel   95.13511742861667
they had seen no one   236.74936997019194
no you shall live honored and pure   59.11991849494304
that gentleman i say what has become of him   12.434347382191902
yes monseigneur replied the young man   74.92143721100314
morrel and i adore mercédès   63.37353297137451
and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable   159.71993525691258
i comprehend   146.84789817309564
oh exclaimed morrel why do they not come   145.27389685659963
indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or mad   206.45545183270724
i will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better humor   58.73467039185052
exclaimed signor pastrini utterly impossible   138.63391597518807
nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold   152.55684602321537
i shall know about that soon for i shall soon speak out to athos   146.45742558519575
too ardently perhaps   151.96875318277768
that was most probable   75.86424055196039
the question is this monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and didactic   150.44154627350508
well said villefort what then   153.57085878870214
shall i receive it from my father   137.45469912733105
in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself   105.72458780059182
said she simpering   142.82238232548767
we have i think a private room in the piazza del popolo   66.77112191191875
then sitting down by the fire my supper said he   84.65136938875057
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird   97.11068175378276
do what monsieur de la fere requests   94.4251072039041
who am i   115.72699221526415
this brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale topaz   168.8480227023976
i will keep it returned morcerf   41.77738742180607
but it was plain that all assistance was useless all the features of the dying man were distorted with agony   64.32493254487181
i recommend the cardinal to your attention   44.663587026528276
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought   50.10169850840903
louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmanteau   104.04948133759935
what do you ask of me   136.37134129261753
listen when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive   205.43539461186197
and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the soldiers   104.86475028461803
he was in the country as i was told by the person who recommended him to me   79.13045169208198
the king called the cardinal   85.7357222441061
albert that and he may know what to answer you   9.642145914218204
my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you   151.4794606438503
still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer   181.82521213579577
cried d artagnan tell us all about it   94.5678070942901
mistrust yourself john said he   98.92178188399308
what ails you baron   112.7383415052162
do you not think so   95.76669828748909
de la trémouille s testimony and himself   65.01283384407138
frightful   75.48026654613297
sir you know well i would risk my life for you   81.8235253455989
i am all attention said the abbé   180.15156677819994
mine are numerous   134.2786349952894
at half past seven the retreat was sounded   91.89745867767097
she revives   95.48851208410298
and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes   163.42770011858974
yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him   78.57798885744397
and the duke swooned   111.55606983568684
you see then d artagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is   164.31113789379538
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones   120.02764637850824
the expression was imprudent   73.3316335178609
oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself   77.86480060047859
very sorry monsieur   145.7572286510825
it anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events   152.4818972638279
only i concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when i remained forty eight hours without eating or drinking   127.80675165485471
where do your excellencies wish to go   157.5423992684498
my dear friend said caderousse eat of my bread and take my advice   100.23639348062576
and i also am to fight with this gentleman said aramis coming in his turn onto the place   165.59884605389752
villefort cast a gloomy look around him   115.83640138636645
i do not say replied andrea that you never make a good one   121.2647089163962
cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere   15.027992341811256
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurator s wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears   80.66758172403004
mademoiselle said franz turning towards valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age   136.78368949931183
the young man burst into a laugh   192.90079805899177
at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously   207.99640908056648
a loan nothing more   11.789973089706805
said louise   130.78597651060113
her head hung back and her long hair swept the ground   120.52479788641858
no sentinels no one at any of the windows   180.7382080600765
the prince smiled   165.29101203332166
let me look for this letter   81.54402347141249
well now what are your conditions if i employ you   222.3425639010334
oh pardon me sir   64.50407240729604
the first feeling that pervaded paris on hearing of the flight to saint germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone   104.42426484347929
i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness   90.22248896084109
no i grieve not on my own account i shall always find a resource   95.92268657448817
if replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her   73.96440470748229
i will be responsible for the barony   135.12042753540183
the porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch   201.87553521801945
have you no friends in paris then monsieur porthos   175.63831979064088
the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel   73.35208500472024
ah beauchamp i see you know something already   80.01749181238097
the man of meung the crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged   161.0243250875594
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance   60.811895994626596
and he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle   68.90317915033413
but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date 30th july 1816 and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again   60.141573377713414
with whom   70.0631299378416
he shouted again   92.84609260829916
ah mercy mercy   107.61811466080925
the finger of god once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry   125.83201267251506
cavalcanti had done half an hour before   142.4108634932229
the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell   183.1986840605776
is he tall or short   82.333750135685
neither in the antechamber nor in the corridor nor beneath the great door   158.9637654452081
at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that hope fernand replied mercédès   158.69077790240135
you think so porthos   80.23834203335909
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery   75.24959920071574
if i die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to you   88.60687506813584
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits   109.25294048891575
you shall go to vincennes where monsieur de beaufort is confined   141.94262979601294
au revoir monsieur bonacieux au revoir   159.8684374402785
ah really said monte cristo in a half stifled voice   182.03845498351887
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as d artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step   102.13672144706075
but i am firm   140.1158836397011
but as planchet awoke in an instant and cried who goes there   75.51995622754391
and writes me thence   75.57829720843671
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts   110.57521425810273
no said monte cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious it is in the country   155.27672514576557
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune   39.79706729412737
have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune   193.58171881199817
i like that best replied lord de winter laughing   66.47283681077609
no truly you comfort me   123.38821171910016
did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty   69.51085821360975
i did go to monsieur d artagnan s   168.53353505800058
possessed by one single thought that of the promise he had made and of the responsibility he had taken he retired last to his chamber begged the host to procure him a map of the province bent over it examined every line traced upon it perceived that there were four different roads from béthune to armentières and summoned the lackeys   93.06024143985053
i have had some   68.24267490522243
d avrigny returned about eight o clock in the morning   134.99855596337693
said aramis how did you manage it   65.94161531574396
noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe   73.10581933937831
and he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered much   65.60530735378387
in a moment   55.39340114775543
then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit   119.50933385756677
but in face of the proof i was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the recital   181.1211357289057
she undertook his seduction and succeeded   114.93313802518306
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river   152.3186891022203
facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexceptionable   144.51749950115683
a week before his return lord de winter died leaving me his sole heir   69.59818981340234
12 jacques louis david a famous french painter 1748 1825   159.8614251404846
no doubt of it   69.99414012857314
he saw a little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in everything except drawing a sword and firing a pistol with something haughty and contemptuous in his face   66.01447084840837
the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean   120.31642619087206
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no suspicion of it   167.3659321559727
a burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon   174.60591470479253
i must know so that i may assist you if there is any chance   70.39285826182986
the young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase   175.47377726828964
do you not see your friends or are you too proud to speak to them   81.79936396146495
d artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting   131.80755057526952
i will give you three replied the stranger   18.893868052913064
there it is cried the jesuit   102.18525378706043
a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbé s speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards   103.24738322749197
his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern   152.58628409340358
we let them tell their story out replied mousqueton   119.467091863899
bonacieux inferred from this ah that the affair grew more and more intricate   169.02110963292117
if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all i wish   119.51222023818988
but do not be too confident   137.11829840943022
valentine durst not oppose her grandmother s wish the cause of which she did not know and an instant afterwards villefort entered   111.08975855012031
he told me let me think what was it   120.94689568606853
the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executioner   135.28879786600356
cried the steward here   189.38038419775376
you say you desire my mother s good opinion   110.21572897070035
i had at the moment of being ordained a little difficulty with but that would not interest you and i am taking up your valuable time   155.28150176433746
what happened then   84.20117119282062
but and i say it with some pride mercédès god needed me and i lived   97.7101209181037
they are the count of château renaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the round table   134.96251124171368
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saint remy   112.4777341833791
you were looking the other way   61.11179447358974
lord who can say monsieur   157.5465515298152
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain   110.1279074072531
as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms   100.63486547550674
but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to m   170.50146580487748
it is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine   132.1521508422284
a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity   94.63842581383656
one does the work while the other stands guard   138.55686325751748
said faria when the young man had finished reading it   100.75919268265261
he promised   141.065361048495
she is in the prison of nantes   187.56160543126293
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs   176.29014555026086
well i will give it up then said the young woman sighing   82.70169829463283
remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman   106.32969557232556
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau   87.72828351692044
now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground   79.99337189179934
and he thus gained the name of the stoic   125.38764726928736
but tell me well what do you wish to know   120.2131330004694
do you dance count   52.422954885390325
it is a color very well known in botany but till the present time very rare among horses   138.52025976708265
and where are these four men   87.61293898685133
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm   60.06545571791485
we will   150.90696828050767
as i went away a purse fell at my feet it contained five and twenty louis   129.0280967612355
in reality observed albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric   157.21744169898932
you are a delightful cicerone   142.73501816571343
he smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the gascon anxious   97.96128736673764
do you think anything else was to be expected of them   211.4640836244521
in the first place i was four years making the tools i possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself   99.25628148144119
possibly after all   48.80014264652243
the pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult   87.09405478846543
you see it is a serious annoyance said morcerf when beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph   19.826336563931633
but he was soon aroused from these reflections by lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might   67.42342893838449
we must go and find lord winter   84.71904415435978
happily there is nothing of the kind and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it   63.51717612214802
porthos my friend you know i am descended on the father s side from the prophets and on the mother s from the sybils and that i only speak in parables and riddles   154.4132135563436
i think he is violently agitated   49.57477108079567
this is fine   129.1419813533375
i fear the cardinal   168.8359453960285
go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right   82.07783566889921
madame said villefort i ask where is m   91.76086373986043
lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient   135.76615700937384
but pass the pen over to monsieur abbé   126.45621620055286
d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise which was not quite free from joy   144.31970597173998
the notary showed me the documents yesterday which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately   41.79340082810393
but you are only two   242.52519106957325
they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly room   124.87754462956745
although about forty four or forty five years old she might have passed for thirty five   154.52673032168823
very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman   59.39447997169022
no less said athos as pale as a corpse   97.80832529800557
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed   76.26806996647991
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you   144.04947294554592
there is no one but myself can so execute them that one can not tell the new from the old   46.3594008311005
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle d armilly s fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantio s malediction on desdemona   89.04455112629807
i adopt all customs speak all languages   135.3015607277041
what a beautiful creature   103.21999907791077
at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity   116.22780496858793
if there are three let yourself be slain but save the king   149.89648914328384
allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside   77.25308514825991
i am of monsieur de bassompierre s party   73.83059112571561
are people to be run against without warning   189.89529704459213
you never come to me without conferring pleasure   154.7887111692702
a count and a rich one too eh   113.90687013423673
were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million   102.59487546737279
suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion   191.6896913007163
morrel said dantès observing the owner s impatience here is your supercargo m   86.90201826030818
the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him   164.76902299242698
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes   135.52156812876402
what is the matter with you my friend   142.4973834991997
you were not certain my child was dead and you buried it   100.0623455371337
i have placed reliance upon you my friend   185.72990438213316
you my dear chevalier d herblay he said are the fronde incarnate   117.0499002979525
at last he sank   140.8340441565576
you met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house   95.34649876738419
yes but you have not this little staircase said monte cristo opening a door concealed by the drapery   81.10798810683565
glad   144.55507898377752
that by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to parliament   137.37342902724401
at the fifth stroke the door opened and lord wilmore appeared   117.56801097393804
buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened   109.29159845604605
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned   156.20443763993387
ah yes he said as if awaking from a dream   123.35419199950744
and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it   22.43011286776813
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way   90.26853064859327
grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy   187.75215050824508
chapter 24   193.00350224276707
now what are we to do with you   81.08933623643028
come now he said   19.852270285607673
in short said d artagnan this has been the will of god   156.62301976051364
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his horse   148.76470911461007
it is yours   95.34206255089939
look well at his right hand on which he has a large wound   178.08366947130273
and you replied to him with that notion   73.93539316934542
that voice that voice   103.6682099455025
if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping   152.89740704801557
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder   28.553840758628468
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the king s procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m   160.4871260370157
that of aramis uneasiness   90.29639691568056
and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier   154.62015693034724
they belong to the regiment that was at lens which the prince assigned to the cardinal   116.08150018635378
such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of cardinal mazarin once that of cardinal richelieu   168.08318485062847
there disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneys general and bailiffs   174.44578052870094
that the place royale is the termination to the main road to vendomois and nothing else   137.8529367916499
shall we not set forth   118.8244728984343
now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage   101.49543853360301
draw up this note for us aramis   70.61905948313516
now he is turning   75.14721604770703
exclaimed the king to fight   125.57156196507995
and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads   92.88604705257141
his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth   191.47871277544456
what number was it that rang   118.66123852974098
and when she finally returned did she bring that casket with her   56.26243720226422
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat   114.54148385726792
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known   132.55602053332876
yes that may be   183.00473149495593
monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder   212.84495045782688
at least a year   115.64027946095301
his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the fight   140.55233414888718
willingly answered the duke give me the pie   74.86013232967358
they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did   174.78752439485476
it is the face of the count of monte cristo   78.27170184445563
nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins   78.0414293675231
they have left me my purse and pocket book   147.98468437907468
0215m you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place   193.12994277920484
these arrangements made the lackeys retired   103.58749401257919
he owed me for the councillor the pettifogger   115.70540567764796
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondy s coachman   105.89555007796547
replied villefort   175.5882129849847
a large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead   152.47260538700027
but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale   51.70106962721307
i was worn out with fatigue   103.08166512082522
murmured athos thinking of d artagnan and porthos   73.31996411005512
it is too late they are coming said eugénie   184.54659110414119
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes   95.91095233328943
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private   166.1007900213067
at last d avrigny slowly uttered these words she is still alive   82.05933463612206
here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop   26.522355498986343
ck from the small   18.11311783430122
you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth   227.2146582799642
this hurt is just the fellow of the one i had on the road to amiens   75.90687286589385
what could they desire beyond their liberty   157.63858681353875
i re enter it   32.159868179233044
haul taut   133.83148382559207
and d artagnan set the example   75.25402561380614
cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said aramis so we give it up   141.36852056710052
the abbé busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone   92.13268027217178
you must know all your officers i mean those more distinguished   8.303321388711922
to day this morning   106.71460922991314
well listen my dear aramis said d artagnan   157.2500804944161
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself   57.66498244155154
what a singular being you are   189.02117064508315
in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of france   129.47890822433973
and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul   145.9452453890027
by my honor these gascons are incorrigible   70.41999313252899
he was we repeat handsome young and bold   133.68430446687313
if he lays his hand on the boat s edge i will cut it off regicide that he is   33.7847930193244
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse   117.21053774952485
but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer s house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac   143.63230302052892
planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont regiment   121.88639609752117
de tréville being paid the pensive d artagnan took the longest way homeward   95.53386078638133
said the countess without replying to the question   122.87636063781953
morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown danger   100.70436007046239
but you ll die of hunger said the patron   155.8394436523422
picture to yourself a pretty coach house at the right hand side where the ladders are kept   153.87406655680266
i will not make you a slave to your filial piety   155.7574367164759
i asked you if you knew him   104.84167800365792
well then listen valentine said the count   134.5363426406394
probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend   111.26622499466184
just as they were sitting down to table m   97.01300734548963
what you say is absurd and i can not see why m   98.10717083800651
too much reality would always remain in my recollection   171.6812879043358
never mind replied villefort   62.82399250876706
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis   169.37041270592422
he will come and visit the comte de la fere   209.68259410885076
but how comes the diamond in your possession sir   19.720852253047127
he commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot   125.5296581281425
albert bowed to madame danglars and advanced towards madame de villefort whose lips opened as he approached   117.22239776573906
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you   111.47940115494765
follow me monsieur said mazarin   112.52759539263681
demanded d artagnan in his turn   201.8964347429004
saint denis   143.47300054843583
albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes   113.40852730996991
what do i think captain   184.36348611269284
but be easy no blood will flow   115.35984789238286
where can you find them then   147.925967071568
it signifies little said mazarin when he was alone   133.98896930896947
the only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once   178.55810918452454
it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat   9.3506611275359
i thought i saw said one of the servants horsemen dressed in yellow creeping along the bed of the stream   147.48996837626567
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and d artagnan remained master of the field of battle   201.9175982380766
de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter   129.11213517554725
monte cristo had already seen the breakfast room and the salon on the ground floor   82.39315524728912
ah i recollect you asked for a place at my window   165.64512398330456
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead   153.94569615466716
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60 000 francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500 000 or 600 000 livres   117.73449947955983
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves   109.92083851350391
and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef   66.60325447222581
was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery   82.97222918078978
he examined him and found him sound and without blemish   100.84631571989652
oh do not do that excellency   148.13229259366705
morrel said he again turning his quid as for that as for what   62.34724177497708
a square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle occupied the center of the room   107.36320875760579
interrupted buckingham   135.19065999741343
yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another   89.9812400333671
morrel looked around uneasily   163.61761094538966
i know no better means than to act with candor   148.5472826722734
de saint méran whose sole heiress i am   96.56224151627504
command me sir what am i to do   107.58655002147025
knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was characteristic   77.46949756413979
d artagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of porthos two feet at the most   150.72065334384533
if i am to remain here permanently as monsieur mazarin has kindly given me to understand i must provide myself with a diversion for my old age i must turn gourmand   82.74214672211308
for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred   210.566856673638
yes i have seen aramis   46.8777155445279
good lord how quickly men forget   31.329374301943616
athos always carried the key of this coffer about him   45.275801591212655
and what did the letter contain   32.67731545572677
these 3 000 francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future   134.06431818982352
i beg of your majesty then said athos calmly and not replying to mazarin to quash these arrests of messieurs d artagnan and du vallon   112.85880928707927
i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other   162.01437230941718
oh i remember   105.62930288936924
i might as well say count benedetto   108.86447666666541
i had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when i met friend danglars   130.20268122464813
if you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing   119.91235343641677
he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket   95.3624729765618
will not escape him   100.79131511512632
and a large sum   145.19415063923668
asked the king eagerly   155.35983523927985
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect your very humble and obedient servant godeau purveyor of the musketeers that s all well   15.404275072227449
then i may tell you all   178.58543970406174
dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons i have named to you or heard mention of anyone of them   98.97733928336906
i am the only man in the world having the right to say to you morrel your father s son shall not die today   98.1494932438218
bonacieux what is that noise   84.32864796069052
my dear d artagnan said he if you please we will join our friends   189.73518932107237
not the same thing by any means   66.34899822688533
and he rapped his pocket book in which he had just placed a letter   111.64262296014694
then athos looking into his friend s face and taking him by both hands said what ails you my lord   110.49341478461432
but said andrea why do you not act on the advice you gave me   72.4197031543477
name it sir i beg   136.35778011059253
and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are   84.16740524813548
still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason   149.54347764244883
you have spared me yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance i was the most guilty   66.34221091977703
you have your servant s clothes on you therefore keep a servant   176.2771445545285
i prefer listening to you here my dear m   41.26915977299407
no nothing at all   170.6470687186055
three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants   115.08871099260695
but this was not what louis xiii   3.440468974640865
not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it   155.99580179023678
he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed   110.80430589917479
still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot   97.91433679807571
it is well madame said mazarin   151.27468206831063
you would not fight a duel   66.0026407781474
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed   141.67160493030278
he grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treachery   168.361111954509
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible   26.42616042904865
well said he friend what matters the regiment of guards to us and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance   165.36864095751258
said athos exchanging a smile with d artagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad   85.26474374737813
he received yesterday a message from the prince de condé   74.86276057869588
in one hour after the ordinance was published in london that no vessel bound for france should leave port not even the packet boat with letters   119.95322547151065
and milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second   157.06726897474806
that is true said the king   61.650858421169225
i salute you marie michon to this letter was added an order conceived in these terms at the louvre august 10 1628 the superior of the convent of béthune will place in the hands of the person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage   83.42952173421756
and the fact is i have gained 16 000 francs by the sale of them   66.51353170565088
marechal de grammont   152.70835590393767
at least i hope not   75.92760257061815
what do you think of the story chalais s esquire relates   124.27637900570208
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on   93.15100787713862
andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began   166.1027937229506
one however fell at the duke s feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket   141.42501950251577
but reflect they will keep us here till daybreak   142.9294262486748
i have this said he   124.08349499120915
shall i take out any more of them   82.19091911360462
ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo   76.38531577079574
and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will speak   195.40112936052395
said he read   67.80111047552155
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his weapon   71.92567372758347
i fancy i have heard so   150.87840391868002
place yourself close to the coach door on the right   101.97438141762301
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they can not or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks   106.52501027928275
for himself he had no doubt she was a victim of the cardinal s vengeance   67.0451769671125
my god yes gave that is the word said porthos   137.40018618273945
he will be one sooner or later   104.07396960294884
we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel son of marseilles   113.32230654268518
but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him   76.24065085590524
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre   91.25261444836588
milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her to lie down on the bed   96.19493545999228
cried morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards valentine   120.8226136857187
and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime i believe i do society a kindness   111.6189175920768
he understood the old man s meaning   127.80246952926612
sire murmured lord leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity   74.08654114777823
0175m but said the abbé i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions   93.07197634011473
i shall be most grateful monsieur if you will at some future time renew your offer but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and i will therefore wait   179.96914018028355
milady looked at this man and hesitated   181.85251273260158
something more terrible more fatal more alarming for us the child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it   87.56925355510015
i have this one safe   145.20999542185916
then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the valley   106.73523020409311
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate   141.60209547211562
you may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the chevalier d humieres has promised me whenever i need them   107.08268528095682
why the devil   155.55163259252078
all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones   28.684454215667785
germain a glass of sherry and a biscuit   104.94072725139063
she repeated   130.46266589533212
come fernand won t you return to marseilles with us   150.3515179178218
there was no longer any doubt the treasure was there no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket   115.4047268863722
his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a three cornered hat   175.6437768755072
oh said andrea my father s old servant   51.195642144664646
therefore i shall not get into a passion with them   176.0323678780063
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret   68.08502189867127
milady remained silent   224.45428086714563
andrea took five and twenty louis from his pocket   64.35754242209606
athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said i know it grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn me of his presence   77.95313376050782
the friends obeyed   194.07309599132287
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room   56.01099930388911
take some then and come back immediately   167.62152382431483
stop cried athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted   66.74716936030029
but felton that s another thing   109.53890238236714
and now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred   121.87267383121713
gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the illustrious coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world   192.38315755510467
he approached the doctor and seizing his arm valentine said he it is valentine s turn   120.51795388242347
albert came up to them at this moment with franz   87.94380874666297
artless as she was the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave and besides madame de villefort came to her assistance   44.5246046646884
murmured raoul   143.42178033810944
all the world is wicked   143.7635276875697
in which we hear tidings of aramis   45.81570238861586
groslow   159.58870325510702
i recognized you some time since as the insolent dandy who so gracefully mounted his horse in the champs élysées   105.45194310512937
and that ghost told me morrel that i had lived long enough   123.49279868066851
name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must bring   111.59899298235781
mousqueton smiled disdainfully   65.9682985413956
are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo   102.45152986648192
mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to d artagnan   127.12983282960572
immediately   113.41910833036975
but pardon said d artagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man s shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing   68.71898851041226
another flash illuminated all around them   92.68253844335814
but without words protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours   99.47955914433625
the white flag morbleu   131.65794062165432
a physician was sought for but none was yet found   151.70538028144506
but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before   121.1894053163548
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back   144.92443754884485
i must learn where we are going   76.52486680223224
asked danglars carelessly   93.96792929338994
what is her brother in law s name   52.330099135981634
if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them raoul   108.86644148362736
0087m do you indeed think so   110.52380631951235
i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived   65.60269715589574
albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to know how she had become the slave of the count   138.01747343069502
oh god be praised he said   165.58688598303522
your grandmamma has just arrived valentine said m   71.89855515296496
your daughter will be married tomorrow if not today in a week if not tomorrow   128.1871114068208
the man in the mask   84.93257057172269
is not that the duc de chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers   137.77755508465205
anxiously inquired albert   137.31489373664513
what say you franz   123.25184589234738
but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have none   127.20416484000896
but the king is asleep   63.884316351362244
the prince is with them ah   157.20112616696827
meanwhile emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us   47.8838335102469
0165m mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast   130.39291858012967
oh i need only one of them for the time being   125.28862705512472
well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart   115.58241877192512
don t disturb yourself julie said he   133.09665955136532
the door had remained open so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of athos whose wound though kept as a secret was known to all   116.57256067296956
danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered   162.2339437068543
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around   101.32983997031373
but from whom did this ring come to you athos   74.45027239223228
it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth i must confess   111.66548414844574
d artagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the passage   122.97207611904503
if so let dinner be served in her apartments   132.99378600403787
well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation   109.65606654174894
we have seen several ill looking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces   141.05873776656483
monsieur scarron do me the honor said raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company   72.63633814733232
in the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw   78.8279558875567
to be a baron   83.11414589520582
he uttered a cry   154.61893109471066
having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say   62.441929184528526

inquired the owner   93.02808179112192
he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in mazarin s life   101.25663321977156
said nanette   110.69638167006615

these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there   70.49780923231542
well i am wrong   178.3693267022163

andrea cavalcanti the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room which baptistin had designated as the drawing room and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously   123.51152730328003
the two men in black who guessed d artagnan s meaning darted at him a glance which might have been thought threatening   81.79358134124378

in the evening they separated the count of san felice s flock from those of baron cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning   106.78338868576745
answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness   67.6307081817589

valentine looked at m   136.85901381897085
in the most simple and natural manner possible   222.92573447929686
grimaud had a stout short picard cob which cost three hundred livres   58.759130795711805
the count felt his heart beat more rapidly   140.7577011009138
milady let her head sink as if crushed by this sentence   93.22016700814491
where for   171.51173377771028
are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired franz from the viscount of morcerf   85.77545241440036

that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes   96.68751837847186
but monsieur mazarin is a mean wretch who won t dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor   210.2884142710994
but what are we to do   145.2292762138557
and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them   82.87326887076479
speak said athos   46.61138489518798
listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy   203.39175690227393
exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets paris   161.28127362575415
re echoed athos   142.38955440275672
he came to demand the rent of my lodging   80.81261002166185
by my grandfather   148.39900262303632
thanks for the comparison said albert with a bow   83.35084731624492
well sir and what then   84.8252001241943
then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it   181.08803458360364
what was all that to scarron   114.00229677292184
the contract was read during a profound silence   39.1015615858434
his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom   185.6638508295212
i shall be happy to do so   48.51903736106097
porthos looked at the bottle which was near him and hoped that with wine bread and cheese he might make a dinner   111.09904655570722
this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments   84.49095521969105
at this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks   104.48476193834921
for you have become pale in your turn   83.903494668322
the child was born was given to me motionless breathless voiceless   96.15361122077202
and the monk   118.42215188675092
in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten months   40.12921947402282
meanwhile sir watch always watch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here   137.20182920946843
i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight   155.01392449950407

since the death of madame de saint méran i have known that a poisoner lived in my house   166.34805122486958
it is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less frightful   113.3453912969151
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes   75.76713088192429
it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse   78.70446474141332
maximilian has just returned has he not madame   74.99736867681708
and should they wish it you will warn me   121.46381284539035
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there   104.40215182753532
sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such coin   153.85488769412962
you don t think of holding out against a whole regiment do you   170.0592880988264
no in truth   129.37798115072678
milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bosom and red with feigned anger and simulated shame showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful shoulder   136.78170070684922
repeated bertuccio   29.46719687526989
the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous   173.46010125278895
d avrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door   163.54913580245702
kill me   97.74029305377351
shall i give you a line for the vicar of st   94.05174891003209
well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world   173.66415780110657
i wished it to do so   67.61723497490587
the corpse was conveyed to the morgue   95.21697664356786
what are you meddling with   87.28139021357282
and philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery   111.59341237269416
she looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfather s room but on the stairs she met m   117.68848395535876
his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here   27.795976439676167
the hands were white but without delicacy   129.3897063393057
you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am acquainted with all the preparations he has made   29.234948253306513
but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers   79.98212620603542
no be assured i am not mad   66.51718939896406
no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him   116.45703249515259
yes said the physician i repeat it   92.88391030743672
and as she is not in bad odor at court she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will not prove useless to you   76.39536283409171
château renaud and albert looked at each other with amazement   81.80800115465627
you are the pearl of cashiers   138.10789217505146
now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither   118.06277345666675
he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine   172.37537176783084
you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said valentine   133.63383661333313
as one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a dog   192.6843617448842
the king however who sought distraction while traveling as fast as possible for he was anxious to be in paris by the twenty third stopped from time to time to fly the magpie a pastime for which the taste had been formerly inspired in him by de luynes and for which he had always preserved a great predilection   90.01370309374079
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon   178.3729142569051
and this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly   98.35941939621296
once upon a time well go on   102.51519729253654
of the french academy   138.16483926133552
how does this misfortune affect you   99.82251426755145
he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus   173.60318604725038
when are you to pay   102.70508902855399
cried d artagnan a horrible suspicion crosses my mind   161.97110663793362
ejaculated porthos   123.35523142159805
noirtier said d avrigny   151.14364980710457
so there is said d artagnan and he read we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it   144.85722721125188
let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone   71.91718451917626
then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock   174.62183921694714
you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled   164.1352608361141
penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them   218.01614236751186
i speak as i can   106.99614851964088
but no i found nothing though i had made a hole twice as large as the first   114.33920530629355
he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any weight   111.11467444242717
tread in my steps   64.55883568403667
i am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps   185.13849064212576
in bringing the horse out to the water they ve allowed him to walk over the border   130.9066294894278
this was to go himself to m   107.5384844991811
the pope the life of a man   122.44266211476655
he is my steward replied porthos   138.6069392693685
really yes said the coadjutor i have heard this affair mentioned   102.44481060564664
athos has been arrested   84.4203107027058
for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets   86.74977755340704
it will   126.00777081261639
that is true but we then only risked our pistoles   105.02105414860821
in italy   101.53608775973444
yes there is something i wish to see   179.0230514634836
the game began   109.07094914200066
how is it possible for anyone to do that   145.59552876403612
the servant went out but returned almost immediately   93.46351262790105
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service   157.75383248846725
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor   64.35863481775712
is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself   78.67760781334604
has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command   104.40901518446252
come courage   184.82948979725805
but i know neither the street nor the number   139.9439925780002
for mercy s sake then what would you call robespierre   137.18121268859574
always cautious planchet   133.63879336048365
because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject   46.2041450770525
and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy it   36.67661207613803
the general remark is oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as m   151.1093468183538
his threat completed the intimidation of the host   72.20386128524666
in gascony tis no dishonor sir nobody is rich   186.00681001901643
he found a young shepherd watching his flock   171.93876177986994
mazarin made no reply   93.16797699636167
that is not for me to say   193.14688517870792
she resists   96.22481374917706
our recruits from béarn are not generally very rich and i have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since i left the province   180.4275361982645
but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you   70.7714550185205
it was evident that his legs refused to support him   135.1504592341506
i think madame danglars again requires your bottle he said   60.470032260616186
all our servants are busy discussing the grand affair   104.85960563584891
well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures   61.90493478279505
i don t very well know   67.31281638352769
in fact m   188.94722247912068
danglars withdrew   112.80837059853785
why is he not here that i may tell him so   107.29548823809716
by what right sir   153.01116336061816
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat   207.56485662035882
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses   111.54357173809989
valentine said morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger   138.46965074572813
gentlemen said he m   80.1115151670389
nevertheless he pressed d artagnan s hand and said to him you are an honest youth   147.24140302571675
say i have a poor father sir   128.27306719135407
athos on his part had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion and who was named grimaud   74.45362152125693
but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past nine   126.21313531394199
i have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper   35.8106737945607
in the meantime the cortege returned to the palais royal   81.9912263444399
oh no answered franz i had no such intention   160.57605700159402
he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me   49.81513638262636
i shall see you through the window as you mount your horse   40.05633208503515
indeed sire i wholly comprehend your disappointment   61.19371198519069
and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity   129.18243931449655
it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair   132.77406793643658
the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard   213.9625153417917
asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration   147.24055231174816
the guards of monsieur the cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves   54.462437352511195
your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers   15.484423821997424
he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill   184.8931021208233
at this moment one of the door keepers brought in a letter for the president   144.01946269475727
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels   38.155932136078505
why i think said aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token d artagnan may sell it   164.64992078459946
three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck   199.0696197239439
father and daughter volume five chapter 96   188.2833551700234
he also was dying of hunger   94.19472762378899
horrible horrible exclaimed athos   125.09415850604462
in which world   148.9593723206096
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars née hermine de servieux   128.0720820267257
you will leave france you will return to england   105.145233279689
faria started have you indeed   127.17095251409722
unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset   180.34810700925
cried porthos do you think so   117.65723482653374
you must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest care   111.38879559021534
but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room   170.55982346245176
he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now   118.76860943607679
he is saved   119.25309913731063
this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day   58.875720517723884
beauchamp it is quite laughable   117.97358029312959
it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his house came first   65.1663132357873
ah cried valentine suddenly i understand   140.63445860127345
and the count s agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides   111.34663107864051
yet stammered dantès wiping the perspiration from his brow yet i gave you two hundred francs when i left three months ago   115.48263860978795
meanwhile who is in the russian ambassador s box   98.5670638444617
we can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least   189.57882596622287
i have chosen a trade   70.92148324594362
a woman whom i love whom i adore has just been torn from me by force   42.64117363156765
not before me behind me   180.55550219462327
yes i know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise   113.32865907584474
but allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that i am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this   88.03403612397048
on the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of england   37.246498218102545
he bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future   89.01314108392263
porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around   57.31062133710426
0317m when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him   45.26537799222956
you must accomplish loyally the commission with which i deign to charge you and on that condition i pardon everything i forget everything   122.19338379100323
how should i know what a horse is   128.6966851254581
tis your fault answered porthos   86.92200298737268
the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes   127.30309060034139
and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information   63.17494172342492
you resist do you   106.85126474428019
and they set out for boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration   127.35558508352983
i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate   74.08522792697153
i approached him and said in a low voice well since you know the corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word   140.2023282003447
doubtless doubtless said morrel   100.58778803193776
thank god we can keep a secret   74.62593896795096
i expected as much said athos   102.97514597382701
with an excellent master at arms that we have here   124.94486937576598
the baron took the pen and signed then the representative   102.8997559586684
now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table   77.99825783502268
go d artagnan go   72.58464970299984
well let it be then as you have said monsieur d artagnan   76.5067562526653
god s death don t fire   104.6220169648542
the queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and pens   153.50447052983918
but your excellency has not read all   165.3681780957968
and madame de villefort to my country house at auteuil   112.01265273958157
a fourth the illustrious coxcomb mazarin refusing to give laporte the young king s valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months   124.7692693346827
i too would give up that good monsieur broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end   83.46796676114839
sire replied villefort bowing in an hour i shall have quitted paris   146.87639226113478
and the cargo   61.55406771155682
you have probably guessed right   126.67791971362819
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem   138.16007545431748
chevalier he continued addressing aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion chevalier porthos and i run no risk   58.001459431200026
the marriage feast the morning s sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby tinted light   77.83885615355845
you do not know that name   53.65722994440551
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no origin once a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue   105.4569359987173
my friend said d artagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command   80.80254221546826
she will escape us and it will be your fault athos   75.55160057138181
i should like to know upon what occasion   68.47658414396204
if victorious i shall continue the struggle   72.72460981324453
it is he who raised your father s head on the point of a spear   101.40461595020258
planchet go and find aramis   197.92246906402062
do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their movements   89.01144871876822
this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power   196.63980679566174
said porthos there s phoebus ruined   120.6104273113317
witty   159.0618707740388
and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die   81.10609201917691
quite so   13.020025269798765
my dear count allow me to show you the way   215.0443731170289
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of wine   35.071018269202355
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england   104.2152208100488
on them depended my father s life replied she   151.12200381410088
there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage   144.90370189232993
monte cristo seemed in despair   73.946282992626
and aramis said the duchess quickly   24.044697558471327
on this dunghill is a hen who pecking these intestines is in her turn taken ill and dies next day   22.631816300566058
he reflected smiled and replied to me by a sicilian proverb which i believe is also a french proverb my son the world was not made in a day but in seven   111.0736970061614
you would like very well to be at liberty on that beach   83.10853973453288
milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope   179.94194077014345
ah i knew well said the gascon that you were a man of talent   251.57266160050378
yes your majesty he answered trembling   186.9651144070516
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m   110.28093188184948
yes replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy   147.4686497969291
and are the first of men   150.77153992619373
he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh   105.45996059677053
as i have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man   122.59368365278041
but the march of those who remained was not slackened   167.87721316333324
she shall live and with me   166.62587146292788
de tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon d artagnan   106.69126052478234
that evening i had translated an episode of judith and had just communicated my verses to the lady who gave me all sorts of compliments and leaning on my shoulder was reading them a second time with me   109.58620431909827
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel   117.4468982250171
he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie   143.77008930622472
he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure   230.77117695934186
he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of europe often have dealings to the amount of 100 000 to 150 000 francs   107.60101972215986
at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bell pull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present situation   45.38699267393196
suppose i happen to strangle him   156.07924850624323
but what do you do count with all these horses   127.65028788358252
they drew near to the sloop   199.79763339655972
haydée had three french maids and one who was a greek   99.8155953892506
well i will immediately call on m   156.73843746966537
inquired danglars turning pale   115.26851484663543
you have said puritans have but one word   87.36093149003186
by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel   50.186794834769415
that is the best plan believe me   63.83528302476682
said the procurator s wife   109.81236050764981
at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazel nut la carconte s eyes sparkled with cupidity   53.477502055925704
the fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper   34.346176819289084
the major looked anxiously around him   152.5127332781067
nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston   44.05786070142983
bonacieux was known to belong to the queen   135.15806021349715
another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in calculation   96.48083118177115
hush child   2.1184153187963375
you are right said the latter   158.57225405977223
gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies   162.51826061702764
it signifies nothing whether you eat much or little whether you have ten dishes or one it is always the same price   34.46837596689214
and taking barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room   78.210824184445
morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank   192.036521469844
re enter paris if you will let us my good planchet   96.49414499583217
he lighted it and retired   185.54509144286953
a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn   95.01550792418084
what with the baroness   49.362593645272
this is what i propose to do said athos   18.625789817105115
and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you   74.27481372557787
as we have said he was lying on the deck   44.490080414964496
let us wait for a dénouement for the day when the prince thanks to you shall have turned against the court   72.12340803475891
but what has the french academy to do with all this   76.60370290236763
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it   179.60665794081024
oh no no cried dantès   199.08863630647105
making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than napoleon did of his battle fields with his sword and his victories   68.64390201149462
asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count   85.858498009834
i will not miss you   179.13567099146653
when do you leave   188.70795429516673
your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising   84.28800443891757
then you are not consoled   129.62845182901637
you spent it as you pleased   128.33075096008074
d artagnan trembled lest planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that planchet had belonged to him   92.45505270630181
and when   37.68003950679626
dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmond s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope ladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering   104.0304239964259
at these words madame morrel rose and threw herself into her son s arms   121.12857152869596
the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life perhaps franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment   110.69990093572075
and pastrini s account of vampa s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them   149.03452168984057
porthos succeeded him   90.54473704606696
you can not think of going out in such weather as this   164.10592882251373
yes but i have my breviary to repeat answered aramis   161.9816139315414
d artagnan pressing his hand repeated his call   106.3266148854111
i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest   132.85004862267394
i recollect you were saying said d artagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france   87.5097443123077
that s pretty positive continued d artagnan   158.87445121005516
i do not want you   152.2010804708022
and if it please god we will make a good use of your presents   186.07214871833966
the gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went downstairs   7.215213518983745
see look at fernand and follow his example   173.98683345864362
does anybody know   99.3985227607176
i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event what voices   228.63724760919933
but we have not as yet declared war   112.56994427415506
i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major   64.02220997387113
the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character   212.3880395002643
replied aramis   119.13557249174124
you begged me not to leave   109.58892372972801
he hated and adored her at the same time   91.39777700423477
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child   85.99634249996407
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you   172.60145475180565
50165m the young woman hid her face in her hands   53.394887342187246
debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain   119.300704396065
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached   57.64607465377071
what does he mean   119.591697586055
you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor   60.70259249045634
there will be eleven crowns gained   70.57897433288207
thought d artagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived   84.578380605262
do as i do   122.62011988378212
about three months ago i was near having a duel with aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house for a handkerchief marked in the same manner i am sure   85.0047499915728
pardon me for quitting you my dear madame bonacieux said he   115.88176168534144
yes the very one who is lighting us   55.40695270895411
no louis xviii   82.7241811742829
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the château d if were interred in an ordinary burial ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment   142.9252537853803
come on come on   146.75518552239276
franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian   146.1709206014589
and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo   136.07591799364022
what must i do   181.1239157245604
his father and mother were catholics i believe   123.90558954010642
he would not sell his horse   126.50827135985676
milady s son replied athos   58.70877581330195
adieu my dearest boy   65.86603146791109
madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events   77.63719649889346
and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the end   168.31498986512244
noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel as if to say perhaps i may   189.77852132009724
do not be lost with me   105.11270429651464
for the cause which today takes us to england   153.25068328446838
he likes good wine   137.1459938410112
besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of 100 000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality   32.92968880328527
well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me   134.59511989493947
we here present the letter verbatim to his eminence monseigneur le cardinal mazarini i have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england   102.07805045863415
he not only talked much but he talked loudly little caring we must render him that justice whether anybody listened to him or not   139.3934198194303
have you succeeded   112.83362958521408
it was then that he encountered for the first time villefort s look that look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his own   107.00559202527202
but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct   154.76100853654407
that is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time   119.14764937919142
what is done to infanticides in this country   112.597797947381
ah said andrea when may we hope for that pleasure   53.04183606849959
but now what did i do with that letter   109.77818723759115
enough said morrel   141.3175333234312
i can answer for it they do not   88.61966907586346
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education   113.86243551438102
to dinner   110.5178216652218
the mendicant shook his head   86.84998912929653
george villiers duke of buckingham chapter xiii   133.798520554405
i will bless you i i am dying   134.44856677725727
great god she is losing her senses   134.46218423533742
a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people   58.83356249530371
where have you read in the scriptures i ask you that the english are your neighbors   13.320747411135983
the father will never repay it   40.71670987680372
it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it   145.46539885110735
unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these   102.79279951577264
i assure you we are or rather we shall be very happy   76.05924755338053
you will not oppose m   79.37353090571322
ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable   120.9275385643943
and now i am a frondeur not of broussel s party nor of blancmesnil s nor am i with viole   108.56749559317485
i am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that i wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory   127.28005393618709
for soon perhaps i shall not hear and i shall die without knowing what she has written to me   128.82324036587906
a note which you will find at home will tell you   88.23579232504025
dessessart who esteemed d artagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for equipment   167.27817805615734
i go away enchanted   164.18005603293327
who can tell whether mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us   125.70471732835311
constancy and discretion   165.0796867886203
i say that love is a lottery in which he who wins wins death   117.62085389639459
yes sir replied the count   100.39745058232766
he confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade the same who was killed to carry off a young woman who was to leave paris by the barrière de la villette   123.10935044554202
his friend   140.28652867018315
i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine looking fellow admirably dressed   145.85847589131566
what s your pleasure gentlemen   186.8884291450762
ah believe me edmond as i told you i too have suffered much   112.25055337984169
the mission with which i am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed   187.859471471093
this last expression of richelieu s conveyed a terrible doubt   152.53275752917023
devil take me if i ve ever been so happy as at this moment   177.2051671705726
it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith   158.02785575503842
there was a mistake   157.72693086549165
the commission might well be called delicate   78.75911658884078
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a calotte was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio   149.98334303693284
but then he may have stopped at saint germain   142.54755068274847
two in the arm and one in the breast   66.68137819546232
d artagnan and porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his head   82.69151638794327
the abbé then showed dantès the sketch he had made for their escape   152.99345037188883
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him   169.45810268612763
yes yes let them come up immediately   136.14561902361226
they are going to fight   141.07602745030067
then you have received full information concerning my arrival   87.83920495436425
milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs   125.0415289530234
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister   137.03142786375977
nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since   133.20631253891102
i am from gascony it is true   109.92892421254247
i had acted hastily towards him   160.88278024424645
now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation with captain leclere   102.4275746872118
what ones   52.92139899566696
justify yourself if you can   94.19177951888983
would you like better to be hanged in your true name milady   103.74074389393768
the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission   110.07366018212517
do you not guess monsieur   50.456033875861536
you have then been induced to alter your opinion   194.7013648813926
do not go away   95.84310725193274
noirtier rue coq héron no   37.10074213681415
three months since it was m   124.93372177314085
this was the inspector s first visit   194.1788327272256
a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which i intended to carry off valentine to my sister s house to marry her and to wait respectfully m   44.56751519307656
you still owe me something   20.06634292970368
her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts   166.23476022664246
but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france   137.76179841469244
order a larded hare a fat capon mutton leg dressed with garlic and four bottles of old burgundy   173.18608109666172
this last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor   103.5983793972287
but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count   149.49910478097084
and why is it impossible   170.27124726176294
well enough to question him in that language   61.87969885316184
there are twenty five bottles of it left   123.88567806977456
four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton   92.39153393203152
athos appeared   99.53162428030092
i still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myself no indeed   84.15286011924427
demanded the host after a few minutes of useless investigation   93.72858793195017
he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street   97.91327414719196
an illustrious person sends you   206.87726366362784
mundane presumption   67.40719780347224
de villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin some brigand escaped from the gallows apparently   144.26399158418403
de tréville unless added he this is a cunning mode of escaping seeing that he had failed in his purpose   150.51084188396908
during the day i had nothing to fear   186.64219878192796
when it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters   115.58661518932993
go grimaud said athos   142.47977651397963
they are the only men who know how to live   101.05543353674328
well beautiful lady very well said he   44.95006627111289
i can see nobody said d artagnan   114.70182858490845
mouston will do   181.3263228417055
if he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride   89.86570208872209
but the convent where is that   163.78052423070355
courage sir said raoul to the wounded man   100.43272324550884
oh dear grandmamma are you worse   106.46476192531634
adieu your excellency   65.02643840078952
remarked a third   127.14623221522199
prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades   228.72667648614168
said d artagnan i had forgotten that he was only a musketeer for a time   199.7650490945176
well asked the count in arabic have you been to see the old man   182.67051078345855
stopped terrified at what he was about to say while richelieu stretching out his neck waited uselessly for the word which had died on the lips of the king   124.36082589457986
at the end of two hundred years the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars   35.71705883960287
at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with a loud voice this verse in jeremiah god said hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom i have sent unto you   170.83407771275068
at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a man s stout and furious thundered behind d artagnan   160.63250411906913
my dear sir said monte cristo i understand your emotion   13.74901332729425
and the effect tended to increase the expression of self dependence that characterized her countenance   15.547736359504214
and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness   164.19498374817817
grimaud s agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news   101.88801814183002
no listen to me   80.15975301938084
d artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme   124.7597747573794
it would have been so unquestionably had not god given me so large a compensation   150.25866300858064
de montmorency and lafayette   58.00389276397287
he returned to france with the epaulet of sub lieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a captain in 1823 during the spanish war that is to say at the time when danglars made his early speculations   145.3166571405572
ah that gives me more confidence   82.18973641946283
he s not more cunning than de richelieu was   144.53134102049094
but as i was older than fernand and had just married my poor wife i was only sent to the coast   72.93218800069386
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused   125.03660632399378
in fact a moment later m   45.66016226481577
alas resistance was far from my thoughts   121.28201699704063
i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken   81.04587134483283
and when asked dantès may i see all this   101.93461680952879
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir   72.31896605581936
for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns   64.59960139686714
i thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated   176.21162167382371
but all these reasons were combated destroyed overthrown by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over us   77.45659116212195
the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the swiss   155.3708529826867
from the same drawer she took a man s complete costume from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was nothing superfluous but every requisite   75.25327017323431
very good very good said the voice   106.72447800575227
exclaimed de winter   171.08965229900681
they said she had left   177.73279862569086
do you permit us to open this casket   44.377284603172825
two hours have i been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if i am going   112.31254417570894
my wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them   126.88001945276496
added gondy turning to la meilleraie   154.04047880161932
maximilian villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief   109.28838950967733
d artagnan thought of the appointment mme   144.16164029245348
gentlemen resumed aramis any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have had you arrested for we have friends in paris but we are contented with another course   93.76390300481458
pardon me at least such i have heard is your custom   93.38011971029749
but your highness has never seriously thought of it   151.72794500522176
what is allowed then   177.8396727081385
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night   25.74300164923625
go up said the host   103.25199829841918
that is convenient   58.79770943171958
i will not die alone   89.34115845775749
his excellency the count of monte cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion   117.68136007710221
heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing   123.9206198567405
andrea assumed his gayest manner   44.25470277615493
but he can easily become one if he is not already   2.6521839971120613
then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps   169.51475446976343
i tremble to give my permission   145.86932531736852
asked the queen motioning to raoul to rise   175.2280137108727
that credit sustains him as breath animates the body   58.433347730490155
de schomberg   160.06079931150987
this reproof stung athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing d artagnan foremost in a coarse ferocious crowd had been very strong he contented himself with replying i am not calumniating you my friend   121.21972923010489
alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon see   96.73248263145359
who says this aramis is not a wit   129.20790642947995
exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can   31.802582946058962
i confess it   132.9876201039878
to eat do you hear   107.89114300712298
well said aramis beaten by fate   1.193615789880397
why do you address me so coldly so distantly   109.74777784022262
on guard then monsieur on guard   84.3351304017506
wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished   38.82745867734461
the rain of blood as the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glance but there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened   51.449067270229804
the carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed   119.88541220776918
are you ill   186.6992945422753
but said the agitated mercer do me the pleasure monsieur to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while i am in prison   126.93822542646834
the duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace   137.61885476860442
he was if i recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many others   77.67310028560783
among friends my dear athos no you are right   131.67796943927567
i reached the age of twenty nine without loving for none of the feelings i before then experienced merit the appellation of love   130.99259043202872
i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me   81.84952753648602
de tréville touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his musketeers   176.7231777415206
the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window   86.4731491917291
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them   86.5835435966897
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope   95.8567750354816
he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio   128.1669116606023
then taking a passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months longer   70.44782906686356
said d artagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted   110.17086127607729
proceed   91.72400837580659
some unknown enemy an invisible foe has done this   136.44935711448892
who has been here   142.28557472944925
magloire   75.81573802111151
and what do you think i did   101.28333996580935
danglars speculates whereas he never does   75.1980167585061
they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen   147.58642007403148
you are setting up an establishment of course   88.29965595827653
my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said morcerf   58.796686701793554
will you assure me it shall not be signed   78.74652667865867
we will attend upon him with a gendarme   57.098021430781465
it is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it   155.02035707134922
is it to the judge or to the husband   146.1582961511404
madame replied gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition   149.37724704609127
those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each other s hearts   57.84969207538498
tell me how can i do otherwise   70.8041101347703
rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of living that will signify but little that concerns god you and myself   160.5540716276978
it is a chain of recollections an idea which carries you back to other times to other places which very likely have no connection with the present time and place   86.78677391479992
and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmen two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other   103.24999880726851
you consent then   94.58912084131188
come he said tis a warning from heaven   116.15074648861466
the messenger was unmoved   149.69179450297656
the count s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man   108.22801116728483
mine you have heard and that is to pursue you on earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of god   133.8818378617212
you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the king s service   131.10981263673204
then the landing began   136.28622328247084
the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow and knitted his brow like a man disquieted   170.37670628827962
three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate   77.67446827076424
and i will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the persons   123.7849303983349
nearly thirteen millions of our money   113.911110413605
he had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting maid poor kitty   118.15489941903864
this quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of m   102.81501969762483
oh that is quite another thing then   101.3986649536107
because i was shown up the private stairs   73.41321130400634
do you understand father   111.92193011802661
asked richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance   108.19186396257126
then all was dark again   75.0303734465261
whereabouts downstairs   133.57063061062388
after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon   72.70100905743081
de villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs   153.59392517098854
and since he has been here i have watched him   121.70487722929893
asked madame danglars with an anxiety easy to be understood   35.648895982044266
i have denied god and he has abandoned me   52.97306855314835
but you sir   113.27747072728722
and you should call it devotion added aramis   57.670299924183375
said aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military life   173.08160267048635
i will question and do you answer me   124.9657547127039
de tréville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nights for they set out on the twenty fourth at five o clock in the evening and as a further kindness m   137.97577878212968
but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey   163.25072758694793
they have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this blow   177.13186456747917
d artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp beds   143.5114925005924
let out your prisoner   145.41092266191427
tell him your name and show him this letter   218.164332826874
immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it   146.20337461461838
well now then the count   114.88059593295237
then shaking his head sorrowfully poor haydée said he   157.32163987369697
i seek to divine nothing madame   134.91486166821997
as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone   171.65134828914142
milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes   106.88697525141914
tell me a little about it my dear monsieur de rochefort   110.32265676684638
well then what do you say to la specchia   152.5626437142084
we have quitted business   76.4819071729718
this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months   126.39227015934509
that is to say as often as you can with safety   112.51935373244177
the handsome madeleine announced to d artagnan that planchet had returned bringing mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit   159.79155877004135
and so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult   137.9557655277796
well cried milady in a sharp voice   97.73109200499552
madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road   77.61459887994931
the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either faria s or dantès cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain   98.56969442255401
the clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tongue tied   90.92140331574521
speak i beg you   139.26783091246995
she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob   134.27420454860962
return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch   101.32490391377766
an announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family   215.84503944562056
comte de la fere   110.19297126626583
d artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy   63.24857074495565
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible   105.95522925344359
and she resumed her narrative   65.51847640486383
happily he did not meet anyone   132.025840194719
how does that concern you   68.9898175963065
this way gentlemen this way   146.96604299428142
but instead of that you come to paris   13.492610551233469
he left there three men   140.26809521536111
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose   130.4698274314987
well i will take it then said d artagnan   76.30218310625423
all five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of béthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came to   78.80538020424862
he said in a low voice   103.32883922142872
he would never forgive me for not having preceded you   101.21256180679781
you are in error sir answered the queen   97.86247500828874
yes returned the count i know who he is gentlemen   102.63375702160442
but all four together and without a scratch   170.19760773478342
anne had never at the louvre had so large a court   132.29796580861517
besides were not those riches chimerical   107.1303673270852
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death   120.21766108085025
from which besides we can not retreat without shame   156.3530253106432
after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound   64.91018078635753
milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise   170.02759071998855
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired   213.10814129071503
he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word   176.34956384883344
murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal   102.37417972159807
enter the guardroom said the sergeant   196.80217219243883
you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder   94.76126294387889
and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner   178.26039811821317
well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hunger that is all   165.59754970114994
cried caderousse   147.95406014444467
the guide carried away the torch   65.41436257703154
the cardinal put it on in military style   130.42285810375424
no said lord de winter we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england   34.97867732385451
he was one of us   192.19589073344923
madame more hopeless than he thinks   81.95587350126902
he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point   98.18533676685772
you think then as i do that she deceives me   90.09660833678878
this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in one syllable verse which i began yonder   9.739912446053609
and which of them made this passage   63.22795883286746
murmured danglars   39.54146449679682
ah my dear count you are far too indulgent   99.5963017757957
kill said she but spare the honor of the widow of ali   197.67381826431654
his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him   131.9304224042068
the count retreated a step uttered a slight exclamation and let fall the pistol he held   113.79394536812683
this costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellow creature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption   172.40736285211594
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole   151.23502474164263
pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is 22 rue de rivoli and that i am at home to my friends every saturday evening   65.86502363418822
he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken   111.08320872738545
do that cried she and you will have saved my life you will have saved my honor   165.66217813341524
d artagnan made a sign to porthos to redouble his watchfulness   127.05932052600231
is regarded with universal esteem   65.52746333902232
said the young man who in spite of his self command felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow   155.48499282667316
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscount s age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert   114.69860546034427
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned   115.00139603457617
it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel   41.41253081766992
your order shall be executed my lord   132.2010236600056
as d artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to porthos and as he was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends he held out his hand to the wounded man and told him he was about to resume his route in order to continue his researches   142.90290056022064
a man who has pursued her a long time   87.5827122493737
as for the duc de beaufort he arrived from vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces   181.5425179110348
but there is always the same result   131.80336538624408
they have eyes cried milady but they see not   118.31074930325029
no answered porthos mouston has no desire to fight   169.8463610228014
d artagnan shows himself chapter x   110.68422784841947
in the case of a check he desires to retire into france and to live here as a private individual   111.36487055119606
the moccoli or moccoletti are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with first how to keep his own moccoletto alight   126.52518316196938
so much the worse and so much the better   124.93367814776907
call him de bracieux or de pierrefonds   130.36353034476284
a conjugal scene at the place louis xv   100.52655303064775
violence he said to himself would spoil all   180.80261731880978
in truth that italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man   79.7822540268518
and what did you do then   104.34021743289628
repeated he   83.02395941485914
look at it said the abbé with a smile   85.51952200997795
i had informed m   170.28407105321148
said he pardon me for having denied thee   85.86313790249048
besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom   100.28195047013608
the count knit his brows and remained silent an instant   105.71495737430847
and mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular inspection   151.3701697796561
but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy   98.28748909976058
the physician has a sacred mission on earth   108.06666320254226
tell me tell me tell me i say repeated milady how do you know it   188.57771577465468
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward   224.4024553124216
so from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable   35.32359382462603
and if i went to seek vampa would you accompany me   65.04968278429527
but how could a dose prepared for m   103.70172592131416
shall we see you again to give us any information   60.155728702817086
i will place it on her table myself tonight he murmured   173.4719335607465
i became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences   94.66299930452365
athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword   72.262477757309
do as i have directed you then   98.95964945128426
dantès easily recognized them faria had so often drawn them for him   164.8629815143904
he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten o clock struck   202.21417765636275
you should not ask a stranger a foreigner for news   29.84303179009663
dantès cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude   77.0251967165321
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their masters   73.1701769886022
but it was a legate à latere who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him   68.99150892149606
d artagnan shook his head   167.4193510778505
i will go there where i expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to l epee du grand henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty   155.62313487029076
the cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for albert   91.62314848231983
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal   92.45454736182768
doctor doctor   123.74297720315467
i can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged   156.22193953143656
i am incredulous   94.22896803383715
the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing room   122.04957711367815
uncertainty is still hope   66.14878161990521
no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you   192.7251081517769
ah pardon me said château renaud   16.708799250670936
at armentières   81.60945610174511
the first is that my mistress will never love you   100.0274152952739
tomorrow at daybreak   147.69451504353685
i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on   164.49312720106386
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the duke of buckingham   138.69268243161042
i swear to you i will   106.07573987007304
the servant announced the young man   212.55375825489477
a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped peppino opened the door and the count and franz alighted   124.90404147748995
i destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at marseilles on the allées de meilhan   83.25041724277207
but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed   78.25612756062652
abraham raised the knife against isaac and isaac was his son   128.98743779042965
who will tell her   62.653086082948306
twice he was obliged to step back   127.78705424302873
the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury   147.13345177711597
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur porthos   121.64591036112922
anticipating your wishes i have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages and ali he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the boy with a smiling air will have the honor of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash   121.03425479729643
well happily i don t say nay to it   159.4557468439483
he wished to see if he could find other traces of violence   92.94715070715675
scarcely had d artagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night   135.72085342381231
if the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps i should not hesitate   136.26425351563105
ah mon dieu   167.45472620062267
well we are beaten   116.66253827283033
grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask   132.67711338208431
that s all you know of him   55.2719756662809
for a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him   163.3795247175127
we separated at midnight   15.691754918056631
in about half an hour the girls went away and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an end   170.47334237095845
supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness   189.9084283304432
indeed my dear sir said monte cristo you are revoltingly foppish   101.05077279138578
well said monte cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house   55.11389578550412
i compose sermons my friend   205.8501259334795
i was going to say that i received a letter almost to the same effect   157.28582024765788
ah if poor mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction   69.00372615931988
as for de winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright   166.69816570967419
she looked at him in amazement   171.89828989818398
did i   150.88770461959794
cried mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends   12.387552252686731
you have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between us   89.74393768338204
he guessed likewise by induction that porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of chantilly when the procurator s wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse   189.69627023886355
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness   143.32007961471837
apprised in time of the visit paid him monte cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants   221.9599760547401
that is strange for it is a week ago   83.14900186963422
an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never   140.20727276483908
raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure   132.79953068118334
i am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine animals   167.51604156216274
well let us sleep at noyon said raoul   195.1984127913704
long swords but light purses   101.28584014640354
my son i bless thee   6.877499273631784
monte cristo advanced into the room   159.8327567113516
and we did not surrender no   146.5530559250208
i can manage your business for you   165.61181746535078
monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time i came here   87.88498291901138
and we are not always twenty years old   95.67801444377776
at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a child s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined   68.57559152960769
bonacieux expected to see milady but she did not return   131.05998578625577
did you ask for me my good friend   127.77884053229182
oh the admirable police have found that out have they   81.88904637823609
but you wished to be frugal and consequently to lend at usury   92.56268408967817
reflect morcerf one moment before you go   63.52993602430107
here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table 15 000 francs in gold and 30 000 francs in bank notes   88.08373533894203
island of monte cristo all i poss   87.13061058791024
villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter   154.30127874795832
i know him well there   123.48661850194938
oh it would be a sacrilege   188.5185384203253
d épinay and the following day the contract will be signed   89.38942048355938
your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with   96.2782618734121
the fact is said d artagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves punishment   82.27328924983459
de morcerf sets you the example   121.14316538900083
tis thou rascal   88.37891100169028
and why if you knew me do you let me die   224.32463661191838
julie mindful of emmanuel s request was following her father when he quitted the room but he said to her quickly remain with your mother dearest   109.999268598921
i know that replied the englishman   115.6470649705588
put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of   140.96763033568266
cried d artagnan don t call him porthos nor even vallon   81.75086885331416
you are right cried the affrighted mme   184.5910527725291
as for winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were petrified   131.96907110749757
and why today rather than yesterday or tomorrow   167.59621878779285
with the condition that they should sin no more said beauchamp laughing   67.92147035766149

and surmounted by four stately gilded weather cocks   44.86749583160973

at daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of caderousse   115.78835405194191
inquired the owner eagerly   96.5425285808356
then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment   103.43870836845512
not a step further he shouted the queen is signing   167.61559536806436
in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions   136.6370925292955

he rose gave his seat to m   87.08751885537376
nothing ambiguous if you please   132.4296611250692
in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lord s passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy   113.55000457186314
is it from mere humanity you bid me live   141.79126528681672
cried bonacieux terrified   139.44445766479407
don t you think the executioner might be master cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself   162.3471968289679
but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and grimaud becoming pallid   111.16672638511633
a deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved   118.74891292409573
and it is the same with puritanesses when they are pretty   162.33442886193706
well how is it with this madman   78.61034023421067
sir said d avrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late   84.06986042506972
he thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to advance   124.65530977216531
the young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at la canebière   112.31199723847143
you are aware that may be bought   80.50299778838044

your majesty s orders shall be executed   148.24935177201257
don t let us play upon words sir   103.32225095119021
exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy   103.47152566449043
yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our own not against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an italian the queen s favorite   101.40491763527532
in the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held   179.93026277824805
he went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop on the road but gondy reflected for a moment and then said let him continue his journey   201.54297091258007
and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything   83.7197424615097
nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of france   25.63943114444247
ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken   157.69775002718373

he looks displeased   114.66009713606748
you offered me hospitality and i accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof   11.195243433617705
i made no resistance   61.151642481252445
the next thing was to find planchet   109.90716856346276
the same evening all villefort s servants who had assembled in the kitchen and had a long consultation came to tell madame de villefort that they wished to leave   132.7863439731625
i wretch   155.35212509071218
de tréville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queen s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful   50.992735221686786
his itinerary was promptly determined he would go to dammartin from which place two roads diverge one toward soissons the other toward compiegne   72.2784559268142
they promised upon separating to meet at the duke of bracciano s ball to which all rome was invited   147.39826415843663

at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment   60.934204421390675
we shall be alone and can make up our accounts   174.06908451922538
it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp   62.71558987365909
there was spain which made war against the king   147.49115622722405
when groslow undertakes this kind of thing there s no need to go over the ground a second time   145.68067297672812
well but whatever expenses he may have incurred i am sure he is in a condition to pay them   124.83229457113964
everything had gone on as usual at the palais royal   185.18574093956528
laporte went out   54.386860424581656
0127m meanwhile what of mercédès   168.3433473834559
he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape   81.48324876216667
in devotedness or rather in fanaticism what his ordinaries had been to henry iii   159.93962054957
take ten men of my guardsmen and search the two houses thoroughly   52.82471730407223

every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo   97.3547012689487
asked the gentleman whose name the lady s agitation revealed   156.67106514622026
exactly so said the host   126.77909685884725
still the death of one old man always considerably affects another   139.95361500845536
you my dear monsieur de rochefort shall have the post of confidence   25.482046389061125
and i cried d artagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me   79.73907414431633
but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant   79.16621238845379
but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project   74.81970014404311
be tranquil and go wait for me in my chamber   114.31718008970589
in truth said porthos i understand   162.68373691983396
you were going to visit monsieur de la fere   145.84870792574432
blaisois replied mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask grimaud   50.51718826578028
but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold of   75.33280126400257
how pale you look   79.4701673820328
and now said athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign   103.17643791379949
said athos shrugging his shoulders   165.4757505283029
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath   115.94320504498671
would not one say he was speaking of a religious community   62.71067555195855
bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other grating   127.06396822303394
and who knows which of you is the most fortunate   163.23363654445467
exclaimed a voice on the stairs   177.85391498769707
but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask   84.70724490304318
chapter lxxiv   77.29533704564973
yes sir replied the young man naively   154.69843311466238
go sir then said the queen   168.73860186890323
say my highness is furious   143.31849607645827
he arose and stood near mousqueton   69.42125428614847
and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3 000 francs   84.88903692232338
i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and i beg to apologize to you baroness and to mademoiselle danglars   118.49422745211903
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth   41.955679581665706
hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered   113.52451378929302
on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded   161.8662431883838
30185m madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority   84.2640709285644
cried aramis and porthos at the same time   127.52042629332377
but the gates were too strong   77.09668868710563
the letters were long the four pages were covered with closely written words   120.52830968917868
i shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight   246.00499710214063
mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make   113.98398772773041
it is a beautiful diamond left by poor edmond dantès to be sold and the money divided between his father mercédès his betrothed bride fernand danglars and myself   138.28055143422907
30119m what precaution   108.26709290801811
besides what is required of a young man in paris   26.745126271050395
i understand how he would act   159.11683003506212
as he mistrusted me he determined to guard you himself and sent me in his place to get buckingham to sign the order for your transportation   189.44012088619823
he found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants   99.08292637808967
captivity the third day felton had fallen   166.70142359868848
but here are your bonds   80.99281200349859
i say that he has hastily accused your majesty s musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources   134.52319943005696
why have we not a grimaud near every prince   75.66746840382827
can it be otherwise   90.31621454213538
and they went out together   167.37300282640973
and besides he said going out of this chamber isn t all   168.90053936389586
they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis   27.23665016199078
inquired the count   94.90055881471842
this is a fortunate chance one that will delight his eminence   148.3916531678825
one day benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree   176.1646801325303
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence   45.13746594434831
bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way   70.20721028304968
woman woman why do you have such ideas   190.99821860669624
it is true that since i left him i seem to have lost my senses   85.5669245202736
if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent   138.15834951381524
a thousand pistoles   43.215032512063644
and he made some steps toward the door   203.25847338730193
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard   57.246625198384905
de morcerf as you saw   143.1476875472644
it is unnecessary we know each other so well   84.59911235064676
the fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played   89.04130146698056
no no read exclaimed the queen indignantly   120.30269117549605
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper   78.26269419847478
oh beauchamp beauchamp how shall i now approach mine   180.83736828762596
mouston replied porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm   160.7500438227985
you think so my lord   105.25911467140655
and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first time this garden the actual scene of my crime must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause   153.19382390472765
and you selected it yourself   55.86601418574281
then taking porthos aside my dear du vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for i am going to take you to the cardinal s   54.76721433295524
yes continued athos four times only   129.38764710687593
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dantès if only to prevent your growing weary of me   62.81313669295938
and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands   196.50388696438256
amongst the catalans mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any   170.21352925132965
well suppose it is a bull fight you are going to see   76.89935488028017
in an instant dantès plan was formed   126.31496752442959
the greatest my dear bonacieux   139.2747823770883
today then at eleven o clock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay   38.17554231114973
of that great that sublime sovereign all which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son in law sir   130.2837806112677
i am at your command sir   154.29971564172473
danglars burst out laughing   175.17414242742447
tire to him as my sole heir   97.62089958688286
cried the soldiers and ran for their arms   188.4288662075822
a roman scarf tied round his neck   71.0559002195701
there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them do you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair   115.21229984118685
i can not hear such things said as that   86.58434568418892
ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad   132.42968773099923
i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted may consider himself in safety in comparison with you   126.96691583131341
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said   151.3940737350194
my lord added henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire   183.868057283327
you called me didn t you   78.78439932202434
then i admit my patience failed me   126.85592459794054
muttered porthos with a kind of pretense of answering   156.70131379033882
bertuccio appeared   187.15259504580789
he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming laporte with questions who replied only in these words sire it is by the queen s commands   86.18677006615164
she was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the prince de marsillac the eldest son of the old duc de rochefoucauld whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the duc de condé her brother in law whom she now hated mortally   85.75706862570043
a folded paper fell from edward s breast   129.9483378851488
you have a longboat   160.43616004665833
the overture to the second act began   163.514773909229
anne of austria bent down and whispered in the young king s ear say something gracious to monsieur d artagnan my son   153.90246160518979
speak doctor i am listening said villefort   182.18188881237688
at the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully equipped   119.2492077268991
you are deceived monsieur   104.23268719875426
in truth murmured d artagnan to whom m   97.22585910485505
cried kitty   107.19956864869268
there is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime   142.7732048223991
he committed a crime it is true   48.64374543072117
ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes   75.60533235485806
he he incur danger of death   137.08066536751932
it is they who on the contrary overcome fate   126.16295651123602
yes yes indeed   131.68110350663795
and could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying down with mazarin as fell those at jericho   92.47025949917588
then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a corner   72.50540095628129
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est   148.39935546335715
should the king prove a tyrant for power begets tyranny serve love respect royalty that divine right that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy so that we gentlemen nevertheless of rank and condition are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there extended   120.21678734344479
i was giddy that is all   53.55100872524901
you told me so just now   145.34711648705945
one moment said the prisoner in french   108.0374134000824
so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time   123.40860867556411
morcerf had expected he should be the guide   64.57626991537376
that thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen   158.3185716189422
let each take seventy five   127.27127195383568
shall i bring him alone   155.90050021133078
the count felt his heart dilate and throb   198.96586969521536
at the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only 50 000 francs left   74.0766401193251
but silence   82.28347145569427
she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure when on the very evening of coming to this decision mme   122.7770715644988
he must have written to him   98.53292651748089
and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo   106.46949022832057
he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion   74.0644082871762
but here is m   138.75958981421712
it was with difficulty that de guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monk s bones   162.59580668265596
do you think athos will be sorry to see us   67.8574283788036
the executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him   139.07914375764247
said debray   124.72920994813875
but that act of self control effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess   153.17549853822865
the pretty landlady was desolate   181.90909889554487
by circumstances   81.73185280459352
those wretches wanted to take away my sword   92.07102075068313
only impenetrable that s all   88.26298243420374
the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air   140.6732020852984
i shall take better care of them myself answered d artagnan   192.20050861998845
but the king is with mazarin   140.36869157851513
i sometimes wonder replied athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together   85.80524602023978
should dantès not return mercédès might one day be his   105.79970975978863
morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son   121.7507606052105
there was a brief pause during which louis xviii   91.71951376841133
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity   81.56523727528413
very good said gondy shaking rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him   165.62044868338245
and what hast thou to say boy to monsieur broussel   83.70830369607076
to yanina   155.11011584484652
d artagnan led away the swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand   90.96889375748303
one must take the world as one finds it   124.62086656902602
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind   29.914095498794012
who retreated a step and frowned   152.11023594794025
you are a great politician my queen said mazarin   105.92722924069942
as for me when i have no candle i can t take two steps without knocking against something   136.16142378713974
the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine   125.48534559054713
how can it be otherwise my dear bonacieux   89.26009765556229
but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions   121.1400272272933
oh count what a service you might render me   102.391236672537
but this i know you have some motive of personal hatred against dantès for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others   75.56331001852257
this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch   126.57946074835147
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression   81.9410035156138
who is speaking of monsieur d artagnan   110.9002998106858
i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going   99.91346472109282
this was the chief of the band luigi vampa   100.77233827958254
he thought of what was in store for his poor horses   169.44942542105116
as the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window   165.2809496793567
at length he interrogates me   118.66526151997357
i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated   136.18861874781214
and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind she repeated them aloud then finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant no she said come since this plan does not answer i will have recourse to another   63.62121587513341
listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure   51.23549648071232
danglars turned very red   142.13289517272435
i shall have to watch the men who pick up balls   120.42339941654433
you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed   72.90354093353697
things go wonderfully   170.63942229738336
he was a picard whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge tournelle making rings and plashing in the water   98.02576861061718
is it not countess   100.35606574994199
aramis therefore had written immediately to marie michon the seamstress at tours who had such fine acquaintances to obtain from the queen authority for mme   123.73568024104105
my father is the marechal de grammont   140.46250608219842
i will leave the paternal home i will give up all   66.21814586236417
when he came within hearing he exclaimed i am pursued   130.50439644974978
let us not misunderstand each other replied monte cristo   126.26104498658519
hello here is my watch   72.13509613371014
yes and to hang me   114.95631184571083
help comrades help   164.59583780925496
the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle   29.172490571459335
i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i had twenty one five more than last year   101.82440087965117
then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound   115.24244386762055
the host who was not endowed with great perspicacity did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger   88.68923340228596
but by what means   188.72263029635252
and we shall not be made chevaliers of the order this time   84.18379480611006
have you wanted money father   110.4331468259325
he was quite prepared for any such encounter   149.98197047351806
upon that athos yielded   19.76761540932354
and therefore said d artagnan to clip the hope which athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity   107.90109309843915
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man   145.92466783859714
well all that was useless   126.68009015093095
although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you   85.16703406348078
religion and its observances had made felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions   88.55472318779624
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count   61.486750344593894
we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us   152.70406270893835
faintly murmured fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance   104.7155475180901
a carriage was in readiness at the door   30.964183147739618
and you were right cried aramis and porthos with one voice   74.12072374642682
but asked dantès how long shall i have to wait   83.03330690281187
the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hôtel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gaëta as on those of corsica tuscany and spain   140.78994128352838
wait an instant   58.532971849379315
what new calamity   110.96751055209155
i will go myself and fetch the lemonade   184.12683751645682
they attracted his admiration   158.65739693490855
i know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue m   155.57442513728216
he is asleep   57.69352643045771
de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned   140.89076368201822
charles stuart said the colonel of the english regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner   111.80132220819385
your breakfast shall be waiting   112.34336006570584
said morrel when he was alone with the count   98.04386648150401
the letter of madame de chevreuse   164.60662876134273
she had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent spanish genet and an andalusian mule which were beautiful to look upon   105.53161094618669
at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday   186.38585117835913
he died a more wretched hopeless heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon   170.01946323657577
this strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your reason   11.80722571797071
yes yes my lord   90.75810088494974
the victory was complete   96.35491283750738
you should have traced her   95.71226275370017
as to his title and fortune as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte   179.54758194531792
we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too   115.02364971749176
and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said porthos smacking his lips   70.4634875966353
it might be imagined that he was a hundred miles from the capital   68.14908371512034
a greek   92.03490976702886
and you my lord   171.71189785064695
i see but one impediment   124.83223495556776
but d artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him   82.8907690243731
noirtier you killed my father   88.24300773415057
yes monsieur replied the mercer in a tremble feeling that it was at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing   135.1416336317355
but what the devil are you about aramis   115.20170526100429
and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances   129.11428466105775
the mother and daughter passed the night together   64.57511023656039
but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears   76.91050532327762
he is entirely devoted to the cardinal   121.67231563920241
her maiden name was de servières and her first husband was colonel the marquis of nargonne   161.04966281144243
two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt   62.35610714125999
my master has commanded me to be discreet   145.2905827897988
it is only shown to me to terrify me that s all   113.64309877408111
near them were saddles and bridles   123.86701312547214
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered   163.13782274623605
but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other employment   115.24386046331314
he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty   141.37856252645363
milady was wrong in fearing that mme   93.93283545788196
in a quarter of an hour at most   90.32358838304594
that purse contained sixty pistoles   81.19567913937948
her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time   187.62052221007485
but this is infamous   84.07518908783867
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead   159.3157248179861
she is a remarkable woman and i only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger   127.88264081571896
noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which i am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion   95.58651512100147
and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father   101.75826770697503
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to d artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel   177.70630490588326
but still there are some signals only addressed to you   100.18222547872793
take them   58.30874972933593
indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed   99.71835020770327
i will do everything your majesty commands replied d artagnan   68.45878131051529
then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him   125.16229412038712
pardieu that s true   118.14352900186344
what is thy name   82.62061763278203
if i had missed you tonight i might not have had another chance   121.0800317159849
let us drink while the wine is fresh   105.81489309417537
was it a corps sent out to make a diversion   99.31099822140814
d avrigny s look implied i told you it would be so   104.9678606474192
let me be on my guard   96.35808390132144
yes in italy   141.39370195757033
something bright   65.24428839658228
yours if you like   56.18638708927994
he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake   123.72075451497366
the count alone seemed unmoved nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks   104.62240156694308
and now my dear child adieu for the present   145.31652381458207
perhaps your love will make me forget all that i do not wish to remember   203.18965543245668
the word is rather hard   174.6536536187008
i know because it is my office to know everything   131.20805224882406
you are not an enemy of our holy faith   136.7934531050389
now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues   67.75124033001114
a fine and white stocking a silken robe a lace kerchief a pretty slipper on the foot a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty but they make a pretty woman beautiful without reckoning the hands which gain by all this   73.76141002375573
the curate related the incident to the count of san felice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month   175.69256973789584
ah reverend sir cried caderousse clasping his hands and drawing nearer to monte cristo i may indeed say you are my deliverer   104.74653761014505
i should think so   114.21026564052485
and you ought to thank her raoul   83.92638511079105
its odor charms one of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it   82.6364294591369
swear first on your honor not to inform him of our return   137.6119607546202
benedetto you are fallen into terrible hands   96.57374498774914
but what can be the matter   94.37971765419329
i inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on men of the north as on men of the south   157.44137109035935
planchet began to weep   83.69728808807156
is he a deputy   110.92524610251049
gave me some days before he died   121.5175129621242
he was called benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents   99.51925873146193
mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her cheeks   145.87642006861654
the names have been purposely concealed   184.2406159675616
yes that s probable said d artagnan   123.52005236219426
the old man made a sign in the affirmative   141.4162723464172
what then to do   16.05517749141282
no voice replied to hers   98.97945878661129
without speaking to anyone but yourself   201.2729515621677
milady saw the trouble   111.1870092534864
do not be intimidated   99.59645836114369
all the ladies rose and there was a profound silence   131.53301042026843
count said villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes   150.65228997439448
we have no time to lose in regaining our camp   138.39255595409543
but to whom then   173.33086368028313
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st   141.7165148569849
and taking the horse s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him   115.44392861464992
danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say   142.03692916804167
ah i recollect replied the count   124.05714808929957
d artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there   191.18278859929768
exactly as i have the honor to tell your excellency   115.15557080931592
d artagnan rose took his hat as if it had been his intention to obey then opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of milady   102.51034803783274
he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to act   33.73407192604371
yes noirtier   158.3030017949907
signor pastrini had promised them a banquet   125.34790791844397
grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door   135.8124195107306
besides you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort   106.02012851510759
the wine you prefer   169.57787873871706
back   47.407815495607665
you will guard him well for me   140.73326923944563
it is exquisite said athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young man s plate   116.53896289668549
previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle   270.0547855802264
for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess   92.20378265758187
i know not whether he is still my friend but since that time i have remained his   91.29496738749702
you are poor and your future prospects are dark and gloomy   44.83077334530239
do you find yourself badly lodged sister   138.33630998439324
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place   71.24335200630281
milady was a phantom which when it had once appeared to people did not allow them to sleep very quietly   121.3048164787831
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as much but it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second   112.08625915319347
but father take care   50.94951595811206
does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing   69.65730827727069
30277m indeed   110.81017588527625
valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and villefort was biting his lips with vexation while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy which in spite of herself appeared in her whole countenance   177.41295625831955
he hastened to the side door with ali entered hurriedly and by the servants staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant   63.21648419848142
grimaud signified his assent   154.8409264564769
andrea turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible   120.49094823083851
i know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries   112.391374367204
light the candles in my apartment if you please   124.52114400339804
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged   161.94436804503613
everything in her mind was lost for an instant   104.13213531317544
i m surprised you have never so much as asked after him   124.22920139744532
i know something of him   36.94856183766281
she makes the young look ever forward not behind   147.29167783672915
his reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of him   59.69139468192252
strike me   89.36701316300571
young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet   133.47092845212077
monte cristo remained on the same spot until maximilian was out of sight   117.69575469211807
danglars shuddered   72.623369088461
should you know those doors again   73.60001945065898
and he lighted his cigar at vampa s torch   101.73697996416756
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the count s safety became now quite a secondary matter   215.86435281464452
do not refuse this little service   135.28269249227284
idiots   143.34430010582372
the postscript is explicit   82.74371904334205
in a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught   162.40084156364574
continued the giant in his quiet manner   127.25359894740245
i think that with a hundred francs a month well   109.56213464565663
it was evident that he had touched the shore   133.42077239479832
at the house of m   112.79429620743915
at the moment when the hand of the massive time piece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door   89.95357577135005
asked comminges   117.66364745221705
you may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city   131.50357051346464
if you are old i will be your son   75.63588863864283
someone is talking in the street   37.77206333923334
have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us   190.88172759497746
d artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute italian   69.64583580139016
the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand   160.41435123957112
the four friends were reunited   131.5737093911186
cried d artagnan and spur for your dear lives   129.83711806004274
d artagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocation whence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword   118.54486665927442
said château renaud passing his arms through the young captain s   54.737010088406144
but now he said that you are a widower your wife s connection can not injure you   137.80733612563455
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept   200.50052993926357
neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance   165.7575604138809
30047m he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julie s voice   114.72593398584941
ah she cried what a frightful dream   153.61074903622153
they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to d artagnan   171.69289609502846
my first care was to run to the door   36.42223555272987
so much the better for me sir if you speak to me as you say with frankness for then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions   81.44997609484791
monte cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit   118.56609003991232
she stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the three none other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed put her to torture and she ll soon tell us where her money is   133.7224315415072
i know it and i expected this result   118.56287570797387
more pale and menacing than athos d artagnan stood on the threshold   49.16059476035056
at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do   116.30932574600496
let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone   154.9470766892759
said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny   100.08924564090218
then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind   157.3414186830229
have you a letter of audience   100.66841232882953
d artagnan did not budge   105.97391163123811
he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men   54.08699422470352
follow wherever he leads you   98.22792066156862
she has never been so kind before   172.49686006025632
he bolted them both   77.14118570592544
at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the door keeper s voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups   110.4576453262267
in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa   121.7713260390539
he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the other   52.208054432038075
and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret   85.5444031897649
i would willingly have said two words to mordaunt in this little desert   85.4943188761542
do not look i implore you my king   29.54839489391766
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man   73.65886571305484
advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour   146.25344381412606
make yourself easy we are quite alone said andrea   154.67210330366984
as long as i have known her always   119.60809070340909
have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us   31.420585055641553
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart   151.76238831061775
it asks if i am ready   185.7292039390993
chapter 116   75.3669572710179
what business had you then to go into the chamber of monsieur d artagnan your neighbor with whom you had a long conference during the day   129.2907655889359
your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is   62.30883550410634
i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand   129.59609590910085
well my dear friend win it it is at the point of your sword   47.82970472030192
nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing room   117.14874713069163
the plan is his own   77.47339166628095
oh command and i will obey   105.50006689062246
she was forced to return to tours   171.47897425370158
in a few minutes a night watch passed   71.4425246718174
there ll be firing   138.17828596046968
however he like cæsar borgia knew the value of time   125.68162224725523
murmured athos in a broken voice   120.67344103195771
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity   82.64948559129223
athos smiled and d artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover   94.1485297474048
but as i have told you it was too late   67.8021880908185
the cardinal looked then with great impatience for the news from england which would announce to him that buckingham would not come   95.80089726566044
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men   90.21135686871924
in a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits   73.51260023988951
but i have seen them drink it   67.09713597606051
i swear to you i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path   98.68112243306823
caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest   87.1036352816671
after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy   70.29552582088716
in that case i shall expect m   139.75308548542785
but i was going to tell you that i met m   108.69145575727282
my love my blood my life   91.891561675503
but why need this annoy you   106.4278039110796
well said mme   48.74158276825334
oh she would like it but but what   96.87575879048708
here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty monsieur de conti received damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal   124.19637248375984
well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord   86.38203069951123
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect   158.41367808841719
morrel at his death left 500 000 francs which were divided between my sister and myself for we were his only children   43.95271316687766
they were one in the rue de vaugirard no   110.80072085430098
gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray château renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m   141.95892029153526
we thought so too monsieur   131.15413512858711
a great favor   185.5232274657963
now we are pigmies in comparison   124.18200004243411
privately   165.50629534870745
in a tone of reproach ah monsieur i had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman   121.2492412214532
god bless his majesty   128.76985158964388
athos did not reply   66.08495810716786
and yet frightful though this spot may be it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered   105.700049622324
i regret that i ever crossed swords with you porthos   173.86015622277822
and moreover my dear child continued d artagnan i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian   103.99435677212476
who arrested you   90.84531623371609
dessessart   103.8225987885216
oh man man race of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do i recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves   197.97901663292907
only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas   178.86639755516129
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man   134.33258982719317
it was a clear profit of 15 000 francs   145.20778967024484
and what did the officers do   47.95194129166093
said the listener not through doors but through windows   160.90889809998032
his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble minds mercédès had always had a sincere regard for fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude   97.93383515195029
in your service excellency where everything is learned   76.23029847623918
i grasped the railings   53.5135133504624
say i am condemned sir if you please   208.1071347000582
the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar   65.41405601022376
resumed the procurator s wife hesitatingly   125.37591194862743
steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer   109.697216388715
there is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the frondeurs   96.22418147121913
we are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven   67.81725000887415
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he   166.2388413540679
if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his head if anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three days if anyone had said to either of us then live the day will come when you will be happy and will bless life   163.10236048092466
ah said mme   187.9056477592726
the queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question   52.19418773424349
my profession condemns me to celibacy   35.86924251344023
impossible madame impossible   106.74265800353155
if an individual project gutenberg™ electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1   111.19679830026125
while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared   49.03583623631589
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it   99.56093830293815
then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in french comte de la fere are you there   77.38906050526354
but they will run against the bottom of the ladder   133.57989036721284
the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled and affixed his seal   60.504822475979445
and now whenever he wishes well whenever he wishes   82.99681775522524
it was the plan of alexander vi   138.27140241045672
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank notes   127.1564965197716
bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone   98.32110252873792
you have 200 000 livres a year and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200 000 livres   156.8813198508731
the cardinal knows everything   80.5881581448271
yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos   193.58516040065024
have i not then that right   62.214712952407154
it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them   143.73441828397995
two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass through   28.68347472894618
we shall soon be well acquainted almost friends   105.26851462624795
de chevreuse who told it to two or three of her intimates that yielding to his vocation he had retired into a convent only into which nobody knew   224.83473101211257
remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow   94.57125133557129
her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird   57.5602072271582
then tis i who am mistaken for you have always been a good chronologist   83.85345660681622
do not seek your wife read d artagnan   129.44969344445755
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress   152.35488293944664
planchet only touched the tips of the count s fingers   87.92498115623819
his face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement   133.97612544727065
in the name of the king i arrest you   57.29741304102231
it is not only a right but a duty   205.0955037323056
were you present during the last struggle   63.270638529349945
groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and dice   113.84753096457116
i see no one and yet the ladder didn t come down of itself   134.43994107712484
mademoiselle de villefort my step daughter said madame de villefort to monte cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand   75.23049095036049
but why is my grandfather allowed to live   136.57193656314845
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them   143.183239710548
madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features   84.53721603875894
d artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for   171.58677203637643
when will you do that   150.12096431468495
lord winter answers for his regiment or at least very nearly so we will not split straws about words let him place himself at the head of his men we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty and we will mow a swath through cromwell s army and reach scotland   134.56222768361891
listen my dear friend   91.56683970178881
why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of porto vecchio   148.9783639610594
the young woman hastened to meet him   117.7481696600606
he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday   155.23221122493624
you yourself gave me this comb   120.11586274311418
it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs   70.13167291144991
now gentlemen a sortie   92.99181374372941
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me   139.88825046402215
come come you won t tell me you don t know aramis   122.43523130793183
exclaimed monte cristo shuddering   108.10801091456251
since there are two of them already there let us add a third   149.06818185093692
however for my part i would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor   131.87919957509715
my orders were to carry him off alive or dead   99.87039584468093
for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercédès my betrothed   131.3400415874953
i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side   93.41328676772322
and yet they refused to buy it   72.9745788707789
it was not poverty which had broken her spirit   67.13633799071846
still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire   129.7093118289128
there is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond seas   120.90924311918006
for you   123.21299837996129
the two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails   221.19291074352196
his interlocutor whose head appeared through the carriage window was a woman of from twenty to two and twenty years   133.86561583047492
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me   32.44266425510817
and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match   146.73825773600618
i certainly never will get drunk again d artagnan   102.97678037934736
as to d artagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate   127.46693196463184
and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age   109.90245499616812
how do you take it   145.12925466283733
monsieur laporte go to them and again recommend silence   77.12847061132136
i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor   169.3145093851724
and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over   152.0821313863813
as soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon them   145.4327774898786
you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali   79.54476917967374
the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act   131.20908794889564
in fact as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit   103.71546053599323
that is whether you really love me   73.51163863758174
they rode on in this way for ten minutes   109.45844739391126
by its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy chair was valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and stiff   60.46974406248511
for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation   119.95189443193566
i guessed all   106.38423834089141
de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house   124.20705248917461
so then they have paid my ransom   23.51079965644415
is there anything else i can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friends   103.27629072431105
adieu gentlemen   134.37718406176865
and these researches   140.854405532578
the diamond is real   16.974550375580435
at last their hilarity calmed down and faith   89.83231395181521
athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground   198.55320401102264
i was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying oh   52.87010299558184

he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late   80.87695755205729
unfortunately for d artagnan among the spectators was one of his eminence s guardsmen who still irritated by the defeat of his companions which had happened only the day before had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it   198.3612979448833
there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you   55.28713400007764
asked grimaud   50.89955855958283
and yet he but desired the good of the people   109.03564965548597
they don t burn sorcerers nowadays   141.7315324177954
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release   120.07086442977491
i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses   106.64029152201567
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf s or jackal s   115.47391562453193
then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes   45.09452859055635
you always come back to that   22.64187926702381
the devil he is   147.42859439474273
d artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear the fact is we that is monsieur du vallon and i hesitated a little   81.83234293069395
you do not speak affectionately to me benedetto my old friend that is not right take care or i may become troublesome   94.91476962748962
he smiles at them   173.36842627318003
he was the first to jump on shore   156.41153471548287
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse   92.07002143127278

the frenchman knocked at the inner door and entered the first room   171.69606991988042
he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses   144.39813194111315
d artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended   154.32447219194128
he was nineteen when he entered the château d if   103.19551162801058

valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner   175.8091101849973
but on arriving at the kitchen the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage drawn by two large norman horses   118.10862587773518
it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at all   163.16817938344667
as to the government of normandy replied the queen i think i can promise   81.28747604248454
la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted   175.80186366276843
if m   94.44455807252396
they will kill him you may be sure of it   144.1576331471711
he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder   87.17740364395209
a cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain   116.9741811362535
but how inquired i am i to maintain myself and my poor sister   128.89819405171517

the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton   80.08925001096392

ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen   101.66258029318249
his coat looks nearly new and his boots are brilliant   149.20832058723894
morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre stay he said m   125.95448509106437
he fancies he possesses an immense treasure   118.08439386895797
duc d harcourt fontrailles and the others escaped   142.5196528977614
that is rather difficult but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty   166.23809053488733
you know the character of the baroness no one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases   130.99413823927998
i gave orders for my coupé to follow me   107.38038247688493
said athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him   60.51073573121214
revenge for instance   120.74457053121168
she wished to see me to speak to me   182.6391001065216

in the first instance to marseilles madame   64.45151715006554
and you really mean to say   66.711955435401
the king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the palais royal   116.29258003348376
a mere child   109.50272858499625
the two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley   130.24165112936976
i am patient but go on   123.06406161264219
pray observe that i too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title   172.11725920945042
yes the marechal de grammont is right   117.61266476663279
but do you stay   102.63005434842779
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road   166.20948374570986
i do insist upon it   66.42820331778105
with such a fortune you can attain every wish   57.61999186104588
the queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious   172.2865209906281
they set out passing over the pont neuf   103.47846141413972
really i think the thing very difficult   84.62436093084979
he now called himself du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds and resided on his new estate   53.977994423809385

d artagnan went straight to the stables   155.2390450237598
the inspector kept his word with dantès   201.89618844384353
beside his taste for the fine arts which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic   115.74464282119133
but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune   26.71787584423123

danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide   89.87581732005066
this same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt   59.47012279887712
and yet that villain benedetto will escape   163.7187016882522
i mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not by her infamy soil an unblemished name   160.03573567945173
may you not have been philandering a little also monsieur bonacieux   108.17182140254275
the eyes of the scotch flashed fire   185.66099048951898
i promise my lord replied mordaunt   69.09606625359433
come now aramis said d artagnan you must be taking me for some one else   156.59936530358053
on the contrary if i accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me   197.34733494289435
she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty   56.60775065878362
and all present even including cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man   196.75451042058455
and this officer asked albert do you remember his name signora   102.07262451253581
we have met him twice at general cromwell s   94.6459008227291
therefore their first idea was to join the enemy   119.35012206945792

bread a la fronde hats a la fronde to say nothing of gloves pocket handkerchiefs and fans   66.31211220960856
less love than politics replied d artagnan with a reflective air   121.8960683306458
having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again   112.1343325821515
having aroused the enmity of the sultan he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822 at the age of eighty   66.69769025183423
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh   98.78622733029862
ah cried albert it is very lucky that m   138.02537831021763
tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them   68.58203433716449
madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count   80.63311439157076
my friend i think that he is much troubled with gout   134.33529671724756
take it then and pray disturb us no longer said madame de villefort giving the album to edward who then went towards the door led by his mother   126.38505281924839
and with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps   59.40343166231241
ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know nothing   136.30091260019992
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy   130.6210944003569
deserted   81.79660382148799
i say i want to know why they should put dantès in prison   136.16751671711705
who are you madame   104.81621682892808
a few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with chemistry   168.28243116676686
but let us return to yourself   185.18511113605564
at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos   146.81995224423406
oh difficulties do not affright me said d artagnan   140.81671901184882
sir said the gardener glancing at the sun dial the ten minutes are almost up   14.600354770041776
she was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her hands   150.09002727040576
for had he not come to our aid neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks   96.86472899751419
the abbé busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future   164.58978122819633
what a brute of a host   131.0851134414997
a woman could go up a ladder like that   162.42835095486265
but i can not so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life   33.710242653457414
what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage   106.63278683102297
entirely my dear count   73.05909557851888
it was athos he had recognized and porthos who was boring a hole through the wall   136.61086256055341

cries the captain   153.31934184041577
milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled   125.68811005284543
how my fault   93.53332812050328
cried morcerf   136.65252632134118
monsieur still insists upon seeing him   89.34014285648264
sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards marseilles at other times gazing on the sea and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus end her woes   100.87798523445205
but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer   130.80614935795538
leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me   34.6444140378227
but please ask at the hay dealer s   59.05002982985389
at the death of monsieur de tréville who is old i may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless gascon   69.04916453413634
the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman   62.17218279505382
they said it was bad money   170.64387063498077
his eyes were penetrating and sparkling   88.96344372741531
i then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment   97.0987836323858
and now his eminence confirms it   54.32858002153757
the procureur shook his head   110.43161735267718
i have proof that her majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his eminence persons who had served her   115.15377096989225
oh you may even see her if you like my dear mr   111.18662874387063

my poor girl you know him already   147.64695629273018
he had learned that dantès had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city   160.09487595400245
then bending again to raoul he whispered above all things do not divulge your name   121.80659573871795
it is my will morrel   94.83736011669816
come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want   88.86579033057497
the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissary for he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion   159.63239851866416
now as i am not egotistical we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her   54.22001462682363
oh no returned monte cristo negligently   112.51341990120295
they are about to send into our court which monsieur de mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend him   223.55259188863778
not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined   142.53988327791944
no sir not at this moment at least   92.0954374670738
julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived   103.75516129785494
to beg him to assist me in finding my wife   178.66288971875744
ah you gentlemen of policy   155.1831897049957
there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators   101.97039660358399
allegro   77.54072760853295
but has the wounded man retained his senses   103.78502799711464
without further explanation d artagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the richelieu gate   145.3166400380788
and that would be quite as much as i should ever require   109.46616197692123
he was about to marry a young and charming woman whom he loved not passionately but reasonably as became a deputy attorney of the king   142.7176051325179
why is she not come   116.7114998561276
yes replied the stranger   109.70266836955716
the initials are only mine c   128.127893424952
for pity s sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressing for pity s sake do not call assistance   107.38327299899356
a lover is never terrible he said   133.94977635428398
the cardinal seemed furious   97.25342130818709
in our position one must provide for everything i shall try to gain the coast of france   86.92650776856347
time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite purpose   85.9787481076645
courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the queen   113.29269510316738
he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so   169.6507231013126
these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder   170.7064471141309
and madame de villefort two   142.46291296104772
and eugénie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise d armilly   114.20806528665916
decidedly you are a brave fellow said athos pressing the young man s hand   166.5953449756328
but it must have vexed m   152.67218650245889
first her closets were thoroughly searched and then she herself   89.38339965646102
what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say   187.13439809115727
the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition   125.62154557573896
you will describe it to me replied franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it   120.606576843005
cried the procurator s wife in a transport that surprised even herself   213.60483500233465
but don t exceed your orders   94.56257608111042
that s better cried the abbé   77.99420758435559
grandpapa says it is a panacea   153.96934548707992
ah you see how it is said athos becoming still paler but yet attempting to laugh   58.92410184413751
you don t do your work by halves   122.98349664638047
le duc de la trémouille   132.86232769812443
really said she i believe you now begin to hesitate   59.55077721163018
you see i am more candid than you   95.98709686518157

i could not see the expression of his countenance but i felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed   73.90759521514249
you forget aramis one precaution of considerable importance   143.41210342511087
well then i must be contented to imagine it   133.044707890628
do you talk of a sacrifice   69.05599390747075
and now said milady without appearing to remark the change of the duke s tone toward her now that i have received the instructions of your eminence as concerns your enemies monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine   110.78601953587363
comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery   165.19387003660736
you will know when you reach london   99.16090244237026
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind   152.0985009143467
stop i want to remember his exact words   172.84268908600777
and i some lamb chops said porthos   190.63288047996292
but one fights only with equals   69.32971643395163
the count de guiche was awakened at five o clock in the morning by raoul who came to wish him good day   87.22321668281394
be easy said aramis   181.72717479017666
tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten o clock i shall see what color his is   135.15557749140746
is it thus you perform your charge monsieur   120.5448187123456
i my lord said the latter i know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt   95.802665757656
monseigneur your eminence is a hundred times too kind to me   60.058975933423916
but in the meantime saves the country added athos   46.42280152613466
at sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a man   118.1007714313497
i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror   14.139754601838845
every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice i am he   108.69262503876396
you see we were quite right to pacify that country   186.78851376290268
politeness you simpleton   138.8487638865149
the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone   122.31772357562318
i spoke of them because porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before me   107.46836039180127
to any one laporte the child said   98.70827407857769
well repeat it repeat it i beg of you that i may at last believe it   87.50774220574169
a tumultuous movement shook the partition   219.63840393463855
are you ready   152.45578389656433
it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason   101.89700714965466
who told you there was a woman here   21.446738192550157
but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding   33.97735108126835
but have you ever watched him carefully   56.28178236566291
it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful horses   143.8250409731849
but you may have excited jealousy   85.8317375364748
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him   43.46107278987094
and who afterwards sent the cup to me   95.8326282815899
and the count placed the packet in the man s hands   102.21507902678076
but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade sellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east   131.23099633281777
i know no one now of that name   27.997875741203842
do not call him   148.9024572467391
he has already given me good information and he may do the same again   172.3151621179112
sir said monte cristo to him i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings   27.041432621056316
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf   143.4457116759055
it is mine monsieur chevalier   99.9478769844223
has the daughter of ali tepelini spoken the truth   97.71717500204562
mordaunt he cried   70.31347013222137
were you pleased with paris sir   116.04977559568651
last night after we left you   120.45798011580756
he has seen him said athos in a low tone to aramis   147.46192832080118
there are circumstances in which one can not except through cowardice i offer you that refuge refuse to admit certain persons at least   75.80270387390051
dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness   71.73441624271874
i left it when i was but five years old replied haydée   101.82685290193407
felton grew pale   83.72739908494376
life is not worth speaking of   129.82151000200213
bravo monsieur grimaud   124.03785954265602
but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say so calm remained her face whether or no she had heard them   83.71420931300857
the general was ready the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage   50.650407423110735
athos saw the movement   180.46337569626422
there was a momentary pause   165.91389972717528
he repeated   100.94493595631069
but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon d artagnan s sword   138.29129810095046
for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound   94.83220493260009
every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less uneasy   124.58645418334109
bending on one knee he placed it reverently by the side of its mother with its head upon her breast   43.09366294168484
this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from a serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to d artagnan with his hand and addressing the two ecclesiastics   132.37942143795044
are you not the captain fernand who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor ali   156.484573540925
no it is charles the first the king the good king charles who despoils his subjects to enrich himself   117.16893515205322
we are out on the king s service   123.60297880545555
our best born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain it   102.02379423485938
well take your hat and gloves returned monte cristo   31.65407978729283
they had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by monsieur d arminges   168.85445846454408
she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening   101.40961232509137
i gave him the helm and descended   34.06435737697521
in that case porthos will assist us   100.9079805735407
the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes   166.46212979921796
before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a movement not a word   142.83390310984555
addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested   201.40154702122405
there s only one man in the world who could stay my hand   135.06474120102587
forget you   60.63358935790289
good said d artagnan to himself   86.41163688911743
she having been sold to me seven years previously with her mother who had died on arriving at constantinople by a french colonel in the service of the vizier ali tepelini named fernand mondego   69.78018485417343
i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck   144.32594765901905
the night was rapidly approaching   76.1420511435764
i might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him   93.3106698228284
are you still bent on departure athos   167.04712446104145
a person to whom i can refuse nothing has come to demand you   51.500573072650184
the way you came   99.53620720220079
he shall go thither   101.62618672436565
but the hackney coach drove on and the head of neither mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband   82.20230131293825
d artagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in probability   129.78541770169647
it is tiresome to be always acting manfred   79.54414830529021
albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it   187.1760505308241
that will do said milady   31.139392258278704
never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success   96.40918510712305
a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him   140.80551461057485
but how is it he is not already returned   165.25778909923267
who besides don t understand political matters as we old soldiers do   99.61600710900393
but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chained up dog went up to the cabin   31.879125174981027
and why you   96.22467972045833
athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand   147.9113444838281
i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities   87.21339644284502
a gardener   97.69254018273242
you promise to become one of the lights of the church   157.56597299426608
boulevard de l opéra said beauchamp   153.66703373314033
caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor   123.99732124802807
she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hours together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere   108.15512524614806
mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle   129.6568465520411
and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him   198.3617821531724
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy   170.55280395522078
for i assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited   77.74274095608952
that is policy   137.9548688400527
you can t imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he is   118.30613540890005
whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old   28.805426287273576
buckingham   171.28633139908595
parry who accompanied him stood behind him   130.0182252401101
i was not so in my youth i was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles   40.21578236964878
but tell me my dear lucien what it is that constitutes a princess   137.9290843915411
stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies   43.45867746855063
de tréville the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet he not thinking to shut the door against anyone and all crowded round the wounded man   110.8875055287221
louvieres was proud and satisfied   53.11097270402879
beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts   117.49721468255463
sire said d artagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question   138.10182792173694
possibly madame   157.0408039515441
but was it my father s ring   173.78739040965272
how old is she   183.29452441266506
to mademoiselle valentine   109.4799459023227
i held a similar project but as i had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me   132.9224289487031
your guardian   132.13529381239525
and he went   40.70964104308935
well said morcerf for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppæa while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl   107.0675982440569
bonacieux eagerly and looking at d artagnan with disquiet   50.241642864493016
the queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence   159.58512640215122
for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes   109.06627251055508
thank you gentlemen replied albert with a smile of indifference   162.17738211304558
oh continue   143.60387926153356
i think so   146.9098549534597
ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o clock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated   121.46579465092643
come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair   97.59059349263916
where is the man who brought the letter   76.61044892180965
i said they would skin me thought danglars   185.7164615857955
but happily the abbé busoni thought for you   126.7168736644573
a delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the sea   139.72281711313883
he was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to la ramee s heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination   179.62535548638607
i thought you were angry with me madame   2.053315815043959
the two friends sat down to table   160.84235086003056
one of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a club   170.7100889003871
bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her knees   64.47789198851717
in her room with the notary   69.0343077642494
he has this moment returned   78.74218882920978
the queen will revenge me gentlemen   246.559898323006
that was your business   188.21636971977313
but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of milady was increased by his not having killed her brother in law   135.83198653432538
and what has procured me so flattering a distinction   201.68320698856257
oh shut up   132.573542975907
but on the other hand there is abundant question of you   43.45997399987883
felton named lord de winter   129.81205861252434
it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek   122.7089944213716
has this woman been relating her crimes to you   75.89006630844867
no he is a countryman of yours if a corsican is a countryman of anyone s   56.608103589139375
nevertheless it was necessary to finish   108.55261112488381
said the servitor opening the gate   159.82129600158532
nearly one third of the paper had been consumed by the flame   169.9102913674797
these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him   93.63859368151813
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him   100.39281293522367
that is a matter of course my dear m   116.56004757014183
cried both the children throwing their arms around their father s neck   92.9865928042803
for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself   141.5691184656077
it s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health   121.53911169855724
agitated by fear torn by faction   132.3665298063607
still she felt her pulse and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain and for a short time she suffered less   191.92710190724938
ejaculated caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die   152.45085109163008
but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base   24.44374028525806
porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet awhile   168.86873361300923
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut   114.70058857088439
my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which d artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same   41.50807725225454
you must change your clothes as calypso said to telemachus   104.00091955479635
why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever   102.52456781801132
they shook hands   163.81828374471326
you have robbed you have assassinated   120.54949653708233
so added he turning to renée judge for yourself if it be not important   136.3607893873839
he remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet   62.1009117234117
there d artagnan was asleep upon a bench   122.69356696246018
would you like to become rich or at least independent   180.5817712687999
how can i help that my boy   221.6659963741916
but pardieu if you don t calm yourself i will design a second fleur de lis upon one of those pretty cheeks   176.3996336009714
and for the rest stiff and proud   132.72593979025737
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation   88.01894060993403
then the count added aloud was his name ever known   114.24088496497455
you are wrong morrel   54.02966327976127
pen ink and paper muttered fernand   87.94294071841082
on the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of bastia it will be called the eurus   164.2588835541446
the general depended much on it   119.52125017326122
you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning   121.11382011437945
such are for royalty and we are simple commoners   205.41922586112565
much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not fear   132.18317317749725
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye   124.6709632780119
caderousse terrified looked at the count   75.74407955469817
if what you say is sincere replied athos he will never reach london   92.92211482342223
and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st   156.12590297438464
exclaimed albert so overcome he could scarcely speak   84.7471894831047
and if it be not within a thousand leagues of london attention will be paid to your wishes   142.46422955393905
the baroness was astonished   150.3629819331266
you are mistaken my dear viscount   245.91802212341534
look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abbé and then observe the lines traced on the wall   151.34531793973528
and d artagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis   80.01534395298923
and he tapped gently at the door   86.47048645252634
ah you have seen aramis   135.27243195948063
the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately   129.24295242818442
no monsieur replied the young man   169.28116600129158
tell me i entreat you my dear doctor that you may be deceived   47.06181834865609
said caderousse shaking his head   220.15913991751498
that is a strange question said aramis   117.41608055511601
you will in turn enter it my dear d épinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family   199.814404575497
to morrow we shall know if you are good in action   59.3898641643879
he has a prisoner   173.24053419152762
i am in the vein   116.61564307714622
it is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the doctor   183.64411793324942
you perceive then that he is not happy   58.30622268079681
and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm chair   161.33663787516323
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined   152.34139403686743
politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything   119.35434883574898

d artagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody tragedy   149.83329489645536

i was retreating on foot for my horse was dead   131.6559959570277
my dear d artagnan replied aramis you understand when i was a musketeer i mounted guard as seldom as i could   108.0519203420646
in the first place i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of   108.97076501081827
did your father speak of it   72.29469969458768
the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the right hand crypt belonging to the saint méran family   120.90677409532525
said aramis you will find meagre fare   64.61643047472546
but what is the meaning of this change   46.616877793989104
from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he wanted   169.1168771081747
it was about nine o clock in the morning   120.38785379357836
well in that case we can manage famously said d artagnan   40.175517229383445
exclaimed dantès what is the matter   54.99683568040399
the mandaïa 6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer   89.82022820336185
you heard it for the first time at marseilles twenty three years ago the day of your marriage with mademoiselle de saint méran   139.3797829317333
the eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons   96.77577397703902
oh you are beautiful always beautiful   51.445216720652695
it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered   117.32493754653206
asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be cooked   126.47126693680033
i have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow   93.59144974341056
and why i should like to know persisted caderousse should they put dantès in prison   213.24377868634355
i make a match   95.56536033409328
and no one thinks of us in this country for each must think about his own affairs   105.04818713915387
no said villefort rising hastily   93.65888088670899
no my friend i was wrong to caution you   104.79663260101921
you are brave monsieur d artagnan continued his eminence   152.11591015540523
let these three gentlemen pass   202.2207883444981
he said but can t we have post horses   142.37320715355014
then rising in despair he exclaimed the chief the chief   145.11783975915114
you may pretend he is not here but i will find him though i dig forever   181.70688758296228
it was fourteen years day for day since dantès arrest   116.88704859749245
what will monsieur de tréville say   55.88063409308833
the host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to   127.27832587786602
19 in the old greek legend the atreidae or children of atreus were doomed to punishment because of the abominable crime of their father   101.91797773480714
you are aware from whom i come   162.8520071093641
the first time he broke my arm   74.85744725444434
excellently athos but what are you looking for   107.9244962503752
my dear fellow don t speak like that of monsieur groslow   186.95496127404846
when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom   148.6901017126604
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far   153.84461115827298
at madame de villefort s proposition he instantly winked his eyes   172.01297536547082
speak speak in heaven s name   94.62604382082912
laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the king s place   196.0890950099036
but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir   184.92368692313266
your horse seven against eight   72.51407154175632
the king opened it and found in it two diamond studs   129.38613727827024
you are right my dear monsieur bonacieux my friends and i have been on a little journey   117.69085148991707
but during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from madame de montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew not   164.8987546338673
a week ago continued madame de saint méran we went out together in the carriage after dinner   127.22431425838477
i am highly flattered returned beauchamp   92.81628782819166
let me conduct your business and my own   100.98825263294381
but since you believe i act for my own account adieu my dear friend get out of the affair as best you may   72.7367887334733
he questioned jacopo   81.55427167934207
let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller   147.16995580482453
but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name   129.02397882509356
he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation   144.49631865579246
monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel   158.81000529028404
suddenly d artagnan touched something warm which moved   105.61805953435963
the latter continued in thought   97.67120840926546
poor count   63.451883156387176
i saw madame de saint méran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said château renaud   191.52759633259018
many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself   167.16210588560614
at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port   176.03274046002267
the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available   176.23583202721332
the seventh he let it remain upraised   145.87785559448915
villefort ran upstairs without saying a word   102.90220120085208
and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out   111.09092692569358
dentro la testa   222.44684390812637
the other by buying off my judges with gold   149.2388276538917
albert and beauchamp looked at each other   89.9295253847398
two hours thus glided away   219.38329151840946
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran s   117.9749885578542
no said danglars no decidedly no   135.10637097954069
i will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will say   92.3700098497502
they then set off for rueil   63.22408940796782
inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise   82.97220567656908
so d artagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarin s   137.6062661495708
are the oars in the boat   145.534145824749
because you are a coward planchet   46.92163388167482
or dreamed he was and awoke mad   188.98362083987865
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption   138.8427616777691
oh i think you swore eugénie   50.116399017783934
the request was needless   131.80041023311054
the unknown day for which dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned   52.565383708873185
well it surpasses that   147.4268433687206
then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa   187.9900888164624
but he is mistaken   171.751418599734
said danglars i ll take your bet   171.27399196782915
danglars is my banker   132.59744866492474
because monseigneur mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to breakfast   152.17652552225076
bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue   81.72966992337024
did he speak in your hearing   107.86225975109429
he named to guiche the people whom he had seen there   28.343807707529876
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm   185.29357562691013
but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against you   108.13971122317002
i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis   82.81962966828081
but the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel   29.710011678337793
saying at the same time you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you   85.50439011060607
you will give them to your son who will of course take great care of them   141.52945092949176
this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office   46.25244251609617
and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital   112.00599545391819
yes he continued sadly shaking his head yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us   131.68446130495818
he felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart   60.43969612671879
two persons passed near me allow me to conceal their names for the present   118.61832485220175
that is a different thing   171.54552465625193
such songs disturb the mind   135.74957027545292
time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when vampa should be twenty and teresa nineteen years of age   138.55373151789763
athos and d artagnan watched their approach from the window   22.618547024682613
i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends   187.28988643829018
thought i that looks like my handiwork   70.79633246150205
we ought not therefore i think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition   44.950406009313085
do you hear not a single creature   129.3594185239065
these three yeses had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder intonation   18.599821699854118
i have since learned that he was confined in the château d if and i should like to learn some particulars of his death   132.19014531273268
then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with regret   122.4714165293465
no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer   46.61206856171181
he then repaired to d artagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own   169.95136738567638
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step   196.42007903193883
do you still fence well   95.4466138599549
you make me tremble   92.84782872797788
i say that it was you who desired me to drink it   91.78904303165308
pray don t mention such a thing said the count   121.11117878331234
explain yourself pray   148.4400315243685
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known   63.69270161672776
danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven   87.00783309846027
this instant i entreat you   126.76086610026138
on the contrary this dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape   139.1216398527262
no one commits crimes here   88.07357211524176
why did you not tell me so before   140.49164925096883
and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the lord to combat her that she has succumbed   105.9480813043141
i agree to it too said porthos if d artagnan approves of it   169.79285655683395
that s well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door   116.9464156691232
ah good morning my dear count said he   91.87097172625234
i mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain   38.70023158407923
ali cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong   97.203581961422
the notary bowed   133.78210577211573
but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan   94.39608455338423
that i can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word   96.66037037082856
i heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself   54.821769242717785
you are more impetuous than you were returned d artagnan   54.981057105466626
as she uttered that bon mot she arose and asked for her carriage   181.17061984976124
president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i can not follow you   168.38413579066983
not so replied danglars   97.70429905348065
but she is not mine   72.88916282106797
these two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with spain the quarrel with england or the embarrassment of the finances   142.95107456628557
of having conspired to aid the emperor s return   123.94115505425466
de tréville was asking d artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour   131.8243529394843
madame de saint méran wished her daughter should be married there   95.99091554302069
but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is   98.29964483634839
gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land   101.77960993150491
the cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than ever   38.74431754733013
yes but in my soul much more than in my body   141.5041611539619
morrel has promised him the thing   126.87748870544834
they ordered the driver to take them to no   127.77849760009988
i know full well that you don t turn your back to yours   123.73468684749761
i know so many men already   114.67442938252752
could you have believed such a thing possible   143.68257430965508
have you really measured the world by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles   146.28079511432335
but i do know you have nothing more to fear   133.25609675977654
i will not detain you long   55.43772948098935
and he went out as he came in whistling the self same air   106.67963138027488
unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say   137.104352078556
demanded the inspector   137.70922086230757
and this one had his said d artagnan   128.92701578332472
neat remarked d artagnan   92.21851674795195
the sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm   102.07258642785935
are you afraid for your young raoul   83.98830620653372
you forget count that i have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in you   151.318366617737
cried d artagnan not in the least   120.36279572912858
my dear athos i have reflected on your arguments and i am convinced   200.38287331981897
there s not a day sir that we don t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of monsieur de gassion or of monsieur de bassompierre   135.5231253118638
eight days after i was back again madame   107.72835646127345
seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited   131.75002027363803
from the audience   132.43674676648402
but sir once more i beg pardon   119.18403941574326
in that case i am the man you have to do with   161.48073815858072
have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave   207.11786663346697
the baroness became enraged   61.98822208126632
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once   95.54421764988524
to make your will   64.91154596674606
with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence   99.82498655554876
to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb   83.34974298621853
cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity   106.7779598634442
but meanwhile caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need   96.17214597410364
i could the more easily distrust you   123.3170654367655
during the war with spain he was employed in the commissariat of the french army and made a fortune   109.58400367483638
now then go go in the name of heaven   114.93771610106585
so you have seen the arm that was all   53.53514045394472
positively   105.97943795793955
lord wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo   100.63255097792965
his father died poor despairing almost doubtful of providence   48.36846414863486
come my brother go with me added d artagnan and i will see that you are made a duke   95.3008453377189
but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love   113.37123579849651
i wish continued mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut   109.63292625488714
the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep   116.26486818684559
he will want a crown an el dorado and potosí   149.25348282194216
i hate you all but not equally   151.70081043367006
you must pardon him my lord said la ramee for i directed him to come   127.34635877947915
then d artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind constantly   108.19132306780091
it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason   157.0803435795568
but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten o clock   106.347953265641
what can we say to mazarin   127.42327561920467
i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me   159.33508077009841
but i swear to you by the memory of my brother whom i have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved   84.90965637430975
i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life   122.53184723127632
do you go and i will stay and take care of the wounded man   91.43903168212849
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house   170.14692821976337
he ill treated you then   83.1066555101827
but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response   199.21375137175943
asked morrel while d avrigny looked inquiringly   34.28079209287196
i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light   52.778648394535544
he is a proud soul he is a man by himself   106.28673675022313
but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage   112.12633769663016
it was indeed for him that they were there   48.15670627479095
lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all   104.00335479020688
he was discovered   126.47316290800468
i thank you gentlemen   127.43275375298039
i have told you to hope said the count   116.08912133032064
we were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a home   51.30800430700295
asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading   118.28413183073711
he is calling you said the count   79.76370657909817
fall voluntarily into my arms hypocritical and dangerous woman said d artagnan likewise to himself after having abused me with such effrontery and afterward i will laugh at you with him whom you wish me to kill   44.955890678060015
interrupted athos   140.78634852314218
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow   133.27948596555294
some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house   65.38008369925862
i was blind   97.82890718012993
i never thought of bringing you bad news   154.37231704598955
at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also   157.25974172035995
de villefort s antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name   112.32443169906854
that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here   134.26688972582795
gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone   123.08865145825676
believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon   139.5571960681363
and he extended his hands toward grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him   87.58654875562847
what did he say in the letter   116.12730436892059
it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near   183.80220890907668
explain it athos   98.25737909068127
madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles   51.92162282123754
danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die   151.37559786859757
suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it   82.98042631272799
it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant el kobbir   149.21445276665756
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornélie   141.92431316762335
peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch   138.34171895306818
for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin   241.0963513493706
what a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar   91.13602081495975
they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house   184.61992406540924
he said yes and he put his hand on his sword   81.24325815436416
charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king   51.53869207617987
i seemed to be going mad   143.30233223725284
and then to be here so young   158.7735771193988
as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinal s time   97.87434464780974
indeed often since misfortune has left me i have longed for the delights of an eternal sleep   37.147389082977355
noirtier and retired   135.95401410822996
well then family affairs perhaps   98.10992092425305
at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door   93.90947832714492
monseigneur said m   117.50548476103224
i come from the cardinal said the officer   198.1271938814398
over head and ears   100.97377321454344
the right of pardoning only applies to the guilty said tréville who was determined to have the last word and my musketeer is innocent   181.40102516479425
this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall   142.6737612079004
yes for time presses   179.8719075978737
and i forgot i had a daughter   67.64795893088714
when i say i will not do a thing i mean it   134.22022100611005
my friend said gondy you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man   161.8421311850382
we have only one monthyon prize   106.2828078469767
in fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the prince de condé had arrived   103.67358626026864
my darling   42.216145234476144
i am going down by the window in order to be there the sooner cried d artagnan   198.336039891865
grimaud followed athos   43.69768107662398
madame replied villefort you know that i am no hypocrite or at least that i never deceive without a reason   199.26883041257958
it will break my resolutions   91.06796633509983
said aramis to athos   133.43852560822552
madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should i not have returned by to morrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament   160.03807469020825
you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria   110.38354955868883
oh the devil   156.8414549135102
how did your father receive him albert   140.34417078526093
my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod   161.66765050736115
the very prosaic one of our landlord   116.67602740705053
as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage   101.69778680916117
at the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoner s brains with a pistol shot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the account   134.39153135961686
and listening discerned that they were cries of joy   195.83813698249196
you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough   71.51554057483987
he is pursued   147.91039743628232
there is porthos s purse too   80.6968693824115
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain   106.55285293597902
if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean   78.64917551350806
there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old   49.90722135318158
five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached cours la reine   150.47108670844082
what s the matter now   130.62171093097493
well i said d artagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot   65.46664049149351
the cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed   80.39395041104635
i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherd s life was vampa s reply   146.0699123364124
in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house   113.55552046163908
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours   73.13148756848085
can we count upon you   121.42670648666603
was the gascon determined to keep it as a weapon against milady or else let us be frank did he not reserve the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit   134.36938843170302
it seems to make one feverish and to raise one s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done   118.59057093247105
then you must suffer hunger   153.60879441130953
and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child   129.48821435405873
a mischance   81.54698445353725
i shall perhaps have something to say to you   158.36608120764538
therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said athos   68.02459107404054
i could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over me   129.5676691707093
said the dragoon   98.5015076542685
and he closed his eyes with a groan   134.73607466515028
madame bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted   81.34185489284448
but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done   174.2983931251149
no sire but i say that he deceives himself   70.61431224432562
we shall see said porthos majestically   127.31594037259282
he stopped at the door   162.22244342111154
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d épinay   167.8192198980323
de morcerf count said he you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care   58.35433987648878
and now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king   79.60061850983281
were you afraid raoul   125.74237174515436
he is well educated   92.01912780317437
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious   128.43148833343605
permit me then my dear athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to m   27.294889908064263
danglars dined with me   116.80554789853538
still another obstacle murmured mme   130.63224760726789
but d artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line   72.72364029830372
he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château d if that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès   152.5418676250398
it was useless to search at night and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning   55.9749497113509
perfectly well my good friend   125.68606608196333
in a second de guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage   116.85659776895467
a groan from barrois accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones attracted the attention of m   146.08919935926042
that is to say beauty meekness and tears and above all the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness the most devouring of all voluptuousness   102.74437519507418
it must be seen to be believed   219.59586195473915
if there s any fighting where i m going must i fight   122.33264787433643
the two arms fell with a sudden force   155.97652835145584
and now my good friend said d artagnan to him i must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak   122.09393931630737
put the army in battle array and face the enemy   148.3315454989586
but i arrived second and must sail first   163.44051434659522
inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor   145.2889147545834
the servant entered just as he had finished   119.65811383409165
the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting   105.32125496879164
they did not kill her and that s a comfort   108.9468513249585
i see you are covered with blood   83.31037235729858
but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first   109.9111527467005
let him follow me   91.4479884065259
the receiver started back   24.055350377186585
and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man   192.57419126990789
a few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered   65.82988945509362
flee alone   21.614833972442213
pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion   164.41383297330628
who asked for me   84.1762435365113
morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point   142.8411209682574
mademoiselle said eugénie let the porter get the post chaise from the coach house and fetch some post horses from the hotel   155.0032405500557
but to return to our millions   84.2184083535455
directly i have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at rue meslay no   3.0543742650439185
it is growing dark and there may be some mistake   175.99414985513525
arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar sausages   95.4027601680647
winter then left the tent   99.1136952970152
he was making rapid progress in italian   82.71968544017855
these verses were not excellent very far from it   151.42648096735354
and he burst into a hoarse laugh   107.72642404293305
i have seen him   140.67563888624267
come in gentlemen   114.55312847676466
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers   147.14350022513963
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success   79.0113582333195
you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty   133.68086780721632
but i can not accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already prepared   162.86585070515167
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival   157.08524142312683
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid   83.68719691158421
the traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of thomson french which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in rome   88.19272175392538
more worthy than any one in paris my dear friend   88.70836590562251
no part of the programme differed the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information   193.36054631793797
he knew that it was barren and without shelter   75.9713720985747
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression   71.05792267425853
when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it you will further say to him watch over his grace lord buckingham for they wish to assassinate him   102.92197702364119
ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a café on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julien and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes   129.7570060949998
this feeling lasted but for a moment   117.55727518112215
you have not guessed rightly   153.92078070369607
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugénie and the arrest of benedetto villefort having retired as well as noirtier and d avrigny her thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard   194.30242623640714
news in prison is a fruit so rare that i trust monsieur de comminges you will excuse my impatience the more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is good   156.52434728701206
you pity me little one   107.23147103218437
well let us see said mazarin   126.67194802344503
said the cardinal i know of whom you speak   78.68576683181462
i shall not do so   71.21242302271432
do you hear him valentine   142.86693942647474
the belfry of st   55.92067796056082
what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets   57.15619974725641
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle a stab with a knife for instance   97.2158076024093
do not think it will be less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor   146.49686980763042
he goes two or three times a week   131.96859190409612
but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education herself   103.32451285909914
faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus   138.4258337602816
there go two miscreants   50.679287268192155
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars   203.86174489207798
suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves   171.34276587220154
noirtier sent for the notary   96.15111779610358
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again   125.71634921744266
go said he   176.70419646709934
but too late by a minute unfortunate unfortunate that i am   140.55904344794547
you mean to say that he deceives me   138.68321900990037
cried the gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust   150.20817696596717
madame danglars trembled with fear   159.83958093543492
yes it was pronounced in my hearing once   181.24081136891198
you know albert women are singular creatures   142.40739196357185
would you like to know   41.79978479115137
asked the italian   91.26521245237122
in 1807 a month before i was arrested and a fortnight after the death of the count of spada on the 25th of december you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory i was reading for the thousandth time the papers i was arranging for the palace was sold to a stranger and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence intending to take with me twelve thousand francs i possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten my head dropped on my hands and i fell asleep about three o clock in the afternoon   49.79087939803104
doubtless i may but but   156.24148891260168
bernouin   123.37165649866407
and sir continued the wounded man i suffer much and would like if possible to be carried to some house   110.51714576772771
i heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king   127.39460213951565
ah why were you not there gentlemen   104.63917944407203
has he not already forgotten she ever existed   146.5990898513435
there were paintings by diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun   134.37527725076498
inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title   130.70953571907032
there must be plenty left replied d artagnan   120.61744748855466
then let us pray to heaven said the girl   85.47555850649042
i have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you all   108.7970485246906
as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing   112.75476012392457
in whose name do you come   52.173469745644994
she tried to go toward the window for air but she could only stretch forth her arms   92.17065667519644
you are today free as air come and dine with me   132.52464591438454
valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold   166.32603162364296
send at twelve said danglars smiling   36.07007692988786
we will not fire but at the last extremity   171.31732362166412
certes replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle   72.9031852743816
and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month   152.0631251899157
de villefort and then ask me for proofs   35.73308077835186
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me besides i may not be there myself   130.6848640776096
danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee   59.084962758900424
furious against the cardinal   71.32161831383127
and that if she has committed any follies i renounce her i abjure her i curse her   133.4623832404932
and what did you reply   57.55157016688043
the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted   135.1805597239826
this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son   108.49211710614992
the abbé busoni   114.7236008746342
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains   123.77921731846762
i don t comprehend   134.88160297739512
then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed ruined   90.52088129216563
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something   169.73915296173797
and where are we going may i ask without being too curious   129.30358952661544
but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty   116.380088394069
the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask   49.92436185559271
yes but by my marriage you have forwarded that   1.9736121691373825
he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter   139.92698197430698
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips   89.34526421143977
here comes a young gentleman said one of them who seems as if he were going to join the army   197.88653915827558
but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion   190.26362391481035
i could propose one to your majesty but i dare not   163.6576709543898
the officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets   109.03385880092351
noirtier how   173.55532001084504
and you are right my dear la ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was   100.35574139158788
pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a rope dancer   11.976690688777893
madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais   137.1138576189893
and have you replied to everyone as you have to me   23.672047338740555
this time it was not a host but a hostess who received him   78.23851377248305
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received   62.170188136739334
but having stopped to drink at a cabaret they had missed the carriage by ten minutes   52.077592736174196
the sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franz s mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness   72.90842243025614
question then my lord   115.81431931162399
at thirty five which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of france or england   163.28928661955354
for a moment dantès was speechless   72.57313653506382
he said two words to the chief and i was free   77.73492668437419
it was not i who wished to kill the jew said caderousse   104.57494996936074
are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god   54.93598793936159
the banker soon returned   112.12045929148442
have you then power against death   121.84413287963388
i will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens   136.65441964214904
at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop   141.33647100027682
he took the cross and kissed it   170.9945800752098
i dragged myself as far as the yard   46.95210030203852
upon reaching the room below i found five or six custom house officers and two or three gendarmes all heavily armed   109.25534827324327
amongst them the voyages of jean mocquet in the time of henry iv   121.62246409741466
bravo bravo   97.69192258336335
and have i any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there   12.35626790940671
i hate the english they are coarse like every nation that swills beer   88.63830611071053
when we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge   137.0262445476174
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity   71.30463534381542
i should be glad however to receive your excellency s commands concerning the dinner   92.72381781775539
it was a coupé of koller s building and with horses and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas   234.6204918025724
i know it cried d artagnan   77.83178004704678
aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion   152.755643004017
all this is vague enough   36.97191939880176
the air burned ignited by flaming embers then the frightful lightning disappeared the brands sank one after another into the abyss where they were extinguished and save for a slight vibration in the air after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened   124.68370677109527
i perceive what you are intending to propose to me   59.29687906936006
in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition   52.62052993715787
i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours   114.8017174517309
he reflected   134.5585843864781
i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent   129.62916189279812
do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal can not reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand   76.64682843572294
do not exaggerate your duty   95.53755186304141
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds   96.17876468621303
oh sir if you know who this man is cried d artagnan tell me who he is and whence he is   68.29123332890263
i will go myself   105.48952738973031
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres   114.56677503949824
d artagnan went to take leave of m   143.65167853249113
but for such a work you must have needed books had you any   173.35603035238563
i who had sacrificed for you the baronne de i know it well   161.25942025627447
he preferred to use the sitting room upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre   78.26074377435268
tomorrow at midday tréville   33.61299708471205
what then is it   181.3601235420576
instead of preaching about the torments of hell i talk of the joys of paradise   112.71925206723856
are you satisfied sir   155.91196516455042
but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love   179.44236574855444
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your grace   64.89942984815849
monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished   108.43733570516365
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing   81.63469044378837
julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance   164.29732736463637
we will accompany them only to a little village in limousin lying between tulle and angouleme a little village called roche l abeille   56.819410200416705
it was situated in a very private spot   153.12842491698913
but we are not superstitious   89.58167913617471
cried porthos making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of d artagnan who was wriggling about his back   131.47469371741724
rochefort s lackey would precede it as courier   121.34925238173608
yes he has just gone out   57.47648166654492
it is too long a time   79.8724778908954
for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe   75.9715724003657
the answer was terrible   60.24552400703161
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled   204.27713392714543
and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed he was able to provide for the wants of all for a fortnight   167.3888115997934
when the hour of breakfast came therefore i did not hesitate to eat and drink   128.76724919583882
on the contrary he came up to me and said it is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not i since he knows everything and i know nothing   123.79811016419997
cried he listen to me   58.0042880470565
franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the count   100.52910443626511
the count knows everything said the italian bowing   126.92912171002696
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river   110.7234088775605
the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat   134.944565993207
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s   120.34416496134837
the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour   181.65121738031425
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs   140.80069697536044
they are binding her   191.38450895799036
may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing m   241.59515727853392
as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her   96.99528006186908
you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general   10.60263901163276
colonel fairfax repeated bradshaw   69.446476746163
i wished no ill to morcerf   32.9999808283783
one of my friends   73.15451182911937
shall my father be informed of your wish   71.44470813285591
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away   122.17415192868542
but eugénie instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow   72.71683928407357
yes resolutely replied noirtier   105.52350836256691
my dear count you can not imagine how my mind is harassed   70.68185969351667
were the late cardinal richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the bastion saint gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole army   122.23994164921604
a thousand livres   53.589486718743146
it has succeeded since you deign to receive me   162.92559642041766
these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and franz could not consider them as game   61.97639447472785
noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing   38.981000010615006
milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure   119.21835046430719
and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves   78.623184953955
i will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account and which you will deliver into the proper hands   180.7429382722467
but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille   60.62975668532868
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just   118.85835473527283
de villefort s house   46.42029914634578
valentine smiled sadly   44.859183459447365
there is everything in a jesuit convent   118.10215425699302
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman   33.303599124131054
no monsieur returned monte cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends   98.64956707044288
i do not understand stammered lucien   155.24371843836974
my sole heir that i have bu   126.12571916831862
the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria   128.72711130670203
he cried falling back a step   172.82566404688853
the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal shaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin   154.61423477785434
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow   46.78772628709396
never i swear to you   104.47564127886268
yes everyone in my family is well   95.5806779094604
athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was painted   81.52024207565523
for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief   113.44056979615436
and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator   55.81005982942445
i come now to the last of the family whose secretary i was the count of spada   139.5535907906669
then replied mme   79.45032131058429
and i said aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that i will roast you at a slow fire like a savage   242.31253284060676
a family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal   51.89994191188125
quite so replied the lieutenant   160.91400957583556
repeated the faithful servant of anne of austria on his knees before the duke s sofa   78.12345394819945
then it is possible   129.6865496101266
if he is a puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens   70.54104191017832
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m   112.37018798035567
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois the only serving man whom he had left   132.15121549747855
d artagnan s penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost   74.35253109592915
yes most satisfactory my dear danglars   63.375881493443636
without that precaution valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured   101.65682836566307
come come tell me   133.1774325393111
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one   144.95715541406128
some lackey murmured d artagnan   38.81776688933353
yes said the count   116.02374607508976
do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving   92.27354975811845
nothing is concealed from the cardinal   99.57438054640734
you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you   68.30817578737978
go to the king s treasurer at blois   95.56282471728797
and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it   141.84059655038791
said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery   67.11573463884402
keep the lieutenancy my dear keep it   92.0282486724744
at length athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased   121.3579942293798
another horse   109.11207361933208
did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage   208.15540151334858
the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee   88.12160027744343
athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded him   62.81074691272573
the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of la jeune amélie   214.20799177241298
you must be gone   111.63089782822159
you are free my brothers   215.68367061417214
four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame   110.75474859189907
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris   63.613647449992996
well continued the count in a tone that made franz shudder this young gentleman is one of my friends this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself this young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger   89.23611993536046
40178m i am broken hearted said albert   153.71466114177073
but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do today   208.61435249966073
but at the third watched besides the guard and the doorkeepers the faithful bernouin a cerberus whom no speech could soften no wand even of gold could charm   111.61927827785576
cut the cable then   52.450315862938524
there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards   223.48524678903678
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime   83.67329902576927
i did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont   67.8683395415016
let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said aramis   174.5680292633873
lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets   161.4193020334371
do you then still hate those who separated you   134.33951016059828
and now good night   145.01368080192094
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill joined planks of the door   108.24729599073616
perceiving her brother in law she uttered a terrible cry   43.24133165212952
she had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity   108.00391265840143
employ me in any other way   132.06593031452522
but as this dream can not be realized since mademoiselle danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens me   117.37036498742582
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister   64.1554379257696
but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it   153.95286223968307
that gascon   53.229863950273156
as you please he said   145.193617365622
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry down with mazarin   57.68463337512555
these are my words exactly   121.4902505146356
these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect   159.24293689557516
the poor woman s head and arms fell   162.48589607916676
this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety   99.40180969693222
there is a dupe somewhere   131.03488967915263
asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life   109.70440835927553
and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to m   130.6220646328413
i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for mousqueton well agreed for a pretty mule said porthos   140.5613910947185
well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one   117.40433041727462
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff   121.24593148671818
and this time i come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other to say to you as god said to the first murderer cain what hast thou done to thy brother abel   48.338782831949985
he paused   182.2597458493504
they had besides to look constantly to their own proper safety   120.69899836143597
a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs élysées which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences   107.92865381374683
yes my pocket has a hole in it   176.456451064698
oh how i love you   71.54590800076292
oh it is not yet fixed   95.55876363232798
do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that i am very foolish to answer them   38.468190532903776
he was called count he was said to possess 50 000 livres per annum   180.5283521490395
unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn   54.6291338123333
porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play   119.56409389552213
the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered   175.85510890138102
monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded   123.71514247108361
then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips   95.86905894929613
at this instant they heard the sound of horses feet   114.16051617385756
he will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body   75.59063809948046
asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament   68.29511141251925
and d artagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in anne s hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty   120.46952099824038
we believe like mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said athos   156.89138552364153
very well sir said monte cristo   94.86743040814534
you will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity   50.985757619222156
the pretty mme   51.83156439969121
the three friends hastened toward d artagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse   98.63033159448092
asked the young girl in romaic of monte cristo   1.691856628980858
what could i do for you edmond besides pray and weep   125.93863945476734
well wait for the miracle i hope to accomplish or or   172.52964456027823
he perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister   140.48566399504818
ah said rochefort with a smile   57.18169792435017
but am i not your nearest relative   131.225962453179
london is far from paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers   117.280683108374
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke   154.4373560832427
on the contrary i have come to a decision   131.6965496577983
she ground her teeth   161.18448458310036
and the count humming an air from lucia went to sit down on a bench while bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts   86.22547655099933
if there is any left   86.90740337620042
they learned at a later period through mme   58.28840500577632
eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge   116.17963571414754
d artagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed   189.18287548008118
oh i am never cold you know   198.96302814568227
that is enough to drive away all my pains   106.2613734491962
all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard   63.8518538809639
but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me   183.62276927785166
nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends   94.55848120302974
neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it   142.08000420151916
yes the third   103.95078081996435
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person   220.8538578098906
at châlons i was put upon the saône thence i passed on to the rhône whence i descended merely with the current to arles   115.60419399038669
a complicated affair said porthos   161.40832397449475
he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue she a poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will she might at that very moment perhaps be preparing to die   206.07171464680732
it is you bernouin she said   60.679395968407974
i am not an abbé i am not mad   129.6418156991192
at this instant the door opened   128.01584346967985
and it is no secret that i owe my fortune such as it is to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief   131.32308372781316
has he been wounded then   106.65819145517109
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation   121.17074596008621
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man   59.05379008358274
in fact there is so much resemblance between us that i sometimes believe he is aramis and i am the coadjutor   90.11823611062734
noble heart   27.950213083762705
admirable sire   154.05370185706283
their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures   172.45100878212668
we have already wasted too much   178.56795155215784
this was murder in every sense of the word   72.90109026589064
the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night   173.39047084033348
you must be satan   61.56075666180569
listen hermine   130.99889637532772
the committee decided to hear the letter   171.43078006749982
he will never leave me   134.69638768831595
he is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous   140.5329172894186
but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage   108.6992482701852
make haste dear lodger said he   47.87128832730572
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to milady   35.09475154732358
of what country   142.08076586334695
she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier   153.8804729200597
we set forth on our journey   167.00393474914873
the day on which d artagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province   117.58395908632616
i have confidence in the remedy i propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy   93.8263036760697
and the evening came on slowly but finally it came   119.43304814841201
i i fence as well as you did in the old time better still perhaps   119.06511044427847
and so mademoiselle danglars she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel   92.37231882786648
long live broussel   21.241800965113327
didn t he speak of me in any way   154.30657733783642
the goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set calculated one with another what the diamonds were worth and without hesitation said fifteen hundred pistoles each my lord   158.3496353766128
poor king charles   88.3776866353652
so you were at the races baron   138.4060504489019
the bolts were drawn   73.02353213342573
our house added the englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way   98.7184827322859
that is to say each rested his head on the other s shoulder   121.70820718072002
in four days said morrel   87.81464984273371
and henry iv   130.6231091865585
what does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind at once implacable and generous   128.56396155225326
she can give blood in return for blood that is all   111.71779906845906
the two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable   87.42253176780241
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him   53.70733120087682
gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way   61.34390287272349
exclaimed d artagnan anxiously   34.372310042895464
albert rejoined his mother   94.51085134624662
i owe you the proofs and explanations of what i have said   170.67722110740152
all right said porthos   96.7245995076798
quite certain   114.94276409943481
on their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter dear wife we have now reached the moment of decision   138.35526796941082
the officer s face expressed complete stupefaction   60.80877134917966
haydée it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel   118.09175642423918
very sure   34.429122040225366
yes captain returned carlini   105.95800506200622
cried bonacieux in despair   177.08099335756532
valentine started   93.812950368509
edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead man s face   74.22403964944293
i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet   54.00352018996574
yes all   93.32918220685536
it was a quarter past midday   141.2567855382545
you no longer seem to understand me   147.4302456988855
julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel   136.81993960958224
carlini fetched two pickaxes   93.85071361214852
his mind was torn by doubt grief and despair   115.28227263305736
an admirable subject   121.0932766496701
it vexes me greatly continued athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for i am not yet at the end of my story   142.0167109208802
in the morning milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended her   122.5646004288684
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach   77.59796132808218
yes i understand perfectly said d artagnan   92.6852147481344
it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it   104.32986418732342
i won t have him killed i won t   108.68642202593212
his eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice dwelling upon every syllable dec   91.14993054760748
what is his birthplace   95.37117369904682
but for the sake of the mother   153.98644262678164
about forty leagues only   15.960528815079243
indeed as if de rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall   70.89535175232035
don t go d artagnan   82.279757678692
you a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman   77.59961545193916
asked his eminence   137.4592472887701
said d artagnan taking his friend by the hand   125.02228059450172
what could be his intentions towards him   73.17720936906215
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation s website and official page at www   124.31388432575518
i don t think so answered the other   170.84452456214805
to tear such clothes   137.51162498327022
what would you have my dear viscount   55.44865690427101
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction   159.002126286389
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father   72.34072751440797
thank you said luigi drawing back his hand   118.29439797068754
to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services   121.88839227086187
but don t attach any serious importance dear to what your father said   170.24761507995385
beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend   185.7563195583611
for my own part i have laid aside even the name of my father and altogether disown his political principles   187.8448675637889
how long you are before you tell me what i most wish to know   84.41385661560005
certainly it is empty replied the procurator s wife in real innocence   138.23149811202384
all goes well   145.3791300519493
and i also said morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon   96.31487036064715
20285m chapter 44   107.42878832971202
she ran to the table and seizing the knife which felton had laid down exclaimed and by what right will you prevent me from dying   202.0143964052507
there is a whole history connected with the names fernand and yanina   11.866055454807608
matrimonial projects the day following this scene at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office his coupé did not appear   131.7413029963846
alas they have taken everything   106.38289981154404
besides which the musketeer after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter first   134.18047681225207
that would be contrary to all custom   181.01405997778667
well it is a question of serving the king the gentleman s duty   101.8100476092045
yes but i make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works   81.3017942359609
i shall be with mine under the third   142.75627012383
alas your excellency is right replied bertuccio and god made this infant the instrument of our punishment   48.54488815615589
depart then depart i implore you   104.34208349506284
beyond the fortifications through which athos had made a breach in order to get out and which were composed of fagots planks and empty casks heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art they found swimming in puddles of oil and wine the bones and fragments of all the hams they had eaten   60.583957709652495
the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here   95.6208365864658
you hear sir   60.94097013993334
next moment the door opened and the man disappeared   59.106805371676636
de tréville waited for the king   107.32467625637567
d artagnan tried to recall his remembrances   122.8241207762269
say no more   119.18469944907342
they began the day he was sold   66.57296374362686
it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister   38.61101223649516
30301m meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf who standing before a mantle piece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a looking glass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him   80.42134644953614
and i said porthos shall make him my sole heir   133.30509873934048
now of two hundred and fifty one members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninety one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon   137.83661384738056
years have elapsed many events have happened alas   204.7192399058457
he passed on to another it also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full   48.5126843550386
kitty breathed a second sigh   87.76688559465038
when were you here   106.36735852260387
the treasure when dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found faria seated and looking composed   87.09594860513249
and he blew out the light   82.05660031759132
his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch   138.35889081514466
we are invited replied d artagnan to pass the night with m   96.78980703764849
wait my dear father said the young man one word more   109.85738847250886
but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus   45.528650416575275
i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm   75.31588721425524
haydée became pale and lifting her transparent hands to heaven exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears then you leave me my lord   76.14639266216213
five days are more than i require   100.79136850889878
when i tell you a thing sir said mordaunt you insult me by doubting it   63.22133784589805
against calumniators said m   91.5966719059133
but at present i must imitate the discretion of the doctor s niece   42.43904661363976
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty   138.74375871401796
adieu till then   156.49216221719962
but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them   79.82022820154057
so would i said porthos   100.88734055885361
ah maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both   123.62199832765552
of these 600 000 francs you took 50 000 crowns   137.0448236281793
an intervening elevation of land hid the light   81.6971813297132
as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks   100.50502737714041
and pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune   143.30289717432876
tell your client that although i am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as i am sure to gain   123.44338338831885
why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth   110.69130346109924
i am now quite at your service gentlemen said he   142.5064510240853
you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer   85.659875405138
go down athos he mistrusts you less than me and see if he be still at his door   27.18800890048196
that s it said d artagnan   118.23177204318338
why upon the frontiers of artois and of flanders   99.9268316665982
madame morrel looked again through the keyhole morrel was writing   118.6626061217308
they believe me her accomplice and will punish me with her   169.60026485247067
heaven would have given me strength   107.26867010943816
ah true i was writing   206.62140133674208
he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns   90.94224012056867
apropos   190.70933338454705
which d artagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following conversation   139.8289608241498
no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it   176.5871580916688
a shopkeeper in the rue des lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter   52.40019516417331
oh cried eugénie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine i deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me   34.64611561998824
albert attributed to franz s absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask   171.4027903133468
he was the son of a banker at lyons named particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to emery   153.47244747055066
he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny   77.9651125532477
he served in india discovered a mine in thessaly and comes to paris to establish a mineral water cure at auteuil   155.1436308190573
an unhappy prisoner replied dantès who made no hesitation in answering   46.83713442451949
laporte made no further objection and read my lord by that which since i have known you have suffered by you and for you i conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against france to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause   36.33535083802013
they had arrived in the champs élysées   49.8014255425437
here s to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and farther   146.77079835501894
amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a law court a case of real and genuine distress a drama of life   146.65160466435384
raise money with it and let your husband set out   105.15914419905388
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us   78.58728738676854
with grandpapa noirtier   127.38287150104958
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance   81.62911760354244
bonacieux who was ignorant that d artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m   102.58532042306382
but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone   120.69020373493792
you know he has estates porthos   100.71780106118794
talking of captain leclere has not dantès given you a letter from him   175.17739490663433
at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements   115.78570010747278
all is charming and everything savors of nobility replied d artagnan   185.04200918155925
do you remember me   106.29929776809806
does your eminence doubt my word   140.47931510376463
and on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me   98.07439480388373
i prefer that   88.58925015561631
near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands   79.23930068802946
oh maximilian how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness   168.51594008612125
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name   106.3155050853196
it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water   69.4129346349379
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands   138.23340725873456
she thinks of me then after five years of separation   77.95496194573835
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital   125.19251232225652
there was no doubt upon the subject   239.38426770150664
you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half filled with a red looking fluid   61.187217424024375
came into france i would offer him my house my own house   195.290387521924
i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat   197.23294107448908
who i am madame   158.4285032834768
it has hesitated at nothing in the past   127.75653571869174
in a moment sir answered dantès and i m with you   111.16729418909688
but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane   105.15875392073377
even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you can not well mistake him   97.3560290609361
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries   69.28955344264148
yes you are right maximilian i will follow you   84.6808028762355
there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate   156.5081967266422
you say this my dear boy   105.05604685741592
the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts   140.69551765901323
no one i tell you will escape   198.10993182827872
but you who are a reasonable being lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountain head surely you ought to prevent it said morcerf with a smile   102.81668957853643
the evening was employed in discussing the war   166.21514880688125
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captain s feet   115.84549944361336
grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence   131.62005175079577
true true cried danglars   89.90570147544659
did he take baptistin with him   162.92173228271764
and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth d artagnan s confidence stopped there   106.48195155828414
the fourth of 700 000 francs is 175 000 francs   160.50105583249143
with this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of d artagnan   147.53295650199988
it s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young cavalcanti whom i do not really know at all   198.58599306917222
monsieur cardinal you have heard me   183.9955270064708
dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers   136.46080973993202
the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and sausages   144.3525054569769
i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth   68.58810114692969
de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint méran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles   104.61985322265741
he whispered to porthos as they proceeded   85.35637655176951
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation   143.50521835171548
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never   213.53441387105016
what is the next   127.35261426209064
with the greatest care   129.4515765874932
and has he conformed to all that the letter specified   110.06392525320675
in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them   79.01787839063698
in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st   64.46479291711715
i don t suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself   134.77884412074621
bonacieux holding out her hand to him and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall   139.19991967757863
i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter s hand   92.16448253401654
i will run to monsieur de tréville to tell them all this and will meet them there   140.43436134761532
but however near it may be replied d artagnan i can not go thither in this guise   153.2713176410404
i shall be back in ten minutes   154.87657713682168
fortunately by our marriage contract the survivor takes everything   34.91745159658018
by you   36.256979794714326
oh dear yes   122.03109775653861
that will be useless   143.7845330247286
nothing but intrigues   60.93464512024371
i think only that i have known you not a whole year   89.90532996829668
does your excellency wish for a receipt   230.00354459995572
as they stopped at the door of the cardinal s study d artagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his shoulder   146.47458500325172
you will speak first and tell him that i am gone on the lookout because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe   113.34709248681907
i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above another s   180.85778072712372
but on gaining the riverside he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his passage   107.64161115053452
50123m yes i think i saw him pass   163.3325030946082
bayard   143.83527902684074
it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience   126.1240526930236
just to please me albert said mercédès   144.84038447010914
said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects   134.03554518498404
to the devil   45.269583195650725
but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde   78.12042486334141
i speak of the prop of the state of my only servant of my only friend of the cardinal   105.00247776173313
bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the louvre   114.22248504263352
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind   79.6030789985611
madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you   97.04988980091355
and by what   190.80565158118472
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other   111.95848963988672
tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreuse he may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful   225.15428531822175
with respect to aramis though having the air of having nothing secret about him he was a young fellow made up of mysteries answering little to questions put to him about others and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a princess wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor   79.23190276327352
here i am   92.70843010484874
then there is no revenge   120.775684925414
the woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her   153.71597406689466
of what nature   125.69848614772972
your true father   200.61459868446394
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy   157.18134538935053
i only ate some fruit   103.54393433302822
for heaven s sake don t be obstinate for when others are obstinate i am obstinate likewise and then i become ferocious and headstrong and there s my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself   100.17788824098984
the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead   121.9318581816038
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos   172.51835394960216
you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the marchioness   82.33630856867516
and at this moment albert had nothing more transpired your father s cause had been gained   151.50586613824836
then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open ledger   117.43551032307991
he was a shepherd boy attached to the farm of the count of san felice situated between palestrina and the lake of gabri   128.51734200192934
she joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a word   137.96882063500624
war between england and france was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carousal   82.67258310540802
felton had not spoken   81.85417751894366
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around   126.0667003228138
yes yes said caderousse   147.5427021541094
my good friend said albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not   90.83283901353404
it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face   103.92462827597903
my poor girl in ten years i shall be old and you will be still young   69.60719193781277
it was empty and dantès emerged from the tunnel   27.7639949129871
at the end of half an hour or thereabouts a clerk came to put an end to his tortures but not to his anxiety by giving the order to conduct m   143.98506357145715
said the fair frail girl to her brunette companion   103.97954398608134
oh by the way you d better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the chat qui pelote   140.60591524188726
we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion   125.47200884479199
so i took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then i jumped after him   142.52851566196586
cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive   98.74606993548505
more closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed her   134.5678166123319
go and call out your regiment said he   121.27155634908486
never a mistake or delay a fellow who paid like a prince   133.35770275056746
and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks   157.4333823906279
thanks thanks dear love adieu   115.6823307154081
a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room   64.92853142529665
i must wait   93.50389193099208
what do you think aramis   50.85315989738989
asked monte cristo in the same tone that louis xiv   54.69339997592945
in what part of the house   126.80801017386116
it gives you an idea of your value   163.06436209240883
what prevents you from being so   45.72248313556781
not only free but in favor   77.80983783648898
however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m   114.26185634227993
when he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening looks   113.03981669488128
who are those gentlemen   54.17553694433883
and the duke smiled with a smile at once sad and charming   77.45570754715453
we are about to ascertain sire replied d artagnan as he rapidly left the room   136.43541630141027
have you been satisfied with him this voyage   127.3721913251633
i recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me while i managed to stammer forth i did not do it   95.22890479002069
it contained monte cristo   123.83180292373875
benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains   152.47665286332966
30 the miser in molière s comedy of l avare   171.37714048315743
cloud sounded half past ten   101.15377786187359
since i have the good fortune to meet you i beg you to receive them and to hold me always as one of your friends   104.65814872312714
the agent of thomson french had not been again seen at marseilles   143.0509806107806
my life was in constant danger   128.54263309925568
from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door   209.76183474994883
and he set off running as if the devil possessed him hoping that he might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carried him far   131.06393527972386
for i know what it is to be in love   125.76162697432406
having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the allées de meilhan belonged dantès next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth   134.40274903068456
dressed with the greatest elegance and who wore the order of the holy ghost   23.90851522292658
swear to me replied faria to free me if what i tell you prove true and i will stay here while you go to the spot   139.66533383294677
athos turned red with rage   99.59104950207207
i was for twenty years cardinal spada s secretary   68.88753737071555
the queen entered the great hall   106.62759713989756
there is peril of imprisonment risk of life in knowing me   76.65373315471888
to morrow i am on guard   104.71009990435911
but he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second than for fear he should make a third he is struck down   112.4074310193016
the trumpets sounded   103.60621942485251
a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour   75.76620338520833
de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously   189.00251610901864
the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken   148.8362190624305
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand   77.61674414468581
you say either too much or too little   80.01734247325145
dantès continued his search   104.45530883695338
and you are not afraid of that athos   153.38803141659992
but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt   45.43896852632837
then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room   99.39472245043801
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage   104.34851061735972
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourself whom he considered the first three personages in france   94.95779790527274
here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain   66.11889591699654
you will i hope be grateful for it   34.427422780041084
oh no never mind that said the italian   108.42968572539571
well asked franz what think you of the count of monte cristo   132.0696045530818
his eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tiger cat he advanced toward the hedge   52.93899823452781
whatever you say   163.99347415836166
i know that i must have been mad senseless to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm   223.44631239124374
before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs   177.97407233587063
how did you know i was in prison   87.12569615602494
and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the allées de meilhan was obtained   126.51197227341784
and at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode   88.89931553353159
and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it   91.08554136692443
besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me   98.34028831120277
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four   13.261436278361629
the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other   181.72069032672113
d artagnan called the sergeant   161.05920519096858
so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again   147.3357285742733
not one   137.61950828156344
the decanter and the glass were completely empty   144.97124542024773
but not with men   170.9842895968646
exclaimed emmanuel   103.99768689311752
a police agent entered   104.11382569903965
well we shall see   99.25433971961985
said madame de villefort   51.83606065983304
you have a daughter then madame   65.83835231563368
yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me   125.6090634848033
and if i deceive you bring me here again i ask no more   142.78286677671923
what man   110.52622651936306
answered d artagnan   120.13104962172383
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded   116.24302471699333
ah a window   134.78643958663292
i was speaking of your father s past history   63.77083864458545
i am yet living   110.75447014584917
the poor girl ventured a glance at d artagnan which said see how i suffer on your account   239.51519243006499
great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means   164.3750973606658
we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and i to mine   118.88770244160399
dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on end   113.90063342276962
he was less stiff than formerly   101.31641467629554
but i thought this mark of consideration due to you   133.71854076849272
he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred   181.4617946821256
oh how he will thank you   153.11459368407694
but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor   282.45068396758114
if you succeed with him i pronounce you the demon himself   123.54392997149213
i only brought you here to ask you returned mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers   144.00994771632605
and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair   142.41704360729403
oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes   95.17920082531737
i have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping albert on the steps   151.9417824100128
my valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out   218.47484327421114
said busoni disdainfully   79.68340495496966
i swear i will not   65.46899771911544
now said morrel do you wish me to retire   99.22878565535513
but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner   162.67744600326753
said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day grisier comes to my house   132.57154051449277
morrel started   178.0177048017265
that was something   156.43939473559038
are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name   153.047654151658
do you know who this pretended duchess is   126.32525298828025
i wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself myself and a third person   83.45145586094836
your home is a paradise porthos   115.9144664655398
the two friends looked to the right to the left   82.37898958534828
come cheer up   149.63120411901187
do you see madame he recognizes you and bows   52.74781599402124
for i have such a delightful note on the pastor quum traheret wait and i will listen to you afterwards   117.29590803866535
what has happened to you my lord   170.20937341673303
the iron box was there no one had touched it under a beautiful fig tree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot   97.6771808806819
denis a strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate results   60.85713389736793
three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded   215.1134752480827
noirtier s happiness i   100.40510244907907
he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to his protégé   61.65370657914667
frankly and loyally repeated milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity   96.93158141228598
behind this wall   128.87955653427483
you are late   151.37032249466705
but said albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel   122.83972135517583
whatever may happen valentine do not be alarmed   109.66154904138634
monsieur de belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there   98.81323906046556
as you execute you will understand   97.07699521537805
but from whom is that letter   190.6227540079568
then demanded athos   148.837257965634
the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm   121.4534725313553
i forgot said athos laughing   56.36904320875149
what do you want you strumpet   121.66126088255524
five hundred pistoles   93.44934373038808
the only thing is to understand it   145.66794774193994
are they capable of attempting violence   109.36156318120989
in that case adieu   69.20001315645541
was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger   157.90702212341824
decidedly   5.940472014506085
cried the young man turning pale   141.22592088502762
madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event   83.62793879983492
the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards   56.65106917242391
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded   115.48588209116254
he then formed a resolution   112.07720034287509
mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother s room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with m   84.58949704679009
and without listening to villefort he arose and followed valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to   237.99802522044013
danglars conceals at least half of his fortune   79.8436917135725
but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day   67.97729396271671
17 the genoese conspirator   162.32049312059513
well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from madame de morcerf s   140.139999359316
really sir d artagnan said to him i am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue   92.50047343242535
the notary here descended and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone   92.4980456602561
to wait   185.53756429165685
dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him   167.69056299380003
where are your passports   20.148540805321048
it is monsieur d artagnan   77.22553688727163
you can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebody s head   57.76089371330853
this voice the sound of which reached d artagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten   99.60230819341089
and then moreover what could happen to him   95.70172002502198
from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of germain pillon s graces 23 but the fore arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed   190.08661121288168
and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out return to my hôtel for it will be useless for you to wait for me longer   109.64422628874482
d artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many rochellais   117.02221135618905
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first time   46.06257166031885
we shall not be safe till we have seen mazarin and then the devil   122.46036815793784
at nine o clock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or milady pronouncing a single word   89.3008729853991
then disguised in the clothes of the marquis d o he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door   110.25825203080372
40272m and do you know said valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house   122.55163806981368
then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred   113.52471808445551
let us follow him said de guiche   201.38610292877283
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years   73.75270042792356
on hearing the password germain bowed   72.59581158626183
having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dantès the latter of whom attracted universal notice   172.41748781045735
the abbé threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face   121.28581884654744
by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive   76.4750800910577
mazarin read and construed that smile   93.4018626820837
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself   96.97704319123466
he entered the marshal s apartment while i was there   152.0219937418466
perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel   136.18302853599093
what do i think   22.190277010598308
i am well furnished with such playthings   124.38289897648109
i can go no farther   114.76372082892345
and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers   157.63254676047498
i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception   97.6592845544996
if i am happy in an error do not have the cruelty to lift me from it   92.00053175386516
when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear   119.33030963672535
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot   76.93203632098363
really how very amusing   164.89120546266605
père pamphile had seen dantès pass not ten minutes before   201.90837221717084
still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month   166.83977431472795
asked a gendarme   222.61389834647704
the others my lord   27.891910634036265
wrapped in this sweet idea d artagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment   105.11523213561503
you mistake sir said morcerf with a gloomy smile   112.92003340598461
noirtier s breathing came thick and short   37.57396448292319
and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament   97.28652645889808
but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side   76.75476057794508
oh see maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you   111.63536753618024
the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of mercédès   83.26285801631653
you are accused of treason of abuse of power and murder   126.07745763825034
athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger   38.78254234997031
yes tis too true said comminges tis almost a prison   81.4912564983017
no sire but to buy your majesty   64.83237859500923
why you strike like a blind or a deaf man   148.20921533106966
he sees no one but the king   89.60965760622365
that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari   110.46749565310017
he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered   40.87455961244689
his person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress   114.88790479819872
oh no self love beauchamp   80.9553286175797
what spot   45.64223378602472
he could say no more   28.23595228083579
the banker accompanied him to the door   161.3270902611589
chapter 92   75.94916139181268
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed d artagnan aside with his hand   120.27329147870739
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert   38.27141163864971
yes the enemy   167.2698595731667
on seeing him d artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise   130.4171371871417
these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them this is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy   42.23059585041794
at the end of two hours as porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their journey   148.09719295975015
therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place   109.887721572487
no my lord and i will set out at once   75.96653697312877
that is sufficient   122.10321886033262
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking it it was the noise of cannon   163.9694234209827
i can see nothing but his back resumed grimaud   160.89671449353347
now my fault is repaired   177.21067580775275
gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking   85.25900106000216
if you do not come across one return for me   143.4618578437512
yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water   142.49876070866995
my only regret is not having seen d artagnan   146.762038677211
oh you are so kind and i am so grateful   142.5711424819285
drink this and then take nothing more tonight   133.14259928071326
the count bowed and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention   177.04946293324468
monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the post   106.19323019989521
take my advice renounce this woman   76.47503063839795
his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue   130.1777645963553
morrel had passed many an anxious hour   35.17049174759197
ah the traitor   88.73306498430561
pistache my friend jump for the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina   116.69784254260333
four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two o clock in the morning all the cargo was out of la jeune amélie and on terra firma   113.13238175745754
as for the count he just touched the dishes   122.95868347452833
and god grant that this woman who has scarcely entered into your life may not leave a terrible trace in it   119.1071302822267
marry forsooth people don t die of hunger here   119.04861991776517
he aspires to the hand of the proud eugénie   124.66926780249354
felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones   193.99915783129126
morrel good worthy man said caderousse   173.71793266914352
and who cares now about yanina which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823   130.61605061457558
the king looked at the three gentlemen   155.69639817361747
it is in fact magnificent said andrea   134.8451526305
at all events said milady seriously he has deceived me and from the moment he deceived me he merited death   64.13256952661926
copyright law   110.83187406968574
you evidently know her   175.7176799052713
i will profit by the advice   154.96333502141212
40070m from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass   113.12431426448414
he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majesty s command   89.30648962048556
how curious   155.6547147214614
che cosa   218.65575279678148
so you may plainly see tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked   47.45006267898414
then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen   101.10623362968289
none monsieur   164.91527399823082
because my lord said haydée eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness   21.63413842884063
entirely so my dear d artagnan   128.00206902865548
i confess i began to be very uneasy on your account   81.99222950765017
the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his office   60.90297721459923
in two or three hours thought dantès the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm   66.89755913110186
let us dispense with useless words   89.9861735906412
everything will come to us when wanted   70.61706449403877
the young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his lips   150.85492056822173
i did not say that i feared it   118.56308138730579
here said milady rising with the majesty of a queen here felton behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl the victim of the brutality of a villain   198.9354151111737
are you going to drown me   102.37733800137431
i told him you were gone out and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter which he had brought with him already sealed   152.63824103083203
we conceal ourselves and wait together   55.54497210994845
my friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his will for he was master   63.7178723918264
and you have i am sure the fullest confidence in my honor   91.81415462612202
you have seen him   120.23247575543998
swear what   185.0766592601276
yes there were some people on the way who delayed me   55.341872815127346
as to d artagnan he took care not to give the least sign of existence   165.0639000236338
as he alighted comminges approached him   116.62870090434959
my dear d herblay   43.245060614525755
for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition   160.9351016416657
faria saw this   173.76153051605127
one of your friends   93.27567438796116
his first and most indelible recollections were there   92.25170476976209
and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out   158.44749231467583
don t let us talk politics my lord   44.789593963165245
villefort rang   103.29975401101483
yes stammered the old man   144.2188183404043
however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone   159.25606874478513
ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss   116.94694953101033
must this last formality take place in your presence sir   58.90423218578931
i ask if you are certain of it   231.87063723378753
replied albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which monte cristo did not lose sight of   148.0592061307829
well said milady i have not seen our gascon this evening   144.8213155501282
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss   122.72913718577105
listen it is impossible   117.27184156873192
cried out winter   197.44501096235535
because in truth albert you hesitate   131.23123442383982
i bear that of your brother   162.21028870784332
asked aramis half hidden by the window curtain   144.261017990873
my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance   114.41321384464602
ask her said morrel translating noirtier s thought this time by his look   72.02646713971355
yes madame here i have a right to do so for it concerns monsieur d artagnan d artagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman   5.2185246475135045
let us lose no time   155.58204935923675
now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may   11.28134681619764
i go at once   173.51133987832037
those lips were magnificent   95.01432294558053
the cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders   109.59375523366174
noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result   89.50002625111159
porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee   161.05241794327532
inquired the steward   111.66719108593811
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other   186.42160871246014
meanwhile lord de winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of buckingham s household had all made their way into the chamber   117.18064310236606
athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to withdraw   71.97168662434353
bonacieux made no reply   119.56086060309484
he said at last   115.76596222199126
i had not dared to sleep a single instant   144.75283214617187
bertuccio alone turned pale whenever benedetto s name was mentioned in his presence but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so   191.53029177461832
well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach   150.88882885328604
are we not going   128.8954416377517
asked emmanuel   160.5265938711571
let me see it said milady   97.74089469460951
and as soon as the siege of la rochelle is terminated i promise you on my part good cried athos good   120.7750370067294
but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view   202.5344342770126
and here is the second   124.17873356472829
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits   50.20414539561742
perfectly just cried the other two guardsmen the judgment of king solomon   166.3458560519704
the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney   121.47390574799817
but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility while the prince de conti the duc de beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of france   182.8343792054195
what would your excellency like   141.633780558077
but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord   112.26763951836404
my lord he asked where does your eminence wish monsieur comte de la fere to be lodged   125.75182831493049
and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance   52.732576261915256
what no wine   151.69554716938646
why dramatic   116.50234632839856
he can he says only swim in rivers   130.67338133473316
but what name can you give it what name will the lord give it if i am innocent   67.08012936689157
besides be assured my dear edmond the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty   195.95152418543836
then we are once more reunited   87.8146007022015
why did you not come down to breakfast   75.86864951384571
i learn all in the silence of my apartments for instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music   75.0767397250427
don t speak of marseilles i beg of you maximilian   85.2307755207683
to no one   85.87430389635152
inquired the unknown   62.72993736442135
d artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well   143.8929451335999
pardon madame he said i am not a lawyer i am a mere soldier and probably therefore i do not quite comprehend the value of certain words   62.37443001322345
if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments   108.26667524856097
were consumed or nearly so he commenced complaints which athos thought nauseous porthos indecent and aramis ridiculous   121.46052292482021
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall until at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du périer   114.06168395190011
if i take you you will be hung   66.85079390778503
bravo porthos   55.38109795269166
the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely   142.41830927779844
milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to her   165.261721630917
on the morrow at three o clock in the afternoon they arrived at surgères   138.15885262269938
i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france   89.43324985665147
at this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall   46.94554866140939
in one case or the other the trial was soon over   174.6495497604886
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me   193.5448665893334
and if you move i will blow your brains out   109.28354898451569
asked caderousse in a choking voice   118.39227979818321
i do indeed   53.968556416623386
what is his bearing   101.29499428831625
the king s closet at the tuileries chapter 11   79.40502745515874
i have full and perfect confidence in him   144.38900237097192
as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear d herblay   165.25269558285572
andrea the murderer   138.53199714061898
no he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket and took from it a paper folded in four and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential he said good   51.88778252209389
oh nothing more easy   79.35463964849271
allow me then to avoid dishonor by death   148.52695711381264
an adventure on the high road   107.93203916610817
but why do you ask   127.8266367212121
this is the second or third time monsieur that you have repeated that name and yet i have told you that i do not know him   93.13137500275954
well then i will tell you what we must do   80.30310952358755
i am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length   43.14095667872624
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber   118.66397223019038
if you are young i will be your comrade   112.882574077159
well replied mercédès sighing go albert   83.15510571335932
in the course of the forenoon monsieur de beaufort had a game of tennis with la ramee   126.40068156210737
well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required   163.91340826490193
50205m these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement   70.74989862504813
he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy   39.12228532093586
and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo   2.276804743723048
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened   85.9948425305194
the duc de beaufort drew his sword   138.50385161939442
so much the more reason   125.91449939195533
then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity   131.8404200929283
but where and how shall i see you again   139.16653548650888
you know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs   139.95658921466432
i wouldn t give a farthing for his life   79.63505592197842
he had sighed deeply therefore when accepting the gift of the pony from m   109.50825966642014
then d artagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knows d artagnan was not a millionaire   84.9440491060407
but under what circumstances   171.78136589837493
the clerk continued to write for the next five minutes   50.776810541738655
excellency the frenchman s carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa   83.16709942979841
but yet i do live   113.12822934570177
and where do you come from   175.34912279176592
they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word   126.2890222994414
and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor   145.53068985097028
come guitant speak if you please respectfully of these gentlemen said mazarin   35.35979788471191
and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us   121.14616945543972
repeated anne   72.33413818701706
rise said the count your life is safe   112.76287326315904
mazarin went to the right hand and aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue   97.26463180274433
and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join maximilian   74.99690724562794
what is there astonishing in that   37.17883668050803
joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow   140.92230214471917
the one in the dark blue coat   49.03184468274458
there is no crime in my house   83.47134457604687
on the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour   12.347304501689862
then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwell s letter   76.47288870257856
aramis is one of my best friends   175.16650411416634
ah it is you my lord   200.1647689860191
i thought my body was my own and that i might sell it   132.1863433658179
never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me   101.18629626418736
if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view   107.48460935601008
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten   48.34584738703403
besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you like we can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our oars   140.17927539086926
and if you grant it me i will bless you in this world and in the next   118.18351680585143
at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his grace s most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer   115.18630552329505
i recall to you that word   175.36094256611847
that was the question the three musketeers put to one another   96.47780141794817
i am credited on you for six millions   146.82136092650262
oh save me   129.92707677256143
he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles   69.32528870532781
so then   160.3686157762752
and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief   102.68194626349624
now through this ventilating hole i throw my lasso and as i now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine that s my point for sport   178.06960036451815
it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer   99.89815299340162
cried d artagnan athos what has become of athos   140.18714016602053
cried charles juxon thank you my last friend   76.20269380979693
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say   61.3104230390013
when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed   96.49150452128076
aha said groslow   78.73063797670204
maximilian shuddered   109.87997776969871
only imagine my dear friend   196.9887013682154
i only know it says thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s goods nor yet his wife   91.39933864255644
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal   108.04943862150634
in receiving and aiding him france will censure the acts of the english nation and thus so essentially harm england and especially the well being of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities   15.793261791862236
40160m oh reverend sir   35.21092008433233
well asked the abbé as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do   128.24676675811816
but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found he flew for the third time into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine oil and rosemary for upon seeing this hot headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found the host seized a spit his wife a broom handle and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before   104.74995659045071
that s all plain enough   193.81634809585717
see here it is   184.43343737979896
monsieur de beaufort escaped   134.2923704984744
i am bored amuse me   180.35227569136822
her second glance was at the dying man   123.37033353948763
the monk s eye again flashed but that was all   83.35144222879435
they then left the hotel athos carrying a saw porthos a vise aramis an axe and d artagnan a hammer and some nails   93.91643968512477
as edmond paused the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at the door   132.65848295952298
noirtier playing with revolutions m   86.4234236310323
50145m you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven   108.18090869455625
that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for me   59.99404558036855
said mercédès in a tremulous voice   147.70896719401563
he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps   149.36975783902056
i expected thee said the bandit to rita s father   71.17327578132011
it is miserable do you see   129.6659142684841
i receive him among the number of my friends   95.6025746240495
edmond thought he was in a dream he wavered between incredulity and joy   92.68881886591248
replied the baron negligently   53.093043444600454
that confirms what i said just now blood will have blood   135.8662188074262
and when can i see this young lady for whom i already feel so great a sympathy   37.460208833123374
i do not jest said athos   169.0076230285434
he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of   194.81744571502406
i require my lord that normandy should be given to madame de longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution   185.13110469120315
grimaud made the sign yes   131.0543872935371
after quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided   114.14680716847828
a conjugal scene as athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down   82.76414632915089
villefort had calculated rightly   165.12203937108515
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello   133.39929641198407
but monsieur de tréville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight   210.92049024822109
murmured she   83.72742712132344
you must set out for boulogne   106.80210831189001
the officer seemed a statue   148.08584574737628
said milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to destroy   57.77891549124145
then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and study   6.096471261706512
alas said d artagnan it is because i am the most unfortunate   7.382835691563756
when i speak of the pure parliament resumed the host i mean the one which colonel bridge has weeded   55.42842577596321
it is a fire   79.69007871650942
my first impressions were favorable to the minister   129.8831033132994
the queen was as we have said of great beauty   111.70081094656715
the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal   120.28934212525115
they had reached the ladder which led to the boat   86.49459649360628
he did not know a word of english   69.7639550646565
died poisoned you know by what mistake   158.79689107896638
how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry   52.5300735724027
i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and can not in the least make out what it is about   159.34957875733693
for our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers   194.89466935145356
you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing   100.33025533109716
on shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak   66.79448281541745
the figures were defined like black shadows on the red tinted horizon   151.7357373177942
d épinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m   136.20720663013088
these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor renée   52.992838762205444
then it is because you do not know your friends my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat   155.32087558599628
you can not make me believe that   98.7720743652603
they will have nothing to do then at this end   75.07632457025508
milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him   34.64218417079634
i am an old soldier of rocroy my lord   80.05919980873286
oh my mother it was you who said you were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen   112.15346850014791
his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said julie   87.85395642003449
he admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of porthos   108.61753255751955
it is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of madame de longueville   59.61997364779824
all this is very extraordinary said château renaud   71.9150512483523
the englishman calculated fast   119.25761509415497
the french fight well   133.05311041638174
he s my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him   51.156086287605504
quite quite alone replied the man or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing   109.71663592038847
now if you will come on board m   79.105633206109
and our masters   114.76819777552038
excellency said pastrini i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that i came   84.79715102806612
look added he   24.116211463340917
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majesty s voice and await the order of their captain   83.47501201719
then said aramis i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her   125.17905616411889
he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell   100.6301428162496
sometimes grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the contrary   55.466562600902016
he muttered whence comes this thought   152.14942974851652
all the details of his coming into and going out of the palace on the night when he introduced himself in the character of an italian fortune teller you will tell him that he may not doubt the correctness of my information   200.38341650351242
have i not explained your wishes grandpapa   109.94311148959191
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me i had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant   158.03241920794224
and what is her name   199.77778182381536
the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence   149.3445334597244
tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right hand correspondent was telegraphing i should not see him   185.36955451191454
and a threatening glance darted from her eyes   98.00911915155584
and what do you suspect   75.1984936847281
but is he really a prince   93.05616599619243
i will try and gain a little sleep for you are saved   70.97859686406869
at this moment planchet brought out athos s horse   59.41646852424735
well three days after that you talked politics with m   64.80060018983042
for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said athos   101.1456253638091
as the night before d artagnan did not return home till five o clock in the morning   99.99116026580593
in the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably   93.56689890381128
no wounded his horse only   171.91837937208794
the will   157.60989683767352
not without my defending it said groslow   45.5490933393848
henry iv   139.6573910517205
exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says himself   143.005552347025
that s it said the tutor   172.95585126478306
the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your child s birth   79.72053202516457
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner   76.82528060899317
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished   75.27467362164944
villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head   80.12943654109691
if i want money i can send for some to any of my chateaux   150.6790964854061
this was the room appropriated to the sailors   164.67422443469002
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty   87.07136163687471
holloa there some bread   14.235723111992371
but for you in the words of the gospel seek and you shall find   95.86451819938557
as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty   64.16393204284067
was not that nearly what you said   81.09824440455563
what does you mean by boor michon   221.94008921787673
and he had hastened to saint germain to warn the queen of that disappearance   148.68330268373245
he is a glutton   97.44706314767856
yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards   182.4805062761742
mademoiselle danglars was still the same cold beautiful and satirical   93.77498608497446
yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m   62.873272700536
de villefort s pardon   158.67495660058972
poor devil   124.7017462849092
the ghost of former greatness   130.53014987256694
to quote some latin verses i have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and i am a valley dear rochefort one of the lowliest of the low   100.17596426393054
it is the work of another age constructed by the genii of earth and water   111.7196240691321
ah my lord if i mistake not the chevalier d artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards   96.478710814762
bonacieux retired   65.34047879675416
rue de la harpe   92.93038212966025
but does he not approach the walls while playing   119.67742192978342
but his confidence in grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance   146.10397576364892
you do not sanction our project   158.53041676479046
the count has an unlimited credit upon me   93.01073624265074
but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england   59.38681505105605
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk   74.82827272361064
are you fond of horses count   127.55540199596183
they locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the day   137.04719427902967
but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited   138.95922311567796
chapter 105   14.697841471415629
now look here i want something to eat   176.40638061752747
who said valentine was dead   153.41124662682606
this woman was now his whole thought his whole soul   136.34605604797085
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door   7.706074254352259
but i give you leave to try them upon this one   148.71527660097075
probably said d artagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to whitehall with three of his friends   85.9226637931763
and the travelers continued their route   100.5800106738042
but enough of money matters   153.45654862903797
there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco known from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakia was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond   101.04283323958393
it was you who sent for me   98.81860435694375
it was indeed planchet and grimaud   86.52744138325785
at the louvre   60.05159113510654
milady uttered a stifled groan   45.85602943572846
that poor planchet   103.52232509389815
all this savors of his eminence a league off   21.61955080553099
but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing   91.05863571110689
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter   165.72826966717315
you really wish to see her   79.18881725184127
is life worth the trouble of so many questions   123.86721797898154
they returned to the hotel   138.52962838406214
and sir where does he reside pray   98.99020234729763
but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention   183.383500808678
of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile   70.42943035501405
nor i said athos   203.22215079814035
monte cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart   222.3658061530361
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper   141.50362129266014
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me   55.48062598067559
all the same resumed he after having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows   120.9506968081245
i cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead   85.02327133823442
as d artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m   90.06213476442497
think what a solemn engagement you are making   84.74717290725214
it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you   78.39278987238933
i come in the name of our master ali tepelini   108.1084483057217
andrea shrugged his shoulders   162.4823569373167
have you sir asked he a letter accrediting you to me   116.63600807875711
i quote a fact that is all   157.56500564104886
this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey   133.29874105164663
monsieur porthos said she i can assure you that you have severely punished me   102.84471281626939
the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation   180.09140994647706
mazarin listened intently   115.51413770280321
well that is not impossible   156.52293860492057
parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep   69.34703329384108
she called the maid and questioned her   43.86310674457863
can you enlighten me on that point   125.82099322386014
you confess it   122.13420943811406
but would you ruin me   160.00071186590094
the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph   137.13964297397382
but how am i to act   108.39693650313139
would you not trust the cavalcanti   92.88627289426223
then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to laporte try my dear laporte to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal to whom both he and i are under such important obligations   100.80132407634
the rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace   117.72621193764321
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar   64.82876549425904
charles had heard and understood it all   152.55664702903647
he broke it   175.17816108494466
the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o clock but perhaps valentine will not wait for that   112.40420735176819
they gave them three hours rest and then set off again   150.9465743908099
no excellency i do not recollect telling you that   80.73054797773025
perhaps he never came here or if he did cæsar borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as i have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing   153.14660649684893
read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it   146.99442800175083
sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither   86.12505222851836
you must depart instantly monsieur   71.68509540702854
i threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow   134.82128826038394
did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris   87.19797163008934
you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept   136.0668370022568
you laugh   162.91199250284885
remain parry   154.4292314546654
let him have it let him have it she said   90.33561192053045
ah monsieur de rochefort   138.77571894808534
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos   69.61833580503986
the concierge who attended him had only been there since 1830   34.21090750103107
besides the king i am certain awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything   173.00773842973308
and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation   88.56653933266962
madame de villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bed curtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of valentine   79.00378595338799
danglars riveted attention eugénie s composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair   117.09149928190266
de tréville who held out his hand to him   87.66213565989736
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass   100.53667543716408
the marquis will give you some papers which will certify this fact and authorize you to appear under that name in the parisian world   73.0710082781867
there was only a change of bridegrooms   132.9918836707277
we took good care not to do that   148.86053324041995
that grimaud shall wait on us at table   52.353812883689024
danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation   44.32071545651388
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late   149.2030617023571
how do you do my dear son   96.16672327388756
indeed answered maximilian   207.54519987377242
mazarin leaned out of the window   121.91601605326389
well he is a man   14.362899681496614
you know such news much better than we do   71.1066814543468
excellencies said he the coach is ready   148.11001862264072
athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head   152.1025077712606
edmond started   119.26951533833336
the count watched him with a feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in l impartial who not only surrendered the castle of yanina but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that time fernand as our esteemed contemporary states   135.83686188412457
it is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind   66.20516077454114
aw   112.28134202110951
then addressing the man who accompanied him executioner said he do your duty   144.16940083737654
but i am sure of one thing that those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time   153.39983875092037
when i presented myself before you for the first time in london it was to ask you what had become of my fortune   67.2802830948545
asked the young man withholding his arm   126.14552290213997
20207m ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully   45.386400416024586
it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame bonacieux   115.5286562011369
the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments   46.47919179924034
he is black and can not speak returned monte cristo   90.56931763181109
well we must put up with that said the countess who was herself from one of the oldest venetian families   81.55012638770515
yes count   76.02662975241861
oh yes they will   126.54364240624017
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited   85.25428413501746
two of the men from jacopo s boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles   110.19860660941958
the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings   107.86614412675495
but continued d artagnan you shall judge of him for yourself   55.54149838679042
never mind sir we will not forget you   43.89092817639968
planchet said d artagnan cocking his pistols i will take charge of the one at the top   65.68233267075246
was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house   163.32790564534065
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it   111.83821945864034
interrupted valentine   181.81409550048016
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath   92.58247569550716
tell vitray to come to me said he and tell him to get ready for a journey   13.153343571741502
the guests looked at each other   93.6193702159701
there would be a very simple means very natural tell me what   153.6631933114606
and you do you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois   186.0417688761146
he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred   85.05663541607161
a gentleman laughed in my face   101.8397445566389
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1   115.05888451511008
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started   52.68632313561485
adieu sir   99.90136938460822
the young girl made a gesture of rage   119.68680280244664
and he began his story   97.48924550657487
whilst he thus hesitated the host re entered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot   104.51997322129326
you can understand dear friend with what hope i was inspired by that last letter   106.49302969735874
exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist   55.27268249063411
yes indeed to you   64.53498354860747
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry re ascended to his wife s chamber and found d artagnan just recovering his senses   164.41988215952782
have you never heard what oliver cromwell said when he came to paris and was shown the dungeon at vincennes where monsieur de vendome was imprisoned   146.63275008597253
no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered   126.23488826934206
said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you   186.36768942439346
so he was called the queen s invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs   133.71347075585078
the pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knows well they feast on the vulture   98.80005623301827
he followed m   49.97179613907326
then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room   141.67086263435834
but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their custom   16.44683535043785
a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely   174.0461677947813
indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity   139.0292699733167
i should make the first a nobleman like athos   114.01107240786126
like every weak mind was wanting in generosity   175.88582392881978
tis d artagnan s sword he said   37.671560413038236
judge if i should not put myself under its protection   143.47982699350922
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat   118.77754211376173
presently   113.08800087799278
well then and so he is in paris   105.4208550783536
dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend   140.5310931664389
then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre dame   144.46890487944566
the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience   174.86483669808646
given at constantinople by authority of his highness in the year 1247 of the hegira   154.78474847006854
she is dead   74.72673689222353
but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him   188.45976218976884
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful   79.48404313545454
i never saw a man with a nobler air than his   170.2015913902012
d artagnan related his story simply with the omission of names   193.69137102167102
but what can i do with you   145.27632467432846
let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob   118.6641212996097
my intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and i had seen them above twenty times   161.7272627579374
de villefort felt no effects   67.0368017919989
well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone   56.562682146429104
that s not fair said the seaman who had saved dantès   161.6671613304531
the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman has his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor a brigand a rascal has with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence chalais s throat cut under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry monsieur to the queen   136.7458005944738
d artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to milady s but she evaded him   113.20386559956312
but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest   178.61204631576604
monte cristo started   77.71697904266344
in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk   154.47052117485046
the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles   161.54001789976886
a light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles and from tunis to venice   88.17743811338869
porthos is in picardy   145.11564153392166
i have this instant left him replied mordaunt alighting in order to give his horse to a soldier to hold   181.79027872890842
count will you allow me to send baptistin to inquire after someone you know   19.394170710394235
i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you   109.9330396758601
and how did this misfortune occur   158.83665541811644
he was received by baptistin   150.79888947553854
for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself   104.91298342916905
she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass   78.69395249364851
i can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal   147.95438760076095
have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito   81.392383836032
you impose upon justice   40.13968645196678
then paused with hand in mid air   120.42280016006097
cried monsieur de bouillon evidently ill at ease   73.88403206597435
the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house   126.96551826165815
who and where is he   188.83042877764166
it was day   177.42813712331298
out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away   140.2845787999097
well my dear friend   129.42908912074392
in strafford s company said mordaunt tauntingly   212.43010351221284
replied athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my death   52.76002957941335
while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on d artagnan s finger the place of the queen s ring carefully kept in a casket   168.20706349569403
if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests   107.33753833449049
the parents of little la valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it   156.9237783291735
here s to porthos and aramis   67.37616049435144
let s be merciful to every sinner   108.88611141271707
and his father s immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme   179.38640874385675
oh count   82.26883656463576
i have two things to postpone   126.1250966985198
acknowledge that if albert is brave he can not be a coward   31.212182022340528
you bought it back then from monsieur des essarts   130.54681470807895
but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion   101.57621923570534
the old man s interrogative eye said which   153.41840681719333
by your reckoning i must be forty three at least   52.53405897718513
but as he said you would make an excellent steward i concluded you had stolen that was all   112.10960266889016
inquired villefort   134.02731709228493
then dantès departed for genoa   169.81402955378272
treat her as one of your sisters   17.59312017657355
tis true answered porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are a lot of them   96.59537282718259
to the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal valentine s condition   85.15099403763874
everything was in readiness   165.3864865653816
on the contrary my dear friend this diamond became our only resource   172.7408494914067
i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca   167.86577568128553
and at the end of three days when you would be cured well sir it would still do me a great honor to be your man   122.26389869541741
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc d angoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st   131.8222106686134
give these happy tidings to your sister my dear cousin   134.33160483851748
where he comes from i am ignorant   165.3764412698169
all this negotiation must be carried on openly   7.837520635458247
you shall have it   153.76177158318742
you will of course dispose of it in some way or other   62.15592931859572
oh my friend cried dantès on the contrary it seems as if i were reading a most interesting narrative   107.44414731002458
he found athos and aramis philosophizing   67.09126506122038
for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions   124.27155857078823
the name is wanting in this commission   73.79495801323236
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me   98.21018986551519
de guémené   149.85172002132458
gentlemen i know i am in the hands of an avenging god   82.32273401877065
ah but you are joking my worthy man   124.4245577245421
but there now take him he is your own for as long as you like   142.43023844963028
do you know what consoled him   157.27321488053818
at the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his foreknees   101.04988956570777
fernand s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars   168.57907768561705
when the lord commands said mordaunt his commands are not to be disputed   140.63375563797976
but here i ll pay you for us two   35.07863419311744
it appears that messieurs the musketeers keep guard said he   176.88047613486515
what is there more   79.95792873847749
he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the wall   112.44020878925748
offspring of the brain of the poor abbé faria had they not died with him   85.43402669028697
sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter   56.222966934913096
the black musketeers my lord   182.38946183672266
i sincerely pity you said d artagnan with an air of profound compassion   98.29227661825385
the coachman turning around gave friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain   82.89862224759332
tell me continued winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in france that henry iv   117.00036474249937
this jewel he bestowed on dantès upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement   95.84636892396547
with black eyes black hair black eyebrows   177.77695309835025
for when the gentleman was about to set out we perceived that his lackey was saddling monsieur porthos s horse as well as his master s   154.986944262382
cried d artagnan you will be shot   187.9393256237558
come here fellow   149.5717517322102
louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword which stood against a chair in a corner of the room   149.12215968550714
let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned signor pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self confidence   136.34549080037073
the first time he saw d artagnan you have come off well said he to him   19.22875957298379
did you send this wine aramis   74.48030591303049
what do you want m   34.23628481239747
in the proper time and place i will remember everything   108.89963535502562
asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture   113.21115277246678
the count knit his brow   140.91248746090142
go on my child said the count in the romaic language   99.27307025567707
but all took up the cry in chorus down with mazarin   97.20292014252789
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina   123.2188145433087
he looked from one to the other and after mordaunt he recognized groslow   196.017126156939
d artagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence   190.0375107495508
wounded   173.0901043333833
he jumped out of bed and ran to the window   96.21810279227606
blaisois was in a state of great excitement   219.3988657239216
then followed barrois the old servant of m   101.03650882795122
well yes and i had good reason to be so replied château renaud   111.37489005105915
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious   115.38418486298275
it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate   173.9499695634843
come then said the minister   64.07743056356087
making a sign to la houdinière and cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting   158.15700107138554
his three companions joined him   163.29971798629737
you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion   171.33437169074173
oh then let it be directly   95.59199261732171
but the soil was moist   101.78913629928321
he adored her   135.95972083588248
no i want to live   28.565724292692465
the time had at length arrived   138.004265096136
whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against you   171.52286676561187
allow me only to compliment m   119.71409791875502
porthos maintained a majestic silence   128.06290542587195
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so   47.216466974196194
in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable   84.16420815215955
how much were your animals worth porthos   175.0836503261292
captivity the second day milady dreamed that she at length had d artagnan in her power that she was present at his execution   84.00514714803708
and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon   158.26825842748525
villefort fully understood his father s meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders   49.52900095603917
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady   33.924795713056795
i would reform her   61.6189328009457
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris   188.3990272504487
he was passing the chinese baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saint martin and to be going towards the madeleine   184.46923159808426
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still   168.2581714592086
d artagnan was worn out with fatigue   161.4529230964009
at length she murmured satisfied with herself come nothing is lost   162.41220157229958
i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it   88.867231981309
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you   146.6002341959322
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply   81.1040572367461
because though i am not a baron by birth my real name is at least danglars   153.49625805769082
you are right duchess   99.0218248066991
a poor musketeer a beggar an unknown who hates slavery and finds himself ill placed in the world   142.60781489459066
oh that s of no consequence just now said mme   66.22799308744945
my god i am lost   144.28180618239642
i will proclaim the violence you have used toward me   184.53297558604942
i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor as christians   19.71323468712076
people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven   80.42586489195554
the ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors   134.83436720752564
guémené was reading aloud and everybody was listening to her with attention with the exception of the queen who had on the contrary desired this reading in order that she might be able while feigning to listen to pursue the thread of her own thoughts   145.93879963602134
do you doubt my word   78.03668370478897
in a moment that part of the floor on which dantès was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way   111.38037572305942
he must live   172.35491216083395
oh lackadaisy   111.53547243037856
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m   156.34836477645106
albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button hole   44.55709204002321
but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes   104.03324776738972
let us call i love him   167.9970112946241
we will see after the worthy mercer later   130.07908633921144
asked he of jacopo who sat down beside him   125.22105075086031
i stumbled by chance upon the memoirs of m   199.87276903189905
poor aramis   110.01355255972743
we are coming to the point whispered the governor   89.89502420623957
finally that the queen wants a brave intelligent devoted man to make a journey to london for her   59.260918977372036
but do you really believe it is she   147.91217295823077
de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death   116.81769127748804
mercédès read with terror the following lines the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès second in command on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo is the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris   116.77878101880214
has got off without any accident   115.30216391872702
thank you my good friend   73.84211097124006
at a quarter to six o clock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace   100.65923463555639
i go to london   145.30712846133275
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes   175.41108173532493
i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself   96.45303829391979
but to return to these registers   65.81860656963613
i call to witness the god who hears us that on the contrary i am a fervent catholic   112.74928564509997
your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome   45.36182209138404
in the clover fields beyond the chestnut trees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning song   116.93088871038253
true said madame danglars   122.75576341169754
you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy   199.40201976321782
well but can t you speak   154.87451863025163
she goes into england said athos   57.437285240662845
the slave respectfully signalized that he had   68.87325953362526
said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl   79.03043537857812
and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the marais for having for so long a time lived near the place royale lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling   135.04857996458534
as villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brother in law is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son   129.19736293553112
i must reach compiègne tonight or i shall cause deep anxiety to my family   200.90334078199
replied athos in his calm vibrating voice   90.53901772662778
and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty it is probable that i am in error   79.00296247807329
have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming   43.715624382210976
her will be done like that of god in all things   124.70820519609218
de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province   124.43914999600517
well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king   130.36915348001116
i feel cramps over my whole body   114.66869444284983
but you my friend are you not going to change your dress   86.59154934087354
the second he wounded me in the breast   104.14954482633081
there is but one way left you that is safe said she   105.58034550970493
it is the password   167.76548773835998
did you hear   149.39909632602806
i do not know whether i love you or love you not   152.84260377007132
i did replied the count   174.79128590926626
i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that   165.82671321424417
keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nîmes   82.18532523493123
and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to me   103.96858390462562
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine no   134.89668947194104
and very soon they left the inn   106.7144934860413
the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed   93.82745660875514
he did not give it up   128.14342462231508
and yet he had not gained the goal for there were still the landing place and the antechamber   152.09477516725377
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass   128.43649242339288
oh no no count cried maximilian seizing the count s hands pray laugh   160.83851340691132
what have you done with her then if you have her no longer   68.96716238499499
have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you   114.71647576722813
a pretty silence truly   95.72178582781605
why that question my dear host   141.01415172453943
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethe s heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristo s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger   143.89977955189588
to the scaffold with the poisoner to the scaffold   136.7191484014547
by my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in it   94.51956216096539
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door   103.55802746907545
he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith entered   157.24485539061186
asked milady sharply   133.22363365425932
the table had disappeared only i had still the knife in my hand   61.60002247279982
i did not venture to ask sir   154.64569423612244
all that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial der teufel   158.96029462599972
until this day and for how long a time   185.37445460957298
the thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts   162.03719278197696
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop   89.83876151515383
how acts the judge   164.25093042969044
porthos and aramis looked at each other   112.63992426615833
asked athos quickly   116.6756611150515
added d artagnan timidly   179.78335572266965
she has ordered relays of horses   117.64425843307859
the surprised groom retired   138.2019574518826
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge   115.10308283370567
so young it is impossible said mercédès replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private reflection   115.66814872382675
but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner   140.27546427909922
he fell back cursing with rage   120.62288202548842
19 god has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment   110.16760871870567
she there found rochefort s lackey and gave him his instructions   81.64077314855382
i declare i feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard   209.02598518199764
i mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion   196.4536999110034
we are betrayed said the king in a low voice   81.70243454489363
so i yesterday addressed another epistle to her still more pressing than the first   77.54830265722278
they are carved from granite   84.27364620461995
do you hear that delightful cavatina   120.50091134762225
gentlemen said d artagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six   135.04586017643751
anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition   137.00197504884065
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword   58.97177385208841
mazarin did not even turn around   139.72180464591827
but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream   110.67075869336662
cried olivain in his turn   194.7433893454364
well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly   114.4717128050574
is he some minister out of office   77.6242332891859
oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again   83.06736868510595
i have told you my wish or rather my determination   144.02628164008814
you look like four conspirators   79.94039987956867
but we are now about to mix in society to visit and be visited   66.0764544896289
a sort of smile played on his lips   195.45763104109463
it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villefort s dressing room i saw i tell you silently enter a white figure   60.25691065405137
like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan   131.90075201365227
then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which virgil attributes to his goddesses   155.39679859841655
d artagnan owned nothing   140.28155503086532
how are you to get away from here   58.85160315816189
he was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for counsel   85.23852378620836
i remember well that diamond which belonged to the queen   139.7499529218449
you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to do   136.3789875261766
the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies   131.12588608182222
besides we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose   80.49927191491662
and what is that proof   157.45799266298184
well said aramis what do you say to that   144.84220789719848
now i think of it you can do better said danglars   194.43112020542253
you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said d artagnan   99.32587295430403
for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others   141.94935261520965
asked he smiling   59.48200257720797
no i did not know it   87.54923181024097
i am brave   90.44038395476406
athos colored a little and answered should i go i shall be delighted to see you there   109.49147393346051
she is my sister in law   167.59374429136398
pardi answered athos we only carried off his mother   123.21331003685995
ah there you are my good d arminges   112.80089582813467
monsieur de lillebonne lead my horse by the bridle if you please   15.692893866381013
see if he is still in the same place   84.53202310287764
toward six o clock m   149.97957228785054
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles   96.43425613145408
what are you thinking of d artagnan   183.3018074802876
at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats   91.97428680742782
the chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and retired   102.95059595717811
chapter lxxi   48.87311044223321
said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it incomparable   107.71336365925708
this wound my dear d artagnan has been a warning to me from heaven   181.55600711725538
when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied milady in a tone of deep conviction god pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom   147.47005356536513
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued   58.72908224539694
apropos are we to speak of your friends also athos porthos and aramis   121.85828329815654
no no you do yourselves injustice   75.78047920185583
but hark   96.75146430873438
a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance   56.85962753415094
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening before   60.02241532506201
it often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life   78.4629944688229
and you d artagnan   139.91107329300166
the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what o clock it was   117.51306221540638
monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice   118.47416513785605
upon my word the drum draws near said d artagnan   60.214271211280575
but to make good ones increases fame witness monsieur de rotrou   54.751076807507616
you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence   144.0128419404623
and when i was removed to the château d if i managed to bring the ravellings with me so that i have been able to finish my work here   143.73823656572782
for they had scarcely sailed half a league when d artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation   35.744701545675284
did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste   118.52414921061363
de villefort s office   165.82153379691187
you see then said athos there is a god in heaven still   133.22048092761332
will you go away from here   48.42416776845016
in an hour it will be at the door   192.80521845908868
you have once before thrown yourself in my path   161.10696148225404
shall i speak to him   118.36090459965102
yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand   93.85604427392208
a woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her presence   84.66490417052637
at the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay   131.25112144602267
it was forty eight hours since i had taken any nourishment   116.72534829725119
well in the champs élysées there resides a very rich gentleman   156.17958528418256
oh no said kitty it is not me you love   61.01675579926777
no his name is the count of monte cristo   158.8502769667428
well you shall have your five hundred francs said andrea   144.11676799727
the thunder growled in the distance   113.25673371647783
take these said beauchamp presenting the papers to albert   134.04951947754995
merciful heaven   140.58926988107353
the queen then gave her orders spoke of a banquet which the marquis de villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it announced another visit on the following day to val de grace where she intended to pay her devotions and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her   121.98632270145632
on my honor i have no idea   123.61509511637239
full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself well nigh recovered   141.37678436586023
yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen   13.32415771642971
and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering   56.51228768700073
madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last   156.07346487518203
and fifty empty ones   143.46476896435053
how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme   108.45990324087546
fortunately however he had not been taken   129.44363753754092
did you not say she was dead   90.47947056349041
your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome   130.6621039505314
and what misfortune could happen to me   62.593975099372535
i detest her from antipathy   116.98228038869698
look at her still beautiful witty more charming than ever   130.95473143639884
does it happen to be jacopo manfredi   46.139574479879
at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so   74.58857330875176
what i mean to say is this sir that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred excuse me said morcerf but is it a play we are acting   99.12214360929808
but in our situation we must not say all we know particularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues   77.69748808882144
god be praised   88.9969427348558
tis that exactly   177.57889745523667
if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy   152.26106259232648
yes monsieur in this house   134.2779256031164
on the contrary it is of her   104.33965501627253
but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious   103.1730223917723
we shall go together shall we not   233.14948382510386
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you   177.09980083498678
sir said the young man do you not come from paris if you please   167.46111519249976
when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodière he arrived at m   93.15163558133628
the young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the servants   46.44278058730674
explain yourself i beg   125.6637301657761
valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his hand   109.43625543042388
yes yes repeated the major yes there is a postscript   128.09048430888552
it was five o clock in the afternoon   78.36910243109295
on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him a veritable soldier   167.67580294542734
by a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and raoul began to write   109.0911297493701
who s there   37.388559805823405
never had he been so well received   123.57392095821577
so be it said d artagnan   93.12478145813643
hair sandy red more red than sandy   114.01051973641343
and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself   149.5613273230428
take care you are going to immure a traveller sinbad the sailor a man who comes to see paris   110.0031168606915
exclaimed emmanuel while two large tears rolled down julie s cheeks never behold you again   229.74667475567531
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happy   155.44142644313348
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms   162.81262126989807
scarcely had he shut her door when mercédès called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he observed   114.71965237207236
the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of her amorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her   29.90133513862949
he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock   208.12008898807386
take courage said grimaud   104.16727460796498
asked the fruiteress   123.19909049182417
the other night she left   150.47280609213448
first i was a forger answered andrea as calmly as possible   72.53232275976478
there are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty   151.0696846091954
the reflections of the mercer were already made   126.70085353259522
did you know that i am at liberty   81.82352591124469
besides you sent me word that you would come to me and i have held myself at your disposal   84.157484851775
then let us draw on the spot   76.96259406464247
because a mistress is one of the cardinal s favorite means   79.67225635108798
said the baron suspiciously   123.51086370927177
courage we have them   7.05746632051131
3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister   140.72650331161609
because i should never get a better   105.71885201189852
do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him   71.61217081629914
i have made a bargain   119.62296666375843
while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order   52.06452435795229
dantès for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night   62.313990108375094
since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room   136.3379239163669
after reading the letter villefort covered his face with his hands   95.09079440983955
for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward   47.3423041271228
lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the interior   60.77625422154429
he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and low   187.00264280680744
not so for it is religious replied aramis   105.16359865880982
well we won t speak of it any more then   26.690832234628957
something whatever it was the cask contained fell silently into the tankard   137.83951205207984
what with d artagnan grimaud and mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them   78.16025506483507
no it is bazin   67.2060728154719
a little before they came to fromelles the storm burst   110.71536482962081
and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot   113.78465413520895
danglars left   128.98525132634973
why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from mazarin   122.32013078413996
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o clock   156.67449802242845
you have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you   141.0429754968109
cried a voice from the landing   85.15317499600917
he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw   119.76469121568272
who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection   185.27698379455586
no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found   168.32176773395906
a nice acquaintance my friend   60.73909420431423
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart   148.07562276205792
it was called the palais cardinal before richelieu gave it to the king   64.33841541178306
he had made his valet cover him with honey   120.35511838237665
yes but they have found a corpse   160.88422465276568
the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o clock in the morning   93.33601514173702
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden   114.37603666863077
she was an ardent passionate mistress abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to feel   158.12467589852116
it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied   108.956692323282
the carriage drove on and d artagnan availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner   143.8698012447247
unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me   155.67605198872576
a left handed man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it   97.38436281496806
and i clung to life partly on my sister s account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance   155.74644102631734
that would be a misfortune said de winter and i shall begin to think that we are really doomed   202.65124859970757
oh she is perfectly lovely what a complexion   192.62780948868527
noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame   125.05494910501571
the soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer   174.2446898290026
to paris first   61.12385818716358
it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de villefort   126.49407881769288
he was a brave and an honest man   98.77211342557092
and on my honor if i had discovered that it was his son i should have regretted having killed him   97.57774909600599
asked dantès   60.39283790249784
but it will be dark in the cellar   136.57859012753943
murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is i who promise this   169.4725499998584
no i have never seen him   117.47619965424656
the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him   48.54407383748324
why this is a victory   99.84952354610073

but i have always given it up   148.54127081530117
the cardinal took the letter and read it with the greatest attention   127.65228596017646
athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry him   142.32456324923325

noirtier again closed his left eye   118.52932808346299
yes doctor   88.63100486661115
planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow d artagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left   133.52019094943944
the fair indian approached scarron   183.4889669268227
she particularly has them by dozens   122.9758824499626
one of its chiefs who understood provençal begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats ashore   117.67922907704369
guard the prisoners well i beg of you   152.4913810453847
the names of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket   103.77153207771025
exclaimed andrea   99.04361376001532
you are wounded   132.43560419853156
and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might   114.19393119095226
the duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary terror   127.9162212718604
at nine o clock tomorrow rita s father will be here with the money   162.69963378651968
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair   123.05630912759472
de tréville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private   122.70331357166303

oh all this is a family history as château renaud told you the other day observed maximilian   161.94733922919073
a recollection of athos came into her mind   161.90904846871112
yes said valentine   113.97625124751706
while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover   114.70885024115798
ay there s no fear in the daytime   78.4620752887323
for the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis and the stingy fellow would only give me eighty   97.81901501294243
it was my forgetfulness then   65.70314887539689
de winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy   147.02879796861257
prudence monsieur is a virtue sufficiently useless to musketeers i know but indispensable to churchmen   145.1432769388242
and you are going to portsmouth   120.2765558313102
if it be so we trust your eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real position   133.13494533453786
but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie i saw you arranging a deposit is not that the term   161.2749073430336
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition too   115.48581194644652
as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the puritan   106.61372093003023
and will you go   86.40864984693931
an island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count   38.10566903886247
at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter   175.34690237980186
for the present he had no anxiety   78.8362315388946
grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his arm   158.58267281038633
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape   156.0145904657748
not at all not at all said mazarin   140.74519454052356
that was d artagnan s road as he was going to the louvre   196.2743406294063
are you sure that we are not its objects   158.29524567334113
well we will wait a week a month two months if need be and meanwhile your strength will return   133.6720674778613
this man was cromwell   75.11861357704889
what fine things we would do together   185.60648334020243
the baroness took advantage of her husband s absence to push open the door of her daughter s study and m   39.82165246441825
40206m i have no reply to make said the count in a low tone   19.164238562106163
living you will not lose your life through me   116.31063780059492
two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of nettuno and the other as a woman of la riccia   148.90446360768647
but it can not be   196.95472096408935
he sprang into his saddle   154.2266454118305
well well cried d artagnan this reconciliation is truly touching   133.08893381450088
the snow deadened the noise of his fall   141.9326988679359
compose yourself madame said he   27.588224778663914
when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the gold headed cane which he held in his hand   48.87638887057844
caderousse became thoughtful   142.77710132050066
oh lord   115.33704966228468
as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him   195.09276951310227
prepare yourself maximilian he said with a smile   81.34683038555193
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion   125.48882642908647
my dear porthos   74.51942447090406
that is but fair replied monte cristo   109.31971805314147
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and i should run mad   78.96525113120279
he was introduced   101.62209798281614
they could not long delay bringing her a repast   129.926073195334
besides we shall be there at the time of the flight   157.0920084234984
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought   146.64073852234688
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the night light held it up as if to test its transparency   116.60322720834947
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he   159.6067272783913
to hold for five minutes the gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder   121.66433610928898
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the count   139.61933776437752
then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you   138.97060890681905
he had tried his strength to the utmost   142.95232350789527
were fruitless   101.52489514129549
now then what do you say to that   115.27812684517664
the girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply   204.59785905594345
wait said bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted wax light with which he started the church candles   77.95917519334763
you don t mention those who aided and abetted the deed said caderousse   64.24285936964952
a short time ago while making researches in the royal library for my history of louis xiv   74.17787587867744
let him be sent for instantly   44.07621881506175
i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career   92.79611987599237
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful   45.8969965183187
ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi barefooted and out at elbows with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully curved above the head stared at the traveller the post chaise and the horses   123.90281735009486
at six o clock the curate of st   142.33711346972757
suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pele mele the intrenchments with the fugitives   111.218019240727
while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief   185.61514893135796
if one s lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly   119.03167564496289
but she has most likely returned to the louvre   151.63384561552155
at the end of a year dantès was a new man   114.74085055567802
but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said monte cristo   113.43202371385286
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp   31.21647629489135
i demand the suppression of the thesis   141.5751452411223
and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not a thing to be feared   122.44135746061636
besides it came into the young man s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair   110.42509727599996
he called for me at seven o clock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the door keepers to place me in a box   39.26902405547969
write to me at paris to m   88.55828295227684
good caderousse he said how happy you will be   104.77615917565417
a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head   92.26786148994802
it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls   223.10380863046254
shall i complain of him   52.70655030239612
in the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddlehorses   113.70528847574514
ah sire   185.67697802105573
monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him   45.46120734498088
excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture   195.30335748950907
duchâtel or from m   66.79245815675871
the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish   75.51775549182963
you will allow me to leave first   212.60848348065372
no ceremony will be neglected in my house   61.48041381926497
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage   98.36239012862826
upon my honor this man fancies the world belongs to him   140.09582208512538
he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow   80.35212551732418
you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you   152.34854687380954
what is there in them   114.08287066743455
but since the time milady stabbed herself however short the wound had closed   79.4806267390698
now i think no more   136.90460131073644
drink a glass of pure water it will restore you   9.048965341876126
you will tell monsieur de tréville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him   166.30046174396256
the count de rochefort   155.89236377798
bear with him whispered aramis   122.76641153167412
cried the abbé   25.7424782310853
i your excellency   107.87520905227659
i never lie madame   49.429754619238665
they are the spoils of victory   76.03153299446817
at that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone athos made a bound of surprise   115.839219523168
the idea came over my mind and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance   139.81221450960194
the damps of the dew bathed the head of villefort and refreshed his memory   126.76716772310319
and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong   125.1218405811556
then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner charles began   100.2273911027357
morrel was there   129.60240960962653
montrose beaten at philiphaugh was obliged to disperse the remains of his army and to fly disguised as a servant   158.3169542263212
the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment   130.1332794535576
our future our ambition   113.74498006963097
marshal de grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to vendin leaving the duc de chatillon to await and bring on the rest   201.64318008793583
but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth   299.17745475926927
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you suffer   132.11278203892647
said she thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer   132.19878313392704
and will he aid this project   99.08626330151813
yes replied monte cristo these blazons prove that   147.22692321717727
it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by observation   58.6647420127599
i will obey you at all points   102.18566975344717
and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so   138.59539355254128
but the wine was good and he was convinced   116.68401017699289
madame replied monte cristo you must not ask of us the manufacturers of fine porcelain such a question   141.96313835429655
no replied the turnkey   12.577375034657678
but will you have the kindness to wait a moment   205.26408254373894
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the gospel   130.59368463440472
d artagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed   169.29952810799261
my friend you impose a painful task on me   64.70490372510758
what matter   151.99184292338674
before that is expired some idea will occur to me   1.6839622119778426
madame these conferences will bring us peace   129.94411894165438
sir said mazarin to porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us   100.25744453905135
but still no prisoner fell down as they expected   158.0786933670437
said he to the baron   82.6717870176698
she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going   173.5174033130394
i do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask m   152.82847957655284
how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know   169.32670407253926
albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances   64.16056777071482
she should have wanted nothing   105.5786934916262
a retired baker   86.3284041930373
oh i know what that is   218.24273934611873
valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob again   134.73020794872988
a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith   91.81731864095734
the fifth of october it was about six o clock in the evening   60.31651698660791
she is what the english call a yacht   135.43381479171094
look said he is it not strange   139.21687605836138
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric in ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous   51.84762139285717
the horse   25.455003115019863
porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence   164.57343882114668
d artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeer s uniform in every street of the camp   134.38030230187186
he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head   94.27502780968054
i am aware he is a furious royalist   118.17995739694436
but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois   79.14487358962991
as to love the only woman he could have loved was mme   131.43710469776434
i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto   133.51939994884896
only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made   145.53263017276282
said he is the hotel on fire   181.0235245345192
what did you answer him   107.79205776312445
a king said d artagnan   41.97915901892277
said d artagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in gold   114.72042280318385
alas no my lord   93.66869485589507
and do you know whither he went   129.44385313674667
he awoke   143.92334053413455
a man wishes to see monsieur at home replied bazin   139.55656449454068
well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared suddenly   108.4828586531153
you mean that this demands explanation do you not   154.77824868061236
this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their wedding   69.2588391405393
oh it amuses me   131.46141491895798
all three then cried all s over   244.46214760141876
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me   69.2468893614973
your majesty will not forget that i have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture   136.75193628312235
although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobility s boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants   138.22519102670003
said bonacieux astonished   134.51703706966583
demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made   104.03250352981019
all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling   135.2168011791814
with gratitude   156.98332202842903
that is my conclusion   83.24417577437984
the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates   80.99990412143411
morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playing cards fixed against the wall   80.53391366089832
then he will be able to give us an answer tonight   83.25505662647969
do you know who is captain of this vessel   199.86686279991267
whom must i announce to my lord duke   48.49217535945036
she will escape us replied the young man   112.45019691254296
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin   133.1126712061652
danglars disappearance   47.91465477608395
but look me in the face   158.99240309418053
what would you have my dear fellow   169.24435990825282
but this mission was to prepare men s minds for a return it is the man who says this sire a return which will soon occur   133.92499253058025
why should my father fly   101.89329615047798
you have then overheard our conversation   107.23488390290935
martin he would call for him on his way   161.82464381796402
at the first word the cardinal spoke of mme   182.36364218947278
cried the former musketeer   82.86827765973092
nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day   19.153462188302854
20317m caderousse shuddered   132.70615790045667
i have perhaps offended you in your creed   116.62659596467206
at the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was satisfied   86.23646027340317
the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer   151.8096296575349
i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers   52.490588452213885
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion   181.2672402997255
it looks more like bankruptcy   107.06535780624506
we are sufficiently well bred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to be   161.21967198098315
on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell   70.90105633103323
alas it is not the death of the body i regret   145.04703444540206
a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were fire on that bench   103.31773396098635
they are not dead for the death of d artagnan would make a sensation   106.32130199544929
this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out   141.4300120867091
he will spoil the feast   107.94052245792876
it is prudence   10.40886831102506
i say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of paris will give us 50 000 francs for it   148.2538662839375
we are tottering always but we never fall and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us   186.24248582096266
the burning marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light   85.42019445046076
exclaimed renée turning pale   89.5432916703491
then d artagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted friend   118.405241841886
here indeed are true believers   68.81661950133663
dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew   157.72352967568847
if you reach your home safely leave paris leave france and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well i will send you a small annuity   128.90048995188928
you told him it was for me   175.83706681995682
danglars returned at this moment alone   136.76406473134753
are you asleep that you don t answer when i ring   38.905535070320326
for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it   125.15887639580772
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes   105.93509979051073
d artagnan monsieur   88.47448668963163
that is to say without a sou in his pocket but with a fund of audacity shrewdness and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his   48.6325924960596
who then urged you to write   133.58085218342904
but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory   97.0187343940008
d artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor   151.71734975964304
do you know this house monsieur   141.60661584179954
now then who are you   133.674177501728
in the court he found penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them   109.92415929349582
after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed   87.50105473636881
to auteuil   194.91864943407222
all the preparations were made with a frightful calmness   152.4699101233674
the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina   80.30612129979235
and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse   214.27451476900154
maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little   166.4813220621027
after being the instrument of human justice i aspired to be that of the justice of god   140.65813793584098
he was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around   143.43005941102152
there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver   98.09656196327843
without doubt the chancellor séguier looked about at that moment for the rope of the famous bell   122.3585727113167
at what o clock please your majesty   111.86545966123168
well done carlini   199.2040533360874
it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption   141.1559706470872
what can you expect athos   130.16088716045977
and then too old dantès incessantly said to her our edmond is dead   76.0343769459337
we shall be driven by a state councillor   119.4958299597738
like jupiter they like to cross the race   62.87760376714617
planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servant man with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself   172.09179727661518
besides in accepting it she added in a voice full of emotion you render me a much greater service than you imagine   146.12656403951135
sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be   81.39697385258745
the comte de la fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit   138.1004999190552
you know it is not my fault said morrel   174.4741285915589
the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment   87.00844015320837
these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union   101.93393801471528
come let us see them   121.20172992048529
i suppose not   77.71975076473193
the count had watched the approach of death   25.975936550662738
where the devil shall i say that he is so that he can not try to rejoin him   106.80556204413695
i ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore alone   45.31893990890009
deep grief was depicted on morrel s features   163.20532932929842
at one moment bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light which illumined the sea for the space of a league they might each be seen each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which even in their hearts of bronze they could not help experiencing   145.47321827656748
and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news   85.76371939512777
de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling   137.26804381088112
well said the other if this last resource fail you   116.7414664226774
i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself   130.53432983193247
well i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health   159.8688839200372
you have seen my dear albert i ask the question as a mother you have seen m   123.43725869215052
because these horses are not to be sold was the reply   36.696668252114705
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us   111.65778497730976
alas sir i never had any opinions   163.18392978581815
it was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place   174.18780169466655
and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door   135.6890885545052
said he which meant do you see him   50.087894120799476
i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m   81.44603494351163
but that menace terrifies me   120.96786247249065
yes i have heard it said replied the coadjutor   128.5522257990359
and i said aramis imagined that i had given almost my last sou to the church of montdidier and the jesuits of amiens with whom i had made engagements which i ought to have kept   143.833210231774
while he was speaking albert had heard the report of two or three pistol shots   103.72059826942635
what could she have done to you   226.00935377331797
the regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct   39.168013788530146
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there   166.5579711382107
but whence have you obtained them   110.69495767099889
the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen and repeated in a low voice it was scarcely nine o clock when i heard a noise in the street and was wondering what it could be when on coming to my door i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it   77.14305153801106
men were giants in those times said athos   99.67194986437298
is someone dead in his house   65.16161312323442
the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m   49.408635527089515
well i hoped to get an exchange of arms to substitute the sword for the pistol   98.6400718969846
while i well   84.15579557493261
oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after i have had the happiness to possess you only a single time   228.58050465368683
what will they leave him   87.46901040623312
the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight   26.876383721735067
bazin was then at the height of joy   97.33297086162814
your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table   120.59048999637871
cried d artagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one   95.81979248475847
but in this circumstance i am but the instrument which the king employs   59.20931341607591
and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars   105.39484727121416
morrel for after this first visit has been paid i have another which i am most anxious to pay   119.98806941610255
live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is summed up in these two words wait and hope   114.77570751705393
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left d artagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything   198.8918071659655
on the watch what   149.12750442860676
but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm   96.67088881414443
ah said he involuntarily following noirtier s eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed   145.0103449988641
read the address   173.44349538292602
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand   93.5045507231119
yes i dare say   117.17083230323601
never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon m   153.58316673410877
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated   72.59226030415738
milady being well prepared for the reception of felton was able to erect her batteries for the next day   64.86483736838679
cried monte cristo thrusting his hands into his hair   156.80870870641758
de bassompierre who was embroiled with the duc d angoulême   116.65097607863055
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity   129.43761425131052
give three to your wife and you will still have four   152.06561576130363
that is to say when i am dull and i sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and i shoot rabbits   21.82654277963684
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them   103.78841301518031
exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom   117.67169322156747
oh my lord said d artagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the palais royal whether they be venetian or parisian   138.37927656736247
athos alone smiled with a self possessed disdainful smile   60.903107965772755
it was to this effect tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing   92.01113521829328
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach   215.3036741744402
i have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that i am become passive in the hands of the almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an eagle   144.28898636505176
that is right   34.10413886637711
i say captain said the sailor who had cried courage   136.4620027460503
d artagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men   121.23095970306002
will this be permitted me   112.77364734720543
put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen   156.07713364111814
cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and mademoiselle eugénie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like thalberg   132.5514013054187
but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen   112.65573268537592
you kill me   123.36390323076915
all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land   143.41083585967198
why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our lives in his hands   98.00661141011204
oh how happy you make us   120.1507001630048
and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb   48.58741779560256
it is beautiful is it not   91.17382778354653
come come said andrea sheathe your sword my fine fellow   88.25371737133842
because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyone s neck a four and twenty pound ball a large hole is chopped in the vessel s bottom and then they leave her   63.445746930388275
he had now to seek the second   138.42974016652312
i had a plan   111.42574070779136
go there   159.86150801332738
as for myself that i may put you at your ease i tell you that i am generally called sinbad the sailor   162.39667838815086
the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me   210.44264527476693
i understand perfectly   172.82909756894884
said vampa with a smile   73.54076255322292
the yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl   49.561251346462925
i will make you all captains with good pensions   81.88735983544885
morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owner s hand m   63.478958385827944
porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison   127.18174442108358
and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands   68.98490085573363
a second scream more piercing than the first now sounded   151.96119310924593
but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness   78.67119424735364
barrois cried valentine barrois   123.50327973301525
why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other   122.69365406461037
villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the corpse   82.41185725735353
this wine will give you strength drink   99.4538363236286
more dead than alive he looked around him   143.6662592039246
the builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed   192.93578311966928
i follow you though i am not hungry   78.1946895610204
it would quite cut me up   189.07885408799524
meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed   155.84580327517125
you will be riddled   82.19048827826876
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place   118.6677621966202
and if i am taken i will swallow it   194.97722443132173
said d artagnan we don t now make war as we did formerly   108.65430251329362
they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted d artagnan to rueil   163.5136301948407
said the cardinal three men placed hors de combat in a cabaret squabble   82.9924162622336
this is all i can say sir   120.06308055669452
give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal   127.67972565143894
you pledge yourself to that marshal   137.98716694614643
all danger is over   47.54379893610674
the moment is at hand he said   88.59955493257507
yes i heard   8.237596325405065
well did there not happen an event which saved austria   68.73463908304291
do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house   122.10608208523877
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept   51.660392600120225
he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head   91.38107429972987
the next day about nine o clock in the morning he landed at st   159.8987366964162
bertuccio bowed   64.32807256992805
it is owing to him that we are free   139.82243209880477
he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge   113.89516099815803
that devil porthos is a man of prodigious strength   180.72129350834513
for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d emery   137.98971281871735
fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to pathaud s account   170.95293058580566
a prisoner at vincennes   151.18752121972895
but the man in the dark could not find the right key   125.56455575139634
six years sufficed to achieve this object   98.38133441795308
the mayor had hanged the mutineers   57.84543593385972
the remembrance of milady recurred to d artagnan   71.36223668789889
and of this profound skillful and anxious study the result was that felton everything considered appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors   118.71908387863341
we will say no more about it then   122.7339222120372
very well you will force it said porthos   122.54226911635244
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him   155.070216155496
you do not know mercédès   106.81338096374091
as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble   141.12603481926251
the law would seize it and put you in prison   128.3856074571653
by the saint maur gate   158.39739336772857
in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast   183.06576116102852
be silent dear du vallon and resign yourself   149.64620235473717
said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty   77.21710944644157
when i informed him that your lordship was the protégé of monsieur de tréville and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman he appeared to be very much disturbed and asked me where that letter was and immediately came down into the kitchen where he knew your doublet was   140.487171617555
noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter s room and watched her with his paternal tenderness   116.48361511477367
monte cristo chose this moment for re entering the drawing room   163.52277511469683
but can you not say that sir   78.89710807930658
one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared   103.84544446146572
but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions   169.35925309410757
it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle   100.81681783105397
zounds lieutenant   138.03239166224947
mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond   98.48515496900585
but what is the use of harnesses without horses   84.14171775693387
morrel answered danglars   86.3690656076322
yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria   96.58437018184209
it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback   115.99169717220693
perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said porthos   158.0365849429735
org you must at no additional cost fee or expense to the user provide a copy a means of exporting a copy or a means of obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original plain vanilla ascii or other form   91.61893764318413
as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his maneuvers   146.55989432591943
he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on l impartial the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor   142.36873524711407
the drop of water rochefort had scarcely departed when mme   153.4897322036992
his love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his heart   100.93201991466474
from a good source sir   167.06170897489858
i swear by don t waste time in swearing said d artagnan   62.45767280115663
and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you   134.4145108318334
really captain said d artagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french   160.9011643734912
it s a good omen master groslow look out for the king   47.561663663236175
the young officer entered   149.6198623337234
arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the rue vaugirard   125.57935002039385
in the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them   42.223320556187275
my dear monsieur de rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal   189.15825356239202
it would have the success of one of monsieur patru s pleadings   65.93313868045243
on the contrary it was he who under the count s guidance followed a course of archæology mineralogy and natural history   68.70133759326188
the count takes me for a provincial   104.8653123588387
at that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone   102.04553309442548
no i shall go as i am   101.25917121338189
for milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber itself   132.78943126582243
you are not afraid   201.82732176109366
i love your devotedness said milady   117.78872847078922
cried athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an adder   111.97137703193327
keep guard at the other door athos and aramis   87.9701097137581
i monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibited i seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder is broken   80.9056548093927
in the whole house said friquet   158.72861052464268
were you a priest i should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind   68.69344924223549
you offer me your services   135.67832607314875
you seek me sir said he   68.14172368940481
embrace me my son   101.18026879388033
d artagnan and porthos armed with their swords and athos and aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was charles stuart s prison   52.40342460216529
the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least   115.20225048509488
i defended the king   132.78317900829748
murmured athos while porthos broke the bottles and aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent for   68.01037504591977
inquired the abbé with a laugh   150.1825534186781
this funeral is the news of the day   80.73384234268163
the jailer feared he was dangerously ill   140.51200055034548
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may stop at châtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply   93.86496659955549
i will go with you   115.76798666050254
and who completed it as it now is   120.48430120134103
if i like   92.59734190096128
while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each   135.61335849351667
tell me where you are conducting me and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate   160.26046057219773
i am not precisely rich though i am pretty well off   144.77437340228238
we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shed that is our mutual guaranty   83.26795048660807
cried athos don t fire   148.9243524849962
clear sky swift flitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared   53.639441776688166
every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears   64.4976823537508
felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of james i   101.43739562192896
you are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet and yet i speak ill of him replied milady finishing the thought of the superior   132.34877956552475
the mistress of that fellow d artagnan   168.6951227875644
sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademoiselle de villefort still determines on marrying m   45.09793833522494
then let us be as we used to be   114.09362204997673
but vampa raised his head proudly   133.98410654304703
but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up   128.19769108520347
said athos and what puts you out of breath thus   105.28199346679315
you mean the colosseum   49.921228055262134
now if you are mad and try to bite me i will kill you without pity   159.9975453743402
besides you will accompany me   127.8666651523857
on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat   87.30000080144458
he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all   86.30251236486052
and i too said d artagnan   134.06346400281672
de tréville in a somewhat softened tone   68.27097318463063
inquired the young man who was in command in the chief s absence   99.19186081528858
but where is he   68.54869625630614
all paris was in expectation   66.52023278276238
seven men in two days and those of his very best   77.5412729335124
do you know my dear villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries when questioned by his majesty s principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condé   92.48053755409556
this was a good omen for morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine   165.6834139752723
but the man who was under him   112.35677681093291
at least delay the trial till the next assizes   228.53512411897705
the procurator s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud all surrounded by duchesses and marchionesses who cast bags of money at his feet   102.97427399802878
that is unfortunate returned monte cristo   142.07414067652795
then you forget me so much the better   56.810522026511336
pray tell me how   68.38182889027455
i shall adore god sir said raoul respect royalty and ever serve the king   132.9059591639294
i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant   159.0603053351054
haydée s arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands   161.9590773374187
and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord   65.86381258256344
and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing   156.64311899351307
de la trémouille commanded a little reflection   89.33495923408807
if my society would not be disagreeable   97.12231539676189
and then said eugénie while turning over the leaves of madame de villefort s album add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man   124.77431023801476
the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array   173.73417433694135
then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the jesuit entreated me to get him made a musketeer   108.67129282817082
or from your generosity my friend   89.03407946426735
noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the king s attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed   82.17764992550286
cried louise   104.66991471659762
but what a singular fancy this is of yours count you who are the very flower of our nobility to squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the frondists   199.14419588928348
sir said franz i have one request to make   56.48932962252102
zounds monsieur   183.8557922826654
the woman is an agent of the cardinal   140.94016886267832
screamed she turning towards the wall as if she would tear an opening with her hands   81.61148121191854
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her   74.04234669156735
i drunk   61.47463218629905
0085m nay madame   110.11061276844926
he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear   96.84093998894653
much obliged my dear kitty   114.23020805927689
at once dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again   76.11463617467666
inquired de guiche   104.3726984269522
sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language   137.33440148731904
oh sire what a dreadful misfortune   105.76846455009019
but i will know it   139.11911466841175
misfortune refreshes the memory   131.94900691811006
d artagnan and which she had given her son secretly   94.91047385661909
his eminence asks for the letter said bernouin passing back into the ante chamber   125.32677027785219
well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other   89.51293612816228
d artagnan drew up his request and m   173.24996731101098
after a moment s interval cocles appeared   171.23894197388395
he felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition teresa might escape him   90.07678385092089
as d artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been seen   120.0795118872129
you are right my dear rochefort it couldn t be for that   62.95162190263817
yes replied the count going to the door and returning   77.88709170315468
de la trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal s guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the king s musketeers   165.35721744009783
suddenly edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of fernand as it was defined in the shadow   135.48962257056988
go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible   156.13625240136744
in august we lost 300 000 francs at the beginning of the month but on the 13th we made up for it and we now find that our accounts reckoning from the first day of partnership up to yesterday when i closed them showed a capital of 2 400 000 francs that is 1 200 000 for each of us   139.59917948467768
villefort was no longer the civilized man   109.66356083162239
fine vengeance that on my faith   4.3660695302010595
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hôtel   200.2602828327024
bonacieux who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the louvre was abducted   69.49938031679486
and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance   135.74234792446296
the count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions   83.9117584387763
it has its own effect upon the most incredulous   104.35640348920568
she gave me none   98.73273485349398
don t you think so d artagnan   137.52324206333256
then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the stairs   138.33118701445565
for the story   74.53242132432544
monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out   129.7271531379551
i was then obliged to come back again   157.65942372304573
pray relate it to me   206.55234907358624
ing invited to dine by his holiness alexander vi   166.4707884104207
we are alone   105.04659921687171
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood   28.059190647974404
had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend   78.83940261577186
another motive had influenced albert s selection of his seat who knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival   128.97054876933515
give up this letter you have brought from elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your friends   174.52100400045558
he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid   80.42887608394199
i feared it maximilian said she   104.31027123442577
the next morning at the same hour the jailer came again   88.08467785881868
and your regiment your captain   78.81578718388559
you have truly inconceivable ideas   170.20424365328807
the italian to the gallows   41.16460014002949
he proposed to fernand to accompany him   168.86371310693818
good my son   168.15280514456202
so he s called mouston thought d artagnan   117.0229352295374
the guards looked on it with indifference   103.71665019239283
the king looked towards him   100.67850928268433
it is not for me to judge   109.97840707846159
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at d artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship   127.69880924200508
felton abandon me   185.99203599758428
but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence   136.51270144447898
i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived   166.93473137246173
a groan stifled by the grasp of porthos was all the reply of poor blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank   204.36018006538853
ah my worthy gentlemen cried i what do you want   135.6635398350262
40260m i will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid   98.9542151816076
he took the opportunity of calling out his guard the swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the palais royal on the quays and on the pont neuf   153.36296347752085
about my height   175.9291002071077
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans   76.82099305267974
cried d artagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation   60.612036304683144
and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion   13.993968019034384
de la trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king   128.174440771323
oh i would advance ten millions on his signature   117.67487664829018
i will give it to none but the king monsieur said anne   134.16043312015225
d artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues   81.60975507359089
if richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great   146.31809412399576
then all at once it ceased   55.50435106937667
i wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen   135.41686394641016
the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance   135.6950448207369
at that instant the countess perceived franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head   88.15563673487586
it would be impossible   128.95666337659299
ah he is one who fears neither god nor satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service   164.92535630698146
if you have seen all madame you know that the son of fernand has publicly insulted me said monte cristo with awful calmness   111.5697455257
but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another   131.7673539309887
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand   89.58392971115364
draw if you please and instantly not so if you please my good friend not here at least   61.04227520721734
now he said to teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be   216.06503373215477
ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured edmond   163.974126807868
i wish we were already there said d artagnan   142.60885087562855
has not some sage said nothing too much   91.48724836546882
franz cried albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now   110.16541075385234
oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairy scene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget   152.47008601375862
why this fellow must be the devil in person   145.69129202130694
he who had just abandoned 5 000 000 endeavored to save the 50 000 francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privation he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness   107.8576988999195
and he returned to his companions   85.79094462685485
di quà said one of the men descending a little path leading out of the appian way   41.91124101999256
he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precaution s sake   130.14560978369164
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it   158.07521248650875
then will she die too   65.7672011230882
but monte cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man sir said he in a solemn tone i consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet   69.42987659991608
charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman   70.2314565218866
the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired   87.16884580897359
bonacieux with a half smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience   92.26915940474959
danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips   62.908778284495185
no but somebody has gone in   93.60625581078314
the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him   104.41259075469156
she then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives   128.23639635742973
athos was more delighted than can be told   88.00987374353096
the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello   119.0739228384084
monsieur de tréville must think us dead   126.4252473482357
inquired danglars visibly agitated   92.774763583665
it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance   246.97239471384376
it was like the first empty   106.77621183143786
all you do will be well done   203.13669515237663
rather place faith in what i tell you   43.24586804151785
mazarin as a statesman will understand the politic necessity   102.36027020967504
and i am truly pleased to meet you   113.59934904177504
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room   91.82170987510105
and if you will seek your enemy i will assist you and i will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours   169.035534802322
then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter   30.005928013627027
she entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the count s attention   115.4260145319484
and what do you know about the state you talk of   170.71405884141743
he was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure   139.97801077401886
but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared   100.78922942965302
my dear friend cried aramis   21.82190427233172
0301m dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice   105.23120619272625
you would take your gun you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog   138.56920285583243
that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window   76.39688839717941
here i shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my death   106.05433342125633
cried one of his companions don t try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity   144.09041847656397
now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person   145.28910208765572
